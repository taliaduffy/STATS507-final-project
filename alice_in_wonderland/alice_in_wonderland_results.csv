Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
“without pictures or conversations?”",1,disgust,0.4126524031162262,0.07756058126688004,0.4126524031162262,0.18486042320728302,0.007870662026107311,0.1290661245584488,0.08540016412734985,0.1025896668434143
"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.",5,sadness,0.48315948247909546,0.031803715974092484,0.010925454087555408,0.04125833883881569,0.00530447531491518,0.01631755568087101,0.48315948247909546,0.4112309515476227

"I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried
on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.",6,surprise,0.5576257109642029,0.11794260144233704,0.027181467041373253,0.055254723876714706,0.011193699203431606,0.21094633638858795,0.019855447113513947,0.5576257109642029

up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:—",4,neutral,0.3100581169128418,0.04456355795264244,0.025170816108584404,0.16085906326770782,0.06000237166881561,0.3100581169128418,0.12064626812934875,0.27869975566864014
"First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.",4,neutral,0.45295706391334534,0.029540598392486572,0.057497382164001465,0.12459859997034073,0.0770043209195137,0.45295706391334534,0.016651997342705727,0.24175001680850983
"The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the
frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
Turtle.",5,sadness,0.3885125517845154,0.17047254741191864,0.03834212198853493,0.20348110795021057,0.00717288488522172,0.1801239252090454,0.3885125517845154,0.01189486961811781
"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock
Turtle’s heavy sobs.",5,sadness,0.3048416078090668,0.15339742600917816,0.16445928812026978,0.2360951006412506,0.012232271023094654,0.09800606966018677,0.3048416078090668,0.030968233942985535
"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.",3,joy,0.3223208785057068,0.008283075876533985,0.006198097951710224,0.06702309846878052,0.3223208785057068,0.2754192352294922,0.19285045564174652,0.1279052197933197
