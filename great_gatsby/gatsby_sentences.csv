that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.",1
2,"“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just
remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages
that you’ve had.”",2
3,"He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative
in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more
than that.",3
4,"In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a
habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me
the victim of not a few veteran bores.",3
5,"The abnormal mind is quick to
detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal
person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of
being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,
unknown men.",3
6,"Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have
feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by
some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on
the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least
the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and
marred by obvious suppressions.",3
7,"Reserving judgements is a matter of
infinite hope.",3
8,"I am still a little afraid of missing something if I
forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly
repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out
unequally at birth.",3
9,"And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission
that it has a limit.",4
10,"Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the
wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded
on.",4
11,"When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted
the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I
wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the
human heart.",4
12,"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was
exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I
have an unaffected scorn.",4
13,"If personality is an unbroken series of
successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some
heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related
to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten
thousand miles away.",4
14,"This responsiveness had nothing to do with that
flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and
which it is not likely I shall ever find again.",4
15,"No—Gatsby turned out
all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust
floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my
interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.",4
16,"My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle
Western city for three generations.",6
17,"The Carraways are something of a
clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of
Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s
brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil
War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father
carries on today.",6
18,"I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with
special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in
father’s office.",7
19,"I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of
a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that
delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.",7
20,"I enjoyed the
counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.",7
21,"Instead of being
the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the
ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond
business.",7
22,"Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it
could support one more single man.",7
23,"All my aunts and uncles talked it
over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,
“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces.",7
24,"Father agreed to finance
me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I
thought, in the spring of twenty-two.",7
25,"The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm
season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly
trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a
house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea.",8
26,"He
found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a
month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and
I went out to the country alone.",8
27,"I had a dog—at least I had him for a
few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who
made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to
herself over the electric stove.",8
28,"It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more
recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.",9

30,I told him.,11
31,And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.,11
32,"I was a guide,
a pathfinder, an original settler.",11
33,"He had casually conferred on me the
freedom of the neighbourhood.",11
34,"And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the
trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar
conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.",12
35,"There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to
be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.",13
36,"I bought a dozen
volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they
stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,
promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and
Maecenas knew.",13
37,"And I had the high intention of reading many other
books besides.",13
38,"I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a
series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now
I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become
again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”
This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at
from a single window, after all.",13
39,"It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of
the strangest communities in North America.",14
40,"It was on that slender
riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where
there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of
land.",14
41,"Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in
contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most
domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great
wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.",14
42,"They are not perfect ovals—like the
egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact
end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual
wonder to the gulls that fly overhead.",14
43,"To the wingless a more
interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular
except shape and size.",14
44,"I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though
this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little
sinister contrast between them.",15
45,"My house was at the very tip of the
egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge
places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.",15
46,"The one on
my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual
imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one
side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble
swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.",15
47,"It was
Gatsby’s mansion.",15
48,"Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a
mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.",15
49,"My own house was an
eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I
had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and
the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a
month.",15
50,"Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg
glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins
on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom
Buchanans.",16
51,"Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom
in college.",16
52,"And just after the war I spent two days with them in
Chicago.",16
53,"Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of
the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a
national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute
limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of
anticlimax.",17
54,"His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his
freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago
and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for
instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake
Forest.",17
55,"It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was
wealthy enough to do that.",17
56,Why they came East I don’t know.,18
57,"They had spent a year in France for
no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully
wherever people played polo and were rich together.",18
58,"This was a
permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe
it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift
on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of
some irrecoverable football game.",18
59,"And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East
Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.",19
60,"Their house
was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white
Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay.",19
61,"The lawn started at
the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,
jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when
it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though
from the momentum of its run.",19
62,"The front was broken by a line of French
windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm
windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with
his legs apart on the front porch.",19
63,He had changed since his New Haven years.,20
64,"Now he was a sturdy
straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a
supercilious manner.",20
65,"Two shining arrogant eyes had established
dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning
aggressively forward.",20
66,"Not even the effeminate swank of his riding
clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill
those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could
see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his
thin coat.",20
67,It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.,20
68,"His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of
fractiousness he conveyed.",21
69,"There was a touch of paternal contempt in
it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who
had hated his guts.",21
70,"“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to
say, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We
were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I
always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like
him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.",22
71,We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.,23
72,"“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.",24
73,"Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the
front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half
acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped
the tide offshore.",25
74,"“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,
politely and abruptly.",26
75,“We’ll go inside.”,26
76,"We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,
fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.",27
77,"The
windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside
that seemed to grow a little way into the house.",27
78,"A breeze blew through
the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale
flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the
ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow
on it as wind does on the sea.",27
79,"The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous
couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an
anchored balloon.",28
80,"They were both in white, and their dresses were
rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a
short flight around the house.",28
81,"I must have stood for a few moments
listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a
picture on the wall.",28
82,"Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the
rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the
curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the
floor.",28
83,The younger of the two was a stranger to me.,29
84,"She was extended full
length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her
chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which
was quite likely to fall.",29
85,"If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes
she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring
an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.",29
86,"The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly
forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,
charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the
room.",30
87,“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”,31
88,"She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my
hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was
no one in the world she so much wanted to see.",32
89,"That was a way she
had.",32
90,"She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was
Baker.",32
91,"(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people
lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less
charming.)",32
92,"At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object
she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her
something of a fright.",33
93,Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.,33
94,"Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned
tribute from me.",33
95,"I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,
thrilling voice.",34
96,"It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and
down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be
played again.",34
97,"Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,
bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement
in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:
a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had
done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,
exciting things hovering in the next hour.",34
98,"I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,
and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.",35
99,“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.,36
100,“The whole town is desolate.,37
101,"All the cars have the left rear wheel
painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all
night along the north shore.”",37
102,“How gorgeous!,38
103,"Let’s go back, Tom.",38
104,"Tomorrow!” Then she added
irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”",38
105,“I’d like to.”,39
106,“She’s asleep.,40
107,She’s three years old.,40
108,Haven’t you ever seen her?”,40
109,“Never.”,41
110,"“Well, you ought to see her.",42
111,She’s—”,42
112,"Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped
and rested his hand on my shoulder.",43
113,"“What you doing, Nick?”",44
114,“I’m a bond man.”,45
115,“Who with?”,46
116,I told him.,47
117,"“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.",48
118,This annoyed me.,49
119,"“You will,” I answered shortly.",50
120,“You will if you stay in the East.”,50
121,"“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at
Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something
more.",51
122,“I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”,51
123,"At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that
I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the
room.",52
124,"Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned
and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.",52
125,"“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long
as I can remember.”",53
126,"“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to
New York all afternoon.”",54
127,"“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the
pantry.",55
128,“I’m absolutely in training.”,55
129,Her host looked at her incredulously.,56
130,"“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom
of a glass.",57
131,“How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”,57
132,"I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I
enjoyed looking at her.",58
133,"She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with
an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward
at the shoulders like a young cadet.",58
134,"Her grey sun-strained eyes looked
back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,
discontented face.",58
135,"It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a
picture of her, somewhere before.",58
136,"“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously.",59
137,"“I know somebody
there.”",59
138,“I don’t know a single—”,60
139,“You must know Gatsby.”,61
140,“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy.,62
141,“What Gatsby?”,62
142,"Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;
wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled
me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.",63
143,"Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two
young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward
the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the
diminished wind.",64
144,"“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning.",65
145,"She snapped them out with her
fingers.",65
146,"“In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She
looked at us all radiantly.",65
147,"“Do you always watch for the longest day
of the year and then miss it?",65
148,"I always watch for the longest day in
the year and then miss it.”",65
149,"“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the
table as if she were getting into bed.",66
150,"“All right,” said Daisy.",67
151,"“What’ll we plan?” She turned to me
helplessly: “What do people plan?”",67
152,"Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her
little finger.",68
153,“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”,69
154,We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.,70
155,"“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly.",71
156,"“I know you didn’t mean to,
but you did do it.",71
157,"That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a
great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”",71
158,"“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in
kidding.”",72
159,"“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.",73
160,"Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a
bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool
as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all
desire.",74
161,"They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a
polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.",74
162,"They knew
that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too
would be over and casually put away.",74
163,"It was sharply different from the
West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its
close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer
nervous dread of the moment itself.",74
164,"“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass
of corky but rather impressive claret.",75
165,"“Can’t you talk about crops or
something?”",75
166,"I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in
an unexpected way.",76
167,"“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently.",77
168,"“I’ve
gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.",77
169,"Have you read The Rise
of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”",77
170,"“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.",78
171,"“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.",79
172,"The idea is
if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly
submerged.",79
173,It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”,79
174,"“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of
unthoughtful sadness.",80
175,"“He reads deep books with long words in
them.",80
176,What was that word we—”,80
177,"“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her
impatiently.",81
178,“This fellow has worked out the whole thing.,81
179,"It’s up to
us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will
have control of things.”",81
180,"“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously
toward the fervent sun.",82
181,"“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom
interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.",83
182,“This idea is that we’re Nordics.,84
183,"I am, and you are, and you are,
and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a
slight nod, and she winked at me again.",84
184,"“—And we’ve produced all the
things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all
that.",84
185,Do you see?”,84
186,"There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his
complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.",85
187,"When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler
left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned
towards me.",85
188,"“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.",86
189,“It’s about the butler’s nose.,86
190,"Do you want to hear about the butler’s
nose?”",86
191,“That’s why I came over tonight.”,87
192,"“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher
for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred
people.",88
193,"He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it
began to affect his nose—”",88
194,"“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.",89
195,“Yes.,90
196,"Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up
his position.”",90
197,"For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her
glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I
listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering
regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.",91
198,"The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,
whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went
inside.",92
199,"As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned
forward again, her voice glowing and singing.",92
200,"“I love to see you at my table, Nick.",93
201,"You remind me of a—of a rose, an
absolute rose.",93
202,"Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:
“An absolute rose?”",93
203,This was untrue.,94
204,I am not even faintly like a rose.,94
205,"She was only
extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart
was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,
thrilling words.",94
206,"Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and
excused herself and went into the house.",94
207,"Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of
meaning.",95
208,"I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”
in a warning voice.",95
209,"A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the
room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to
hear.",95
210,"The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,
mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.",95
211,“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.,96
212,“Don’t talk.,97
213,I want to hear what happens.”,97
214,“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.,98
215,"“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.",99
216,“I thought everybody knew.”,99
217,“I don’t.”,100
218,“Why—” she said hesitantly.,101
219,“Tom’s got some woman in New York.”,101
220,“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.,102
221,Miss Baker nodded.,103
222,“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.,104
223,Don’t you think?”,104
224,"Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a
dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at
the table.",105
225,“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.,106
226,"She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and
continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic
outdoors.",107
227,"There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a
nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.",107
228,"He’s singing
away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”",107
229,"“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light
enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”",108
230,"The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head
decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,
vanished into air.",109
231,"Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes
at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I
was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to
avoid all eyes.",109
232,"I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but
I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain
hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill
metallic urgency out of mind.",109
233,"To a certain temperament the situation
might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone
immediately for the police.",109
234,"The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.",110
235,"Tom and Miss
Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into
the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,
trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed
Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.",110
236,"In
its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.",110
237,"Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and
her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.",111
238,"I saw that
turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be
some sedative questions about her little girl.",111
239,"“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly.",112
240,"“Even
if we are cousins.",112
241,You didn’t come to my wedding.”,112
242,“I wasn’t back from the war.”,113
243,“That’s true.” She hesitated.,114
244,"“Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,
and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”",114
245,Evidently she had reason to be.,115
246,"I waited but she didn’t say any more,
and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her
daughter.",115
247,"“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”",116
248,"“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently.",117
249,"“Listen, Nick; let me tell you
what I said when she was born.",117
250,Would you like to hear?”,117
251,“Very much.”,118
252,“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.,119
253,"Well, she was
less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where.",119
254,"I woke up out of
the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right
away if it was a boy or a girl.",119
255,"She told me it was a girl, and so I
turned my head away and wept.",119
256,"‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a
girl.",119
257,"And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be
in this world, a beautiful little fool.’",119
258,"“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a
convinced way.",120
259,“Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people.,120
260,"And I
know.",120
261,"I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”
Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and
she laughed with thrilling scorn.",120
262,"“Sophisticated—God, I’m
sophisticated!”",120
263,"The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my
belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.",121
264,"It made me
uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to
exact a contributory emotion from me.",121
265,"I waited, and sure enough, in a
moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as
if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret
society to which she and Tom belonged.",121
266,"Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.",123
267,"Tom and Miss Baker sat at
either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the
Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running
together in a soothing tune.",123
268,"The lamplight, bright on his boots and
dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as
she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.",123
269,When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.,124
270,"“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in
our very next issue.”",125
271,"Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she
stood up.",126
272,"“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the
ceiling.",127
273,“Time for this good girl to go to bed.”,127
274,"“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,
“over at Westchester.”",128
275,“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”,129
276,"I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous
expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the
sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach.",130
277,"I had heard
some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I
had forgotten long ago.",130
278,"“Good night,” she said softly.",131
279,"“Wake me at eight, won’t you.”",131
280,“If you’ll get up.”,132
281,“I will.,133
282,"Good night, Mr. Carraway.",133
283,See you anon.”,133
284,"“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy.",134
285,"“In fact I think I’ll arrange a
marriage.",134
286,"Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you
together.",134
287,"You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push
you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”",134
288,"“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs.",135
289,"“I haven’t heard a
word.”",135
290,"“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment.",136
291,"“They oughtn’t to let
her run around the country this way.”",136
292,“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.,137
293,“Her family.”,138
294,“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old.,139
295,"Besides, Nick’s
going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick?",139
296,"She’s going to spend lots
of weekends out here this summer.",139
297,"I think the home influence will be
very good for her.”",139
298,Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.,140
299,“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.,141
300,“From Louisville.,142
301,Our white girlhood was passed together there.,142
302,"Our
beautiful white—”",142
303,"“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”
demanded Tom suddenly.",143
304,“Did I?” She looked at me.,144
305,"“I can’t seem to remember, but I think we
talked about the Nordic race.",144
306,"Yes, I’m sure we did.",144
307,"It sort of crept
up on us and first thing you know—”",144
308,"“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.",145
309,"I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes
later I got up to go home.",146
310,"They came to the door with me and stood
side by side in a cheerful square of light.",146
311,"As I started my motor
Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!",146
312,"“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important.",147
313,"We heard you were
engaged to a girl out West.”",147
314,"“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly.",148
315,"“We heard that you were
engaged.”",148
316,“It’s a libel.,149
317,I’m too poor.”,149
318,"“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again
in a flower-like way.",150
319,"“We heard it from three people, so it must be
true.”",150
320,"Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even
vaguely engaged.",151
321,"The fact that gossip had published the banns was one
of the reasons I had come East.",151
322,"You can’t stop going with an old
friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention
of being rumoured into marriage.",151
323,"Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely
rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove
away.",152
324,"It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out
of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such
intentions in her head.",152
325,"As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman
in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been
depressed by a book.",152
326,"Something was making him nibble at the edge of
stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his
peremptory heart.",152
327,"Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside
garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and
when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and
sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard.",153
328,"The wind had
blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the
trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth
blew the frogs full of life.",153
329,"The silhouette of a moving cat wavered
across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I
was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of
my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets
regarding the silver pepper of the stars.",153
330,"Something in his leisurely
movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested
that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was
his of our local heavens.",153
331,I decided to call to him.,154
332,"Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and
that would do for an introduction.",154
333,"But I didn’t call to him, for he
gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched
out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was
from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.",154
334,"Involuntarily I glanced
seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute
and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.",154
335,"When I looked
once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the
unquiet darkness.",154
336,"
                                  II",155
337,"About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily
joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as
to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land.",156
338,"This is a valley
of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and
hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and
chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of
ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery
air.",156
339,"Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,
gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the
ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable
cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.",156
340,"But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift
endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.
J. Eckleburg.",157
341,"The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and
gigantic—their retinas are one yard high.",157
342,"They look out of no face,
but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass
over a nonexistent nose.",157
343,"Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set
them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then
sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved
away.",157
344,"But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun
and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.",157
345,"The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,
when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on
waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an
hour.",158
346,"There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was
because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.",158
347,The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known.,159
348,"His
acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés
with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with
whomsoever he knew.",159
349,"Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire
to meet her—but I did.",159
350,"I went up to New York with Tom on the train one
afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet
and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.",159
351,"“We’re getting off,” he insisted.",160
352,“I want you to meet my girl.”,160
353,"I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination
to have my company bordered on violence.",161
354,"The supercilious assumption
was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.",161
355,"I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked
back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s
persistent stare.",162
356,"The only building in sight was a small block of
yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact
Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.",162
357,"One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an
all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a
garage—Repairs.",162
358,George B. Wilson.,162
359,"Cars bought and sold.—and I followed
Tom inside.",162
360,"The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the
dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.",163
361,"It had
occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that
sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the
proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands
on a piece of waste.",163
362,"He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and
faintly handsome.",163
363,"When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his
light blue eyes.",163
364,"“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the
shoulder.",164
365,“How’s business?”,164
366,"“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly.",165
367,"“When are you
going to sell me that car?”",165
368,“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”,166
369,"“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”",167
370,"“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly.",168
371,"“And if you feel that way about it,
maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”",168
372,"“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly.",169
373,“I just meant—”,169
374,His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.,170
375,"Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish
figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.",170
376,"She was
in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh
sensuously as some women can.",170
377,"Her face, above a spotted dress of dark
blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there
was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of
her body were continually smouldering.",170
378,"She smiled slowly and, walking
through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,
looking him flush in the eye.",170
379,"Then she wet her lips, and without
turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:",170
380,"“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”",171
381,"“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little
office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls.",172
382,"A
white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled
everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.",172
383,"“I want to see you,” said Tom intently.",173
384,“Get on the next train.”,173
385,“All right.”,174
386,“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”,175
387,"She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with
two chairs from his office door.",176
388,We waited for her down the road and out of sight.,177
389,"It was a few days
before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was
setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.",177
390,"“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor
Eckleburg.",178
391,“Awful.”,179
392,“It does her good to get away.”,180
393,“Doesn’t her husband object?”,181
394,“Wilson?,182
395,He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York.,182
396,"He’s so
dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”",182
397,"So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not
quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car.",183
398,"Tom
deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might
be on the train.",183
399,"She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched
tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in
New York.",184
400,"At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a
moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream
and a small flask of perfume.",184
401,"Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive
she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,
lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from
the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.",184
402,"But immediately she
turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the
front glass.",184
403,"“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly.",185
404,"“I want to get
one for the apartment.",185
405,They’re nice to have—a dog.”,185
406,"We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John
D. Rockefeller.",186
407,"In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very
recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.",186
408,"“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the
taxi-window.",187
409,“All kinds.,188
410,"What kind do you want, lady?”",188
411,"“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got
that kind?”",189
412,"The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and
drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.",190
413,"“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.",191
414,"“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment
in his voice.",192
415,"“It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the
brown washrag of a back.",192
416,“Look at that coat.,192
417,Some coat.,192
418,"That’s a dog
that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”",192
419,"“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically.",193
420,"“How much is
it?”",193
421,“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly.,194
422,"“That dog will cost you ten
dollars.”",194
423,"The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it
somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and
settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the
weatherproof coat with rapture.",195
424,“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.,196
425,“That dog?,197
426,That dog’s a boy.”,197
427,"“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively.",198
428,“Here’s your money.,198
429,"Go and buy
ten more dogs with it.”",198
430,"We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the
summer Sunday afternoon.",199
431,"I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great
flock of white sheep turn the corner.",199
432,"“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”",200
433,"“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly.",201
434,"“Myrtle’ll be hurt if you
don’t come up to the apartment.",201
435,"Won’t you, Myrtle?”",201
436,"“Come on,” she urged.",202
437,“I’ll telephone my sister Catherine.,202
438,"She’s said
to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”",202
439,"“Well, I’d like to, but—”",203
440,"We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.",204
441,"At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of
apartment-houses.",204
442,"Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the
neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other
purchases, and went haughtily in.",204
443,"“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in
the elevator.",205
444,"“And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”",205
445,"The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small
dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath.",206
446,"The living-room was crowded
to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for
it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of
ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.",206
447,"The only picture was an
over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.",206
448,"Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a
bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the
room.",206
449,"Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with
a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines
of Broadway.",206
450,Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog.,206
451,"A reluctant
elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he
added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of
which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all
afternoon.",206
452,"Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked
bureau door.",206
453,"I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that
afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,
although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful
sun.",207
454,"Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the
telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some
at the drugstore on the corner.",207
455,"When I came back they had both
disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a
chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the
whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.",207
456,"Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called
each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive
at the apartment door.",208
457,"The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,
with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky
white.",209
458,"Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more
rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the
old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.",209
459,"When she moved about
there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets
jingled up and down upon her arms.",209
460,"She came in with such a proprietary
haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I
wondered if she lived here.",209
461,"But when I asked her she laughed
immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a
girl friend at a hotel.",209
462,"Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below.",210
463,"He had just
shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he
was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.",210
464,"He
informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later
that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of
Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.",210
465,"His
wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible.",210
466,"She told me with
pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven
times since they had been married.",210
467,"Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now
attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,
which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.",211
468,"With
the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a
change.",211
469,"The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage
was converted into impressive hauteur.",211
470,"Her laughter, her gestures, her
assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she
expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be
revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.",211
471,"“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of
these fellas will cheat you every time.",212
472,All they think of is money.,212
473,"I
had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me
the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”",212
474,“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.,213
475,“Mrs.,214
476,Eberhardt.,214
477,"She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own
homes.”",214
478,"“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”",215
479,Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.,216
480,"“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said.",217
481,"“I just slip it on sometimes
when I don’t care what I look like.”",217
482,"“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.
McKee.",218
483,"“If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could
make something of it.”",218
484,"We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair
from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.",219
485,"Mr.
McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved
his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.",219
486,"“I should change the light,” he said after a moment.",220
487,"“I’d like to
bring out the modelling of the features.",220
488,"And I’d try to get hold of
all the back hair.”",220
489,"“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee.",221
490,"“I think
it’s—”",221
491,"Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,
whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.",222
492,"“You McKees have something to drink,” he said.",223
493,"“Get some more ice and
mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”",223
494,"“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair
at the shiftlessness of the lower orders.",224
495,“These people!,224
496,"You have to
keep after them all the time.”",224
497,She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.,225
498,"Then she flounced over to
the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying
that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.",225
499,"“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.",226
500,Tom looked at him blankly.,227
501,“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”,228
502,“Two what?” demanded Tom.,229
503,“Two studies.,230
504,"One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and the
other I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”",230
505,The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.,231
506,"“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.",232
507,“I live at West Egg.”,233
508,“Really?,234
509,I was down there at a party about a month ago.,234
510,"At a man named
Gatsby’s.",234
511,Do you know him?”,234
512,“I live next door to him.”,235
513,"“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s.",236
514,"That’s
where all his money comes from.”",236
515,“Really?”,237
516,She nodded.,238
517,“I’m scared of him.,239
518,I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”,239
519,"This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.
McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:",240
520,"“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but
Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.",241
521,"“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.",242
522,All I ask is that they should give me a start.”,242
523,"“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as
Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.",243
524,"“She’ll give you a letter of
introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”",243
525,"“Do what?” she asked, startled.",244
526,"“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can
do some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as he
invented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like
that.”",245
527,Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:,246
528,“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”,247
529,“Can’t they?”,248
530,“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom.,249
531,"“What I say
is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them?",249
532,"If I was them
I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”",249
533,“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”,250
534,The answer to this was unexpected.,251
535,"It came from Myrtle, who had
overheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.",251
536,"“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly.",252
537,She lowered her voice again.,252
538,“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart.,252
539,"She’s a Catholic, and
they don’t believe in divorce.”",252
540,"Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the
elaborateness of the lie.",253
541,"“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going West
to live for a while until it blows over.”",254
542,“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”,255
543,"“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly.",256
544,"“I just got back
from Monte Carlo.”",256
545,“Really.”,257
546,“Just last year.,258
547,I went over there with another girl.”,258
548,“Stay long?”,259
549,"“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.",260
550,"We went by way of
Marseilles.",260
551,"We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we
got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.",260
552,"We had an
awful time getting back, I can tell you.",260
553,"God, how I hated that town!”",260
554,"The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the
blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee
called me back into the room.",261
555,"“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously.",262
556,"“I almost
married a little kike who’d been after me for years.",262
557,"I knew he was
below me.",262
558,"Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below
you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”",262
559,"“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,
“at least you didn’t marry him.”",263
560,“I know I didn’t.”,264
561,"“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously.",265
562,"“And that’s the
difference between your case and mine.”",265
563,"“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine.",266
564,“Nobody forced you to.”,266
565,Myrtle considered.,267
566,"“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she said
finally.",268
567,"“I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t
fit to lick my shoe.”",268
568,"“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.",269
569,“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously.,270
570,"“Who said I was crazy
about him?",270
571,"I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that
man there.”",270
572,"She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly.",271
573,"I
tried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.",271
574,“The only crazy I was was when I married him.,272
575,"I knew right away I made
a mistake.",272
576,"He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and
never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he
was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said.",272
577,"‘This is the first I ever
heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to
beat the band all afternoon.”",272
578,"“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.",273
579,“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years.,273
580,"And Tom’s the
first sweetie she ever had.”",273
581,"The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all
present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at
all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated
sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves.",274
582,"I wanted to
get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,
but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident
argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair.",274
583,"Yet
high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed
their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening
streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering.",274
584,"I was within and
without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible
variety of life.",274
585,"Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath
poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.",275
586,"“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the
last ones left on the train.",276
587,"I was going up to New York to see my
sister and spend the night.",276
588,"He had on a dress suit and patent leather
shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked
at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his
head.",276
589,"When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white
shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call
a policeman, but he knew I lied.",276
590,"I was so excited that when I got into
a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway
train.",276
591,"All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live
forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”",276
592,"She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial
laughter.",277
593,"“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m
through with it.",278
594,I’ve got to get another one tomorrow.,278
595,"I’m going to
make a list of all the things I’ve got to get.",278
596,"A massage and a wave,
and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where
you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s
grave that’ll last all summer.",278
597,"I got to write down a list so I won’t
forget all the things I got to do.”",278
598,"It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch
and found it was ten.",279
599,"Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists
clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action.",279
600,"Taking out
my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that
had worried me all the afternoon.",279
601,"The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes
through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly.",280
602,"People
disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost
each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet
away.",280
603,"Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood
face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson
had any right to mention Daisy’s name.",280
604,“Daisy!,281
605,Daisy!,281
606,Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson.,281
607,"“I’ll say it whenever I
want to!",281
608,Daisy!,281
609,Dai—”,281
610,"Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his
open hand.",282
611,"Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s
voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of
pain.",283
612,"Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the
door.",283
613,"When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the
scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled
here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and
the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to
spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of
Versailles.",283
614,Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.,283
615,"Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.",283
616,"“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the
elevator.",284
617,“Where?”,285
618,“Anywhere.”,286
619,"“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.",287
620,"“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I was
touching it.”",288
621,"“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”",289
622,"… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the
sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.",290
623,"“Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’n
Bridge …”",291
624,"Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the
Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for
the four o’clock train.",292
625,"
                                 III",293
626,There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.,294
627,"In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the
whisperings and the champagne and the stars.",294
628,"At high tide in the
afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or
taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats
slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of
foam.",294
629,"On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties
to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past
midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to
meet all trains.",294
630,"And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra
gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers
and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.",294
631,"Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a
fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left
his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves.",295
632,"There was a machine in
the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in
half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a
butler’s thumb.",295
633,"At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several
hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas
tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden.",296
634,"On buffet tables, garnished with
glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of
harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark
gold.",296
635,"In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and
stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that
most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.",296
636,"By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,
but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and
cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.",297
637,"The last swimmers have
come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from
New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and
salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in
strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.",297
638,"The bar is
in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden
outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual
innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic
meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.",297
639,"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and
now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of
voices pitches a key higher.",298
640,"Laughter is easier minute by minute,
spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.",298
641,"The groups
change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the
same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave
here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,
joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,
glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under
the constantly changing light.",298
642,"Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail
out of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands like
Frisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform.",299
643,"A momentary hush; the
orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is a
burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda
Gray’s understudy from the Follies.",299
644,The party has begun.,299
645,"I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one
of the few guests who had actually been invited.",300
646,"People were not
invited—they went there.",300
647,"They got into automobiles which bore them out
to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door.",300
648,"Once there
they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that they
conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated
with an amusement park.",300
649,"Sometimes they came and went without having
met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that
was its own ticket of admission.",300
650,I had been actually invited.,301
651,"A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg
blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly
formal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,
it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night.",301
652,"He had seen
me several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but a
peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay
Gatsby, in a majestic hand.",301
653,"Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after
seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies
of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed
on the commuting train.",302
654,"I was immediately struck by the number of
young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little
hungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperous
Americans.",302
655,"I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or
insurance or automobiles.",302
656,"They were at least agonizingly aware of the
easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few
words in the right key.",302
657,"As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two or
three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an
amazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,
that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place
in the garden where a single man could linger without looking
purposeless and alone.",303
658,"I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when
Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble
steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous
interest down into the garden.",304
659,"Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone
before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.",305
660,"“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her.",306
661,"My voice seemed unnaturally
loud across the garden.",306
662,"“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.",307
663,“I remembered you lived next door to—”,307
664,"She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me
in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who
stopped at the foot of the steps.",308
665,“Hello!” they cried together.,309
666,“Sorry you didn’t win.”,309
667,That was for the golf tournament.,310
668,"She had lost in the finals the week
before.",310
669,"“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we
met you here about a month ago.”",311
670,"“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,
but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to
the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a
caterer’s basket.",312
671,"With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we
descended the steps and sauntered about the garden.",312
672,"A tray of
cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a
table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced
to us as Mr. Mumble.",312
673,"“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl
beside her.",313
674,"“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an
alert confident voice.",314
675,"She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for
you, Lucille?”",314
676,"It was for Lucille, too.",315
677,"“I like to come,” Lucille said.",316
678,"“I never care what I do, so I always
have a good time.",316
679,"When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and
he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from
Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”",316
680,“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.,317
681,“Sure I did.,318
682,"I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the
bust and had to be altered.",318
683,It was gas blue with lavender beads.,318
684,"Two
hundred and sixty-five dollars.”",318
685,"“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”
said the other girl eagerly.",319
686,"“He doesn’t want any trouble with
anybody.”",319
687,“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.,320
688,“Gatsby.,321
689,Somebody told me—”,321
690,The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.,322
691,“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”,323
692,A thrill passed over all of us.,324
693,"The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and
listened eagerly.",324
694,"“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s
more that he was a German spy during the war.”",325
695,One of the men nodded in confirmation.,326
696,"“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in
Germany,” he assured us positively.",327
697,"“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in
the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to
her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.",328
698,"“You look at him sometimes
when he thinks nobody’s looking at him.",328
699,I’ll bet he killed a man.”,328
700,She narrowed her eyes and shivered.,329
701,Lucille shivered.,329
702,"We all turned
and looked around for Gatsby.",329
703,"It was testimony to the romantic
speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those
who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this
world.",329
704,"The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now
being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were
spread around a table on the other side of the garden.",330
705,"There were
three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate
given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that
sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a
greater or lesser degree.",330
706,"Instead of rambling, this party had
preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function
of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg
condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its
spectroscopic gaiety.",330
707,"“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and
inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”",331
708,"We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I
had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.",332
709,"The
undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.",332
710,"The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not
there.",333
711,"She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t
on the veranda.",333
712,"On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and
walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,
and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.",333
713,"A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was
sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with
unsteady concentration at the shelves of books.",334
714,"As we entered he
wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.",334
715,“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.,335
716,“About what?”,336
717,He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.,337
718,“About that.,338
719,As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain.,338
720,"I
ascertained.",338
721,They’re real.”,338
722,“The books?”,339
723,He nodded.,340
724,“Absolutely real—have pages and everything.,341
725,"I thought they’d be a nice
durable cardboard.",341
726,"Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.",341
727,"Pages
and—Here!",341
728,Lemme show you.”,341
729,"Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and
returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.",342
730,“See!” he cried triumphantly.,343
731,"“It’s a bona-fide piece of printed
matter.",343
732,It fooled me.,343
733,This fella’s a regular Belasco.,343
734,"It’s a
triumph.",343
735,What thoroughness!,343
736,What realism!,343
737,"Knew when to stop,
too—didn’t cut the pages.",343
738,But what do you want?,343
739,What do you expect?”,343
740,"He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,
muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable
to collapse.",344
741,“Who brought you?” he demanded.,345
742,“Or did you just come?,345
743,I was brought.,345
744,Most people were brought.”,345
745,"Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.",346
746,"“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued.",347
747,“Mrs.,347
748,"Claud
Roosevelt.",347
749,Do you know her?,347
750,I met her somewhere last night.,347
751,"I’ve been
drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit
in a library.”",347
752,“Has it?”,348
753,"“A little bit, I think.",349
754,I can’t tell yet.,349
755,I’ve only been here an hour.,349
756,Did I tell you about the books?,349
757,They’re real.,349
758,They’re—”,349
759,“You told us.”,350
760,We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.,351
761,"There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing
young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples
holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the
corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or
relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the
traps.",352
762,By midnight the hilarity had increased.,352
763,"A celebrated tenor had
sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and
between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,
while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky.",352
764,"A
pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a
baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than
finger-bowls.",352
765,"The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was
a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny
drip of the banjoes on the lawn.",352
766,I was still with Jordan Baker.,353
767,"We were sitting at a table with a man
of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the
slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.",353
768,"I was enjoying
myself now.",353
769,"I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene
had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and
profound.",353
770,At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.,354
771,"“Your face is familiar,” he said politely.",355
772,"“Weren’t you in the First
Division during the war?”",355
773,“Why yes.,356
774,I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”,356
775,“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen.,357
776,"I knew I’d seen
you somewhere before.”",357
777,"We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.",358
778,"Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just
bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.",358
779,"“Want to go with me, old sport?",359
780,Just near the shore along the Sound.”,359
781,“What time?”,360
782,“Any time that suits you best.”,361
783,"It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked
around and smiled.",362
784,“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.,363
785,“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance.,364
786,"“This is an
unusual party for me.",364
787,I haven’t even seen the host.,364
788,"I live over
there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and
this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”",364
789,For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.,365
790,"“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.",366
791,“What!” I exclaimed.,367
792,"“Oh, I beg your pardon.”",367
793,"“I thought you knew, old sport.",368
794,I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”,368
795,He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly.,369
796,"It was one
of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that
you may come across four or five times in life.",369
797,"It faced—or seemed to
face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on
you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.",369
798,"It understood you
just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you
would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had
precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to
convey.",369
799,"Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an
elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate
formality of speech just missed being absurd.",369
800,"Some time before he
introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his
words with care.",369
801,"Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler
hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him
on the wire.",370
802,"He excused himself with a small bow that included each of
us in turn.",370
803,"“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.",371
804,“Excuse me.,371
805,I will rejoin you later.”,371
806,"When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure
her of my surprise.",372
807,"I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid
and corpulent person in his middle years.",372
808,“Who is he?” I demanded.,373
809,“Do you know?”,373
810,“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”,374
811,"“Where is he from, I mean?",375
812,And what does he do?”,375
813,"“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.",376
814,"“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”",376
815,"A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next
remark it faded away.",377
816,"“However, I don’t believe it.”",378
817,“Why not?”,379
818,"“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”",380
819,"Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he
killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.",381
820,"I would
have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from
the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.",381
821,"That
was comprehensible.",381
822,"But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial
inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and
buy a palace on Long Island Sound.",381
823,"“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject
with an urban distaste for the concrete.",382
824,“And I like large parties.,382
825,They’re so intimate.,382
826,At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”,382
827,"There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra
leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.",383
828,"“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried.",384
829,"“At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are
going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which
attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May.",384
830,"If you read the
papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial
condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody
laughed.",384
831,"“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s
Jazz History of the World!’ ”",385
832,"The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it
began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and
looking from one group to another with approving eyes.",386
833,"His tanned skin
was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as
though it were trimmed every day.",386
834,"I could see nothing sinister about
him.",386
835,"I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him
off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as
the fraternal hilarity increased.",386
836,"When the “Jazz History of the World”
was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a
puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into
men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their
falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched
Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s
head for one link.",386
837,“I beg your pardon.”,387
838,Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.,388
839,“Miss Baker?” he inquired.,389
840,"“I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would
like to speak to you alone.”",389
841,“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.,390
842,"“Yes, madame.”",391
843,"She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and
followed the butler toward the house.",392
844,"I noticed that she wore her
evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a
jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk
upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.",392
845,I was alone and it was almost two.,393
846,"For some time confused and
intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which
overhung the terrace.",393
847,"Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now
engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who
implored me to join him, I went inside.",393
848,The large room was full of people.,394
849,"One of the girls in yellow was
playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady
from a famous chorus, engaged in song.",394
850,"She had drunk a quantity of
champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,
that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was
weeping too.",394
851,"Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with
gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering
soprano.",394
852,"The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for
when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they
assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow
black rivulets.",394
853,"A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes
on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and
went off into a deep vinous sleep.",394
854,"“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a
girl at my elbow.",395
855,I looked around.,396
856,"Most of the remaining women were now having fights
with men said to be their husbands.",396
857,"Even Jordan’s party, the quartet
from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension.",396
858,"One of the men was
talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after
attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent
way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals
she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:
“You promised!” into his ear.",396
859,The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men.,397
860,"The hall
was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly
indignant wives.",397
861,"The wives were sympathizing with each other in
slightly raised voices.",397
862,“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”,398
863,“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”,399
864,“We’re always the first ones to leave.”,400
865,“So are we.”,401
866,"“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.",402
867,“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”,402
868,"In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond
credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives
were lifted, kicking, into the night.",403
869,"As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and
Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.",404
870,"He was saying some last
word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into
formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.",404
871,"Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she
lingered for a moment to shake hands.",405
872,"“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered.",406
873,"“How long
were we in there?”",406
874,"“Why, about an hour.”",407
875,"“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly.",408
876,"“But I swore I
wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully
in my face.",408
877,"“Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of
Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she
talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her
party at the door.",408
878,"Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I
joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him.",409
879,"I
wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to
apologize for not having known him in the garden.",409
880,"“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly.",410
881,"“Don’t give it another
thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity
than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder.",410
882,"“And don’t
forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine
o’clock.”",410
883,"Then the butler, behind his shoulder:",411
884,"“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”",412
885,"“All right, in a minute.",413
886,Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”,413
887,“Good night.”,414
888,"“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant
significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired
it all the time.",415
889,"“Good night, old sport … Good night.”",415
890,"But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite
over.",416
891,"Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a
bizarre and tumultuous scene.",416
892,"In the ditch beside the road, right side
up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had
left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before.",416
893,"The sharp jut of a wall
accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting
considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.",416
894,"However,
as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din
from those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to
the already violent confusion of the scene.",416
895,"A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in
the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the
tyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.",417
896,“See!” he explained.,418
897,“It went in the ditch.”,418
898,"The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the
unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of
Gatsby’s library.",419
899,“How’d it happen?”,420
900,He shrugged his shoulders.,421
901,"“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.",422
902,“But how did it happen?,423
903,Did you run into the wall?”,423
904,"“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole
matter.",424
905,“I know very little about driving—next to nothing.,424
906,"It
happened, and that’s all I know.”",424
907,"“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”",425
908,"“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t even
trying.”",426
909,An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.,427
910,“Do you want to commit suicide?”,428
911,“You’re lucky it was just a wheel!,429
912,A bad driver and not even trying!”,429
913,"“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal.",430
914,“I wasn’t driving.,430
915,There’s another man in the car.”,430
916,"The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained
“Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.",431
917,"The crowd—it was
now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened
wide there was a ghostly pause.",431
918,"Then, very gradually, part by part, a
pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively
at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.",431
919,"Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant
groaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment
before he perceived the man in the duster.",432
920,“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly.,433
921,“Did we run outa gas?”,433
922,“Look!”,434
923,"Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it
for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it
had dropped from the sky.",435
924,"“It came off,” someone explained.",436
925,He nodded.,437
926,“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”,438
927,A pause.,439
928,"Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,
he remarked in a determined voice:",439
929,“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”,440
930,"At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,
explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any
physical bond.",441
931,"“Back out,” he suggested after a moment.",442
932,“Put her in reverse.”,442
933,“But the wheel’s off!”,443
934,He hesitated.,444
935,"“No harm in trying,” he said.",445
936,"The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and
cut across the lawn toward home.",446
937,I glanced back once.,446
938,"A wafer of a
moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,
and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.",446
939,"A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great
doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who
stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.",446
940,"Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the
impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were
all that absorbed me.",448
941,"On the contrary, they were merely casual events
in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me
infinitely less than my personal affairs.",448
942,Most of the time I worked.,449
943,"In the early morning the sun threw my
shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York
to the Probity Trust.",449
944,"I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen
by their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded
restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.",449
945,"I
even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and
worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing
mean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I
let it blow quietly away.",449
946,"I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the
gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and
studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.",450
947,"There
were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the
library, so it was a good place to work.",450
948,"After that, if the night was
mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,
and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.",450
949,"I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,
and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and
machines gives to the restless eye.",451
950,"I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue
and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few
minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever
know or disapprove.",451
951,"Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their
apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and
smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm
darkness.",451
952,"At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting
loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who
loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary
restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant
moments of night and life.",451
953,"Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined
five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I
felt a sinking in my heart.",452
954,"Forms leaned together in the taxis as they
waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,
and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside.",452
955,"Imagining
that I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate
excitement, I wished them well.",452
956,"For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I
found her again.",453
957,"At first I was flattered to go places with her,
because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name.",453
958,"Then it
was something more.",453
959,"I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of
tender curiosity.",453
960,"The bored haughty face that she turned to the world
concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,
even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it
was.",453
961,"When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a
borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about
it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me
that night at Daisy’s.",453
962,"At her first big golf tournament there was a
row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved
her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round.",453
963,"The thing approached
the proportions of a scandal—then died away.",453
964,"A caddy retracted his
statement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been
mistaken.",453
965,The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.,453
966,"Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw
that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence
from a code would be thought impossible.",454
967,She was incurably dishonest.,454
968,"She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this
unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she
was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to
the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.",454
969,It made no difference to me.,455
970,"Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you
never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.",455
971,"It was on
that same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving
a car.",455
972,"It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our
fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.",455
973,"“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested.",456
974,"“Either you ought to be more
careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”",456
975,“I am careful.”,457
976,"“No, you’re not.”",458
977,"“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.",459
978,“What’s that got to do with it?”,460
979,"“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted.",461
980,"“It takes two to make an
accident.”",461
981,“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”,462
982,"“I hope I never will,” she answered.",463
983,“I hate careless people.,463
984,"That’s
why I like you.”",463
985,"Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had
deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved
her.",464
986,"But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as
brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself
definitely out of that tangle back home.",464
987,"I’d been writing letters once
a week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of was
how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of
perspiration appeared on her upper lip.",464
988,"Nevertheless there was a vague
understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.",464
989,"Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and
this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever
known.",465
990,"
                                  IV",466
991,"On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,
the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled
hilariously on his lawn.",467
992,"“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between
his cocktails and his flowers.",468
993,"“One time he killed a man who had found
out that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to the
devil.",468
994,"Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there
crystal glass.”",468
995,"Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of
those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer.",469
996,"It is an old timetable
now, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effect
July 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they will
give you a better impression than my generalities of those who
accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of
knowing nothing whatever about him.",469
997,"From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a
man named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who
was drowned last summer up in Maine.",470
998,"And the Hornbeams and the Willie
Voltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a
corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came
near.",470
999,"And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and
Mr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned
cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.",470
1000,"Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.",471
1001,"He came only once,
in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the
garden.",471
1002,"From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.
R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the
Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.",471
1003,"Snell was there three days before he
went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that
Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand.",471
1004,"The Dancies
came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice
A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and
Beluga’s girls.",471
1005,"From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and
Cecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who
controlled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don
S. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the
movies in one way or another.",472
1006,"And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.
Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his
wife.",472
1007,"Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.",472
1008,"(“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to
gamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was
cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably
next day.",472
1009,"A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as
“the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home.",473
1010,"Of theatrical people
there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George
Duckweed and Francis Bull.",473
1011,"Also from New York were the Chromes and the
Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and
the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the
Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who
killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.",473
1012,Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls.,474
1013,"They were never quite
the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with
another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.",474
1014,"I have
forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria
or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names
of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American
capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves
to be.",474
1015,"In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came
there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had
his nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,
his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of
the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be
her chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and
whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.",475
1016,All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.,476
1017,"At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car
lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody
from its three-noted horn.",478
1018,"It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of
his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,
made frequent use of his beach.",479
1019,"“Good morning, old sport.",480
1020,"You’re having lunch with me today and I
thought we’d ride up together.”",480
1021,"He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that
resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,
I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,
with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.",481
1022,"This quality
was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape
of restlessness.",481
1023,"He was never quite still; there was always a tapping
foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.",481
1024,He saw me looking with admiration at his car.,482
1025,"“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a better
view.",483
1026,“Haven’t you ever seen it before?”,483
1027,I’d seen it.,484
1028,Everybody had seen it.,484
1029,"It was a rich cream colour, bright
with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with
triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with
a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns.",484
1030,"Sitting down
behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,
we started to town.",484
1031,"I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and
found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say.",485
1032,"So my first
impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had
gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an
elaborate roadhouse next door.",485
1033,And then came that disconcerting ride.,486
1034,"We hadn’t reached West Egg
village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished
and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured
suit.",486
1035,"“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s your
opinion of me, anyhow?”",487
1036,"A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that
question deserves.",488
1037,"“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.",489
1038,"“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you
hear.”",489
1039,"So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation
in his halls.",490
1040,"“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine
retribution to stand by.",491
1041,"“I am the son of some wealthy people in the
Middle West—all dead now.",491
1042,"I was brought up in America but educated at
Oxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many
years.",491
1043,It is a family tradition.”,491
1044,"He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he
was lying.",492
1045,"He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed
it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.",492
1046,"And with
this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if
there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.",492
1047,“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.,493
1048,“San Francisco.”,494
1049,“I see.”,495
1050,“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”,496
1051,"His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a
clan still haunted him.",497
1052,"For a moment I suspected that he was pulling
my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.",497
1053,"“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of
Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting
big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to
forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”",498
1054,With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter.,499
1055,"The very
phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that
of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued
a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.",499
1056,"“Then came the war, old sport.",500
1057,"It was a great relief, and I tried very
hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life.",500
1058,"I accepted a
commission as first lieutenant when it began.",500
1059,"In the Argonne Forest I
took the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there
was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t
advance.",500
1060,"We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty
men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last
they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of
dead.",500
1061,"I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave
me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the
Adriatic Sea!”",500
1062,Little Montenegro!,501
1063,"He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his
smile.",501
1064,"The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and
sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people.",501
1065,"It
appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had
elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart.",501
1066,"My
incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming
hastily through a dozen magazines.",501
1067,"He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,
fell into my palm.",502
1068,“That’s the one from Montenegro.”,503
1069,"To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.",504
1070,"“Orderi di
Danilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”",504
1071,“Turn it.”,505
1072,"“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”",506
1073,“Here’s another thing I always carry.,507
1074,A souvenir of Oxford days.,507
1075,"It
was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of
Doncaster.”",507
1076,"It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an
archway through which were visible a host of spires.",508
1077,"There was Gatsby,
looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.",508
1078,Then it was all true.,509
1079,"I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace
on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with
their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.",509
1080,"“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing his
souvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know something
about me.",510
1081,I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody.,510
1082,"You see,
I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there
trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.",510
1083,“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”,510
1084,“At lunch?”,511
1085,"“No, this afternoon.",512
1086,"I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss
Baker to tea.”",512
1087,“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”,513
1088,"“No, old sport, I’m not.",514
1089,"But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak
to you about this matter.”",514
1090,"I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was more
annoyed than interested.",515
1091,"I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to
discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby.",515
1092,"I was sure the request would be something
utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon
his overpopulated lawn.",515
1093,He wouldn’t say another word.,516
1094,"His correctness grew on him as we neared
the city.",516
1095,"We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of
red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with
the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.",516
1096,"Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a
glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting
vitality as we went by.",516
1097,"With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half
Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated
I heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a frantic
policeman rode alongside.",517
1098,"“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby.",518
1099,We slowed down.,518
1100,"Taking a white
card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.",518
1101,"“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap.",519
1102,"“Know you next
time, Mr. Gatsby.",519
1103,Excuse me!”,519
1104,“What was that?” I inquired.,520
1105,“The picture of Oxford?”,520
1106,"“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a
Christmas card every year.”",521
1107,"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a
constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across
the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of
nonolfactory money.",522
1108,"The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always
the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the
mystery and the beauty in the world.",522
1109,"A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two
carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for
friends.",523
1110,"The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short
upper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of
Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday.",523
1111,"As we
crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white
chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl.",523
1112,"I
laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in
haughty rivalry.",523
1113,"“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;
“anything at all …”",524
1114,"Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.",525
1115,Roaring noon.,527
1116,"In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby
for lunch.",527
1117,"Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes
picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.",527
1118,“Mr.,528
1119,"Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”",528
1120,"A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two
fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril.",529
1121,"After a
moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.",529
1122,"“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand
earnestly, “and what do you think I did?”",530
1123,“What?” I inquired politely.,531
1124,"But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and
covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.",532
1125,"“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,
don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and
there.”",533
1126,"Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the
restaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was
starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.",534
1127,“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.,535
1128,"“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the
presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.",536
1129,"“But I like across the street
better!”",536
1130,"“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s too
hot over there.”",537
1131,"“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”",538
1132,“What place is that?” I asked.,539
1133,“The old Metropole.”,540
1134,"“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily.",541
1135,"“Filled with
faces dead and gone.",541
1136,Filled with friends gone now forever.,541
1137,"I can’t
forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.",541
1138,"It
was six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all
evening.",541
1139,"When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a
funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside.",541
1140,"‘All
right,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his
chair.",541
1141,"“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t
you, so help me, move outside this room.’",542
1142,"“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the
blinds we’d of seen daylight.”",543
1143,“Did he go?” I asked innocently.,544
1144,“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly.,545
1145,"“He
turned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take away
my coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three
times in his full belly and drove away.”",545
1146,"“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.",546
1147,"“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.",547
1148,“I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”,547
1149,The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling.,548
1150,"Gatsby answered
for me:",548
1151,"“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”",549
1152,“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.,550
1153,“This is just a friend.,551
1154,"I told you we’d talk about that some other
time.”",551
1155,"“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”",552
1156,"A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more
sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with
ferocious delicacy.",553
1157,"His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around
the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people
directly behind.",553
1158,"I think that, except for my presence, he would have
taken one short glance beneath our own table.",553
1159,"“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid I
made you a little angry this morning in the car.”",554
1160,"There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.",555
1161,"“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why you
won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want.",556
1162,"Why has it all got
to come through Miss Baker?”",556
1163,"“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me.",557
1164,"“Miss Baker’s a great
sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all
right.”",557
1165,"Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,
leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.",558
1166,"“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his
eyes.",559
1167,"“Fine fellow, isn’t he?",559
1168,"Handsome to look at and a perfect
gentleman.”",559
1169,“Yes.”,560
1170,“He’s an Oggsford man.”,561
1171,“Oh!”,562
1172,“He went to Oggsford College in England.,563
1173,You know Oggsford College?”,563
1174,“I’ve heard of it.”,564
1175,“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”,565
1176,“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.,566
1177,"“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way.",567
1178,"“I made the pleasure
of his acquaintance just after the war.",567
1179,"But I knew I had discovered a
man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.",567
1180,"I said to
myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce
to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused.",567
1181,"“I see you’re looking at my
cuff buttons.”",567
1182,"I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.",568
1183,"They were composed of
oddly familiar pieces of ivory.",568
1184,"“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.",569
1185,“Well!” I inspected them.,570
1186,“That’s a very interesting idea.”,570
1187,“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.,571
1188,"“Yeah, Gatsby’s very
careful about women.",571
1189,"He would never so much as look at a friend’s
wife.”",571
1190,"When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and
sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his
feet.",572
1191,"“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from you
two young men before I outstay my welcome.”",573
1192,"“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.",574
1193,"Mr. Wolfshiem
raised his hand in a sort of benediction.",574
1194,"“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced
solemnly.",575
1195,"“You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies
and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his
hand.",575
1196,"“As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on
you any longer.”",575
1197,As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.,576
1198,"I
wondered if I had said anything to offend him.",576
1199,"“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby.",577
1200,"“This is
one of his sentimental days.",577
1201,"He’s quite a character around New York—a
denizen of Broadway.”",577
1202,"“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”",578
1203,“No.”,579
1204,“A dentist?”,580
1205,“Meyer Wolfshiem?,581
1206,"No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,
coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”",581
1207,“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.,582
1208,The idea staggered me.,583
1209,"I remembered, of course, that the World’s
Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all I
would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of
some inevitable chain.",583
1210,"It never occurred to me that one man could
start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the
single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.",583
1211,“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.,584
1212,“He just saw the opportunity.”,585
1213,“Why isn’t he in jail?”,586
1214,"“They can’t get him, old sport.",587
1215,He’s a smart man.”,587
1216,I insisted on paying the check.,588
1217,"As the waiter brought my change I
caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.",588
1218,"“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello to
someone.”",589
1219,"When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our
direction.",590
1220,“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly.,591
1221,"“Daisy’s furious because you
haven’t called up.”",591
1222,"“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”",592
1223,"They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of
embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.",593
1224,"“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me.",594
1225,"“How’d you happen to
come up this far to eat?”",594
1226,“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”,595
1227,"I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.",596
1228,One October day in nineteen-seventeen—,598
1229,"(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a
straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)",599
1230,"—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks
and half on the lawns.",600
1231,"I was happier on the lawns because I had on
shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the
soft ground.",600
1232,"I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the
wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in
front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,
in a disapproving way.",600
1233,"The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to
Daisy Fay’s house.",601
1234,"She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and
by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.",601
1235,"She
dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long
the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp
Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that
night.",601
1236,"“Anyways, for an hour!”",601
1237,"When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was
beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had
never seen before.",602
1238,"They were so engrossed in each other that she
didn’t see me until I was five feet away.",602
1239,"“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly.",603
1240,“Please come here.”,603
1241,"I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the
older girls I admired her most.",604
1242,"She asked me if I was going to the Red
Cross to make bandages.",604
1243,I was.,604
1244,"Well, then, would I tell them that she
couldn’t come that day?",604
1245,"The officer looked at Daisy while she was
speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at
sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the
incident ever since.",604
1246,"His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on
him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I
didn’t realize it was the same man.",604
1247,That was nineteen-seventeen.,605
1248,"By the next year I had a few beaux
myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very
often.",605
1249,"She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone
at all.",605
1250,"Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had
found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say
goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas.",605
1251,"She was effectually
prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for
several weeks.",605
1252,"After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any
more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,
who couldn’t get into the army at all.",605
1253,"By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever.",606
1254,"She had a début
after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a
man from New Orleans.",606
1255,"In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,
with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before.",606
1256,"He
came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a
whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he
gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.",606
1257,I was a bridesmaid.,607
1258,"I came into her room half an hour before the
bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June
night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey.",607
1259,"She had a bottle
of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.",607
1260,"“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered.",608
1261,"“Never had a drink before, but oh how
I do enjoy it.”",608
1262,"“What’s the matter, Daisy?”",609
1263,"I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.",610
1264,"“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her
on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.",611
1265,"“Take ’em downstairs
and give ’em back to whoever they belong to.",611
1266,"Tell ’em all Daisy’s
change’ her mine.",611
1267,Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”,611
1268,She began to cry—she cried and cried.,612
1269,"I rushed out and found her
mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.",612
1270,She wouldn’t let go of the letter.,612
1271,"She took it into the tub with her
and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the
soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.",612
1272,But she didn’t say another word.,613
1273,"We gave her spirits of ammonia and
put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half
an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around
her neck and the incident was over.",613
1274,"Next day at five o’clock she
married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a
three months’ trip to the South Seas.",613
1275,"I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’d
never seen a girl so mad about her husband.",614
1276,"If he left the room for a
minute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” and
wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the
door.",614
1277,"She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the
hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with
unfathomable delight.",614
1278,"It was touching to see them together—it made you
laugh in a hushed, fascinated way.",614
1279,That was in August.,614
1280,"A week after I
left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,
and ripped a front wheel off his car.",614
1281,"The girl who was with him got
into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the
chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.",614
1282,"The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for
a year.",615
1283,"I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and
then they came back to Chicago to settle down.",615
1284,"Daisy was popular in
Chicago, as you know.",615
1285,"They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young
and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect
reputation.",615
1286,Perhaps because she doesn’t drink.,615
1287,"It’s a great advantage
not to drink among hard-drinking people.",615
1288,"You can hold your tongue and,
moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that
everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care.",615
1289,"Perhaps Daisy
never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice
of hers …",615
1290,"Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first
time in years.",616
1291,"It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew
Gatsby in West Egg.",616
1292,"After you had gone home she came into my room and
woke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I was
half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man
she used to know.",616
1293,"It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby
with the officer in her white car.",616
1294,"When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza
for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.",618
1295,"The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in
the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered
like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:",618
1296, “I’m the Sheik of Araby.,619
1297,Your love belongs to me.,619
1298,"At night when
 you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”",619
1299,"“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.",620
1300,“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”,621
1301,“Why not?”,622
1302,“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”,623
1303,"Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that
June night.",624
1304,"He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of
his purposeless splendour.",624
1305,"“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to your
house some afternoon and then let him come over.”",625
1306,The modesty of the demand shook me.,626
1307,"He had waited five years and
bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that
he could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.",626
1308,“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”,627
1309,"“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long.",628
1310,"He thought you might be
offended.",628
1311,"You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”",628
1312,Something worried me.,629
1313,“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”,630
1314,"“He wants her to see his house,” she explained.",631
1315,"“And your house is
right next door.”",631
1316,“Oh!”,632
1317,"“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some
night,” went on Jordan, “but she never did.",633
1318,"Then he began asking
people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.",633
1319,"It
was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard
the elaborate way he worked up to it.",633
1320,"Of course, I immediately
suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:",633
1321,“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying.,634
1322,"‘I
want to see her right next door.’",634
1323,"“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to
abandon the whole idea.",635
1324,"He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he
says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of
catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”",635
1325,"It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm
around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her
to dinner.",636
1326,"Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,
but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal
scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my
arm.",636
1327,"A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady
excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and
the tired.”",636
1328,"“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan to
me.",637
1329,“Does she want to see Gatsby?”,638
1330,“She’s not to know about it.,639
1331,Gatsby doesn’t want her to know.,639
1332,"You’re
just supposed to invite her to tea.”",639
1333,"We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth
Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.",640
1334,"Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face
floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up
the girl beside me, tightening my arms.",640
1335,"Her wan, scornful mouth
smiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.",640
1336,"
                                  V",641
1337,"When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that
my house was on fire.",642
1338,"Two o’clock and the whole corner of the
peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery
and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.",642
1339,"Turning a
corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.",642
1340,"At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved
itself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all the
house thrown open to the game.",643
1341,But there wasn’t a sound.,643
1342,"Only wind in
the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on
again as if the house had winked into the darkness.",643
1343,"As my taxi groaned
away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.",643
1344,"“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.",644
1345,“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently.,645
1346,"“I have been
glancing into some of the rooms.",645
1347,"Let’s go to Coney Island, old
sport.",645
1348,In my car.”,645
1349,“It’s too late.”,646
1350,"“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool?",647
1351,"I haven’t made
use of it all summer.”",647
1352,“I’ve got to go to bed.”,648
1353,“All right.”,649
1354,"He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.",650
1355,"“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment.",651
1356,"“I’m going to call
up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”",651
1357,"“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly.",652
1358,"“I don’t want to put you
to any trouble.”",652
1359,“What day would suit you?”,653
1360,“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly.,654
1361,"“I don’t want to
put you to any trouble, you see.”",654
1362,“How about the day after tomorrow?”,655
1363,He considered for a moment.,656
1364,"Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the
grass cut,” he said.",656
1365,"We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my
ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.",657
1366,"I
suspected that he meant my grass.",657
1367,"“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.",658
1368,“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.,659
1369,"“Oh, it isn’t about that.",660
1370,"At least—” He fumbled with a series of
beginnings.",660
1371,"“Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make
much money, do you?”",660
1372,“Not very much.”,661
1373,This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.,662
1374,"“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a
little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.",663
1375,"And
I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,
aren’t you, old sport?”",663
1376,“Trying to.”,664
1377,"“Well, this would interest you.",665
1378,"It wouldn’t take up much of your time
and you might pick up a nice bit of money.",665
1379,"It happens to be a rather
confidential sort of thing.”",665
1380,"I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation
might have been one of the crises of my life.",666
1381,"But, because the offer
was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no
choice except to cut him off there.",666
1382,"“I’ve got my hands full,” I said.",667
1383,"“I’m much obliged but I couldn’t
take on any more work.”",667
1384,"“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently he
thought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned at
lunch, but I assured him he was wrong.",668
1385,"He waited a moment longer,
hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be
responsive, so he went unwillingly home.",668
1386,"The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into a
deep sleep as I entered my front door.",669
1387,"So I don’t know whether or not
Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into
rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.",669
1388,"I called up Daisy from the
office next morning, and invited her to come to tea.",669
1389,"“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.",670
1390,“What?”,671
1391,“Don’t bring Tom.”,672
1392,“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.,673
1393,The day agreed upon was pouring rain.,674
1394,"At eleven o’clock a man in a
raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that
Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.",674
1395,"This reminded me that I
had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg
Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy
some cups and lemons and flowers.",674
1396,"The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived
from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.",675
1397,"An hour
later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel
suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.",675
1398,"He was pale,
and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.",675
1399,“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.,676
1400,"“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”",677
1401,“What grass?” he inquired blankly.,678
1402,"“Oh, the grass in the yard.” He
looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t
believe he saw a thing.",678
1403,"“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely.",679
1404,"“One of the papers said they
thought the rain would stop about four.",679
1405,"I think it was The
Journal.",679
1406,Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”,679
1407,"I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully at
the Finn.",680
1408,"Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the
delicatessen shop.",680
1409,“Will they do?” I asked.,681
1410,"“Of course, of course!",682
1411,"They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… old
sport.”",682
1412,"The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through which
occasional thin drops swam like dew.",683
1413,"Gatsby looked with vacant eyes
through a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread that
shook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows from
time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were
taking place outside.",683
1414,"Finally he got up and informed me, in an
uncertain voice, that he was going home.",683
1415,“Why’s that?”,684
1416,“Nobody’s coming to tea.,685
1417,"It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if
there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.",685
1418,"“I can’t wait
all day.”",685
1419,“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”,686
1420,"He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously
there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane.",687
1421,"We both jumped
up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.",687
1422,"Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the
drive.",688
1423,It stopped.,688
1424,"Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a
three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic
smile.",688
1425,"“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”",689
1426,The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.,690
1427,"I
had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear
alone, before any words came through.",690
1428,"A damp streak of hair lay like a
dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with
glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.",690
1429,"“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I have
to come alone?”",691
1430,“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent.,692
1431,"Tell your chauffeur to go far
away and spend an hour.”",692
1432,"“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name is
Ferdie.”",693
1433,“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”,694
1434,"“I don’t think so,” she said innocently.",695
1435,“Why?”,695
1436,We went in.,696
1437,To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.,696
1438,"“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.",697
1439,“What’s funny?”,698
1440,"She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the
front door.",699
1441,I went out and opened it.,699
1442,"Gatsby, pale as death, with his
hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a
puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.",699
1443,"With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the
hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the
living-room.",700
1444,It wasn’t a bit funny.,700
1445,"Aware of the loud beating of my
own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.",700
1446,For half a minute there wasn’t a sound.,701
1447,"Then from the living-room I
heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by
Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:",701
1448,“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”,702
1449,A pause; it endured horribly.,703
1450,"I had nothing to do in the hall, so I
went into the room.",703
1451,"Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the
mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of
boredom.",704
1452,"His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face
of a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraught
eyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,
on the edge of a stiff chair.",704
1453,"“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby.",705
1454,"His eyes glanced momentarily at
me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh.",705
1455,"Luckily
the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his
head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, and
set it back in place.",705
1456,"Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm
of the sofa and his chin in his hand.",705
1457,"“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.",706
1458,My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn.,707
1459,"I couldn’t muster up
a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.",707
1460,"“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.",708
1461,"I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on
the floor.",709
1462,"“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as
matter-of-fact as it could ever be.",710
1463,“Five years next November.”,711
1464,"The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least
another minute.",712
1465,"I had them both on their feet with the desperate
suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac
Finn brought it in on a tray.",712
1466,"Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical
decency established itself.",713
1467,"Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,
while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other
of us with tense, unhappy eyes.",713
1468,"However, as calmness wasn’t an end in
itself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my
feet.",713
1469,“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.,714
1470,“I’ll be back.”,715
1471,“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”,716
1472,"He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and
whispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.",717
1473,“What’s the matter?”,718
1474,"“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to
side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”",719
1475,"“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’s
embarrassed too.”",720
1476,“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.,721
1477,“Just as much as you are.”,722
1478,“Don’t talk so loud.”,723
1479,"“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently.",724
1480,"“Not only
that, but you’re rude.",724
1481,Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”,724
1482,"He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable
reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other
room.",725
1483,"I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his
nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge
black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the
rain.",726
1484,"Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by
Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric
marshes.",726
1485,"There was nothing to look at from under the tree except
Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church
steeple, for half an hour.",726
1486,"A brewer had built it early in the “period”
craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay
five years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would
have their roofs thatched with straw.",726
1487,"Perhaps their refusal took the
heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate
decline.",726
1488,"His children sold his house with the black wreath still on
the door.",726
1489,"Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have
always been obstinate about being peasantry.",726
1490,"After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobile
rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’
dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful.",727
1491,"A maid began opening
the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,
leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the
garden.",727
1492,It was time I went back.,727
1493,"While the rain continued it had
seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little
now and then with gusts of emotion.",727
1494,"But in the new silence I felt that
silence had fallen within the house too.",727
1495,"I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of
pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound.",728
1496,"They
were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if
some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of
embarrassment was gone.",728
1497,"Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when
I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief
before a mirror.",728
1498,"But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply
confounding.",728
1499,"He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of
exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little
room.",728
1500,"“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years.",729
1501,"I
thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.",729
1502,“It’s stopped raining.”,730
1503,"“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there were
twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,
like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to
Daisy.",731
1504,“What do you think of that?,731
1505,It’s stopped raining.”,731
1506,"“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told
only of her unexpected joy.",732
1507,"“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like to
show her around.”",733
1508,“You’re sure you want me to come?”,734
1509,"“Absolutely, old sport.”",735
1510,"Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with
humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.",736
1511,"“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded.",737
1512,"“See how the whole
front of it catches the light.”",737
1513,I agreed that it was splendid.,738
1514,"“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower.",739
1515,"“It
took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”",739
1516,“I thought you inherited your money.”,740
1517,"“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it in
the big panic—the panic of the war.”",741
1518,"I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what
business he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realized
that it wasn’t an appropriate reply.",742
1519,"“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself.",743
1520,"“I was in the
drug business and then I was in the oil business.",743
1521,"But I’m not in
either one now.” He looked at me with more attention.",743
1522,"“Do you mean
you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”",743
1523,"Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of
brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.",744
1524,“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.,745
1525,“Do you like it?”,746
1526,"“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”",747
1527,"“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day.",748
1528,"People
who do interesting things.",748
1529,Celebrated people.”,748
1530,"Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the
road and entered by the big postern.",749
1531,"With enchanting murmurs Daisy
admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,
admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy
odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of
kiss-me-at-the-gate.",749
1532,"It was strange to reach the marble steps and find
no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but
bird voices in the trees.",749
1533,"And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and
Restoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind
every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we
had passed through.",750
1534,"As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College
Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into
ghostly laughter.",750
1535,"We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender
silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,
and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a
dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.",751
1536,"It
was Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrily
about the beach that morning.",751
1537,"Finally we came to Gatsby’s own
apartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we sat
down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in
the wall.",751
1538,"He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued
everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew
from her well-loved eyes.",752
1539,"Sometimes too, he stared around at his
possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding
presence none of it was any longer real.",752
1540,"Once he nearly toppled down a
flight of stairs.",752
1541,"His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was
garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.",753
1542,"Daisy took the brush
with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and
shaded his eyes and began to laugh.",753
1543,"“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously.",754
1544,"“I
can’t—When I try to—”",754
1545,"He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a
third.",755
1546,"After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed
with wonder at her presence.",755
1547,"He had been full of the idea so long,
dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to
speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.",755
1548,"Now, in the reaction,
he was running down like an over-wound clock.",755
1549,"Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent
cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and
his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.",756
1550,“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes.,757
1551,"He sends over a
selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”",757
1552,"He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,
before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,
which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in
many-coloured disarray.",758
1553,"While we admired he brought more and the soft
rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in
coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of
indian blue.",758
1554,"Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into
the shirts and began to cry stormily.",758
1555,"“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the
thick folds.",759
1556,"“It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such
beautiful shirts before.”",759
1557,"After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and
the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window
it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated
surface of the Sound.",761
1558,"“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”
said Gatsby.",762
1559,"“You always have a green light that burns all night at
the end of your dock.”",762
1560,"Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in what
he had just said.",763
1561,"Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal
significance of that light had now vanished forever.",763
1562,"Compared to the
great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very
near to her, almost touching her.",763
1563,"It had seemed as close as a star to
the moon.",763
1564,Now it was again a green light on a dock.,763
1565,"His count of
enchanted objects had diminished by one.",763
1566,"I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects
in the half darkness.",764
1567,"A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting
costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.",764
1568,“Who’s this?”,765
1569,“That?,766
1570,"That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”",766
1571,The name sounded faintly familiar.,767
1572,“He’s dead now.,768
1573,He used to be my best friend years ago.”,768
1574,"There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the
bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently
when he was about eighteen.",769
1575,"“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy.",770
1576,“The pompadour!,770
1577,"You never told me you
had a pompadour—or a yacht.”",770
1578,"“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly.",771
1579,"“Here’s a lot of clippings—about
you.”",771
1580,They stood side by side examining it.,772
1581,"I was going to ask to see the
rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.",772
1582,"“Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said a
small town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use to
us if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”",773
1583,He rang off.,774
1584,“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.,775
1585,"The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,
and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.",776
1586,"“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to
just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you
around.”",777
1587,"I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence
made them feel more satisfactorily alone.",778
1588,"“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play the
piano.”",779
1589,"He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutes
accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with
shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair.",780
1590,"He was now decently
clothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and duck
trousers of a nebulous hue.",780
1591,“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.,781
1592,"“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.",782
1593,"“That is, I’d been asleep.",782
1594,Then I got up …”,782
1595,"“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off.",783
1596,"“Don’t
you, Ewing, old sport?”",783
1597,“I don’t play well.,784
1598,I don’t—hardly play at all.,784
1599,I’m all out of prac—”,784
1600,"“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby.",785
1601,He flipped a switch.,785
1602,"The
grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.",785
1603,In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.,786
1604,"He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her
on a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what the
gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.",786
1605,"When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the
bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.",787
1606,"“I’m all out of practice, you see.",788
1607,I told you I couldn’t play.,788
1608,"I’m all
out of prac—”",788
1609,"“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby.",789
1610,“Play!”,789
1611," “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”",790
1612,"Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along
the Sound.",791
1613,"All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric
trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New
York.",791
1614,"It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was
generating on the air.",791
1615," “One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the
 poor get—children.",792
1616,"In the meantime, In between time—”",792
1617,"As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of
bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt
had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.",793
1618,"Almost
five years!",793
1619,"There must have been moments even that afternoon when
Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but
because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.",793
1620,"It had gone beyond
her, beyond everything.",793
1621,"He had thrown himself into it with a creative
passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright
feather that drifted his way.",793
1622,"No amount of fire or freshness can
challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.",793
1623,"As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly.",794
1624,"His hand took
hold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turned
toward her with a rush of emotion.",794
1625,"I think that voice held him most,
with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be
over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.",794
1626,"They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;
Gatsby didn’t know me now at all.",795
1627,"I looked once more at them and they
looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.",795
1628,"Then I went
out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them
there together.",795
1629,"
                                  VI",796
1630,"About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one
morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.",797
1631,“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.,798
1632,“Why—any statement to give out.”,799
1633,"It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard
Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either
wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.",800
1634,"This was his day off and
with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”",800
1635,"It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.",801
1636,"Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his
hospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased all
summer until he fell just short of being news.",801
1637,"Contemporary legends
such as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves to
him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house
at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly
up and down the Long Island shore.",801
1638,"Just why these inventions were a
source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to
say.",801
1639,"James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.",802
1640,"He had
changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that
witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht
drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.",802
1641,"It was
James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a
torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay
Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and
informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an
hour.",802
1642,"I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then.",803
1643,"His
parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination
had never really accepted them as his parents at all.",803
1644,"The truth was
that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic
conception of himself.",803
1645,"He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means
anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,
the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty.",803
1646,"So he invented
just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.",803
1647,"For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of
Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other
capacity that brought him food and bed.",804
1648,"His brown, hardening body
lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing
days.",804
1649,"He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became
contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of
the others because they were hysterical about things which in his
overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.",804
1650,"But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.",805
1651,"The most grotesque
and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night.",805
1652,"A universe of
ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock
ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled
clothes upon the floor.",805
1653,"Each night he added to the pattern of his
fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an
oblivious embrace.",805
1654,"For a while these reveries provided an outlet for
his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of
reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on
a fairy’s wing.",805
1655,"An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,
to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota.",806
1656,"He
stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the
drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s
work with which he was to pay his way through.",806
1657,"Then he drifted back to
Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the
day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.",806
1658,"Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,
of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five.",807
1659,"The
transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire
found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,
suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him
from his money.",807
1660,"The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,
the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and
sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid
journalism in 1902.",807
1661,"He had been coasting along all too hospitable
shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in
Little Girl Bay.",807
1662,"To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,
that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world.",808
1663,"I
suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked
him when he smiled.",808
1664,"At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of
them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and
extravagantly ambitious.",808
1665,"A few days later he took him to Duluth and
bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a
yachting cap.",808
1666,"And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the
Barbary Coast, Gatsby left too.",808
1667,"He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with
Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even
jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk
might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by
reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.",809
1668,"The arrangement lasted five
years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.",809
1669,"It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye
came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody
inhospitably died.",809
1670,"I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid
man with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one
phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage
violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.",810
1671,"It was indirectly due to
Cody that Gatsby drank so little.",810
1672,"Sometimes in the course of gay
parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he
formed the habit of letting liquor alone.",810
1673,"And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five
thousand dollars.",811
1674,He didn’t get it.,811
1675,"He never understood the legal
device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions
went intact to Ella Kaye.",811
1676,"He was left with his singularly appropriate
education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the
substantiality of a man.",811
1677,"He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with
the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,
which weren’t even faintly true.",813
1678,"Moreover he told it to me at a time
of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and
nothing about him.",813
1679,"So I take advantage of this short halt, while
Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of
misconceptions away.",813
1680,"It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.",814
1681,"For several
weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in
New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself
with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday
afternoon.",814
1682,"I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom
Buchanan in for a drink.",814
1683,"I was startled, naturally, but the really
surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.",814
1684,"They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and
a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.",815
1685,"“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch.",816
1686,"“I’m
delighted that you dropped in.”",816
1687,As though they cared!,817
1688,“Sit right down.,818
1689,"Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the
room quickly, ringing bells.",818
1690,"“I’ll have something to drink for you in
just a minute.”",818
1691,He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there.,819
1692,"But he
would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in
a vague way that that was all they came for.",819
1693,"Mr. Sloane wanted
nothing.",819
1694,A lemonade?,819
1695,"No, thanks.",819
1696,A little champagne?,819
1697,"Nothing at all,
thanks … I’m sorry—",819
1698,“Did you have a nice ride?”,820
1699,“Very good roads around here.”,821
1700,“I suppose the automobiles—”,822
1701,“Yeah.”,823
1702,"Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had
accepted the introduction as a stranger.",824
1703,"“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”",825
1704,"“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.",826
1705,“So we did.,826
1706,I remember very well.”,826
1707,“About two weeks ago.”,827
1708,“That’s right.,828
1709,You were with Nick here.”,828
1710,"“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.",829
1711,“That so?”,830
1712,Tom turned to me.,831
1713,"“You live near here, Nick?”",832
1714,“Next door.”,833
1715,“That so?”,834
1716,"Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back
haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until
unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.",835
1717,"“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.",836
1718,“What do you say?”,836
1719,“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”,837
1720,"“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude.",838
1721,"“Well—think ought
to be starting home.”",838
1722,"“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them.",839
1723,"He had control of himself
now, and he wanted to see more of Tom.",839
1724,"“Why don’t you—why don’t you
stay for supper?",839
1725,"I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped
in from New York.”",839
1726,"“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically.",840
1727,"“Both of
you.”",840
1728,This included me.,841
1729,Mr. Sloane got to his feet.,841
1730,"“Come along,” he said—but to her only.",842
1731,"“I mean it,” she insisted.",843
1732,“I’d love to have you.,843
1733,Lots of room.”,843
1734,Gatsby looked at me questioningly.,844
1735,"He wanted to go and he didn’t see
that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.",844
1736,"“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.",845
1737,"“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.",846
1738,Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.,847
1739,"“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.",848
1740,"“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby.",849
1741,"“I used to ride in the army, but
I’ve never bought a horse.",849
1742,I’ll have to follow you in my car.,849
1743,"Excuse
me for just a minute.”",849
1744,"The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady
began an impassioned conversation aside.",850
1745,"“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom.",851
1746,"“Doesn’t he know she
doesn’t want him?”",851
1747,“She says she does want him.”,852
1748,"“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He
frowned.",853
1749,“I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy.,853
1750,"By God, I may be
old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to
suit me.",853
1751,They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”,853
1752,"Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted
their horses.",854
1753,"“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late.",855
1754,"We’ve got to go.”  And
then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”",855
1755,"Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they
trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage
just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the
front door.",856
1756,"Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on
the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s
party.",857
1757,"Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of
oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties
that summer.",857
1758,"There were the same people, or at least the same sort of
people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,
many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a
pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before.",857
1759,"Or perhaps I had
merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete
in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to
nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was
looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes.",857
1760,"It is invariably saddening
to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your
own powers of adjustment.",857
1761,"They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling
hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.",858
1762,"“These things excite me so,” she whispered.",859
1763,"“If you want to kiss me
any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad
to arrange it for you.",859
1764,Just mention my name.,859
1765,Or present a green card.,859
1766,I’m giving out green—”,859
1767,"“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.",860
1768,“I’m looking around.,861
1769,I’m having a marvellous—”,861
1770,“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”,862
1771,Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.,863
1772,"“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking
I don’t know a soul here.”",864
1773,"“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely
human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree.",865
1774,"Tom
and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies
the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.",865
1775,"“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.",866
1776,“The man bending over her is her director.”,867
1777,He took them ceremoniously from group to group:,868
1778,“Mrs.,869
1779,"Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he
added: “the polo player.”",869
1780,"“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”",870
1781,"But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the
polo player” for the rest of the evening.",871
1782,"“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed.",872
1783,"“I liked that
man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”",872
1784,"Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.",873
1785,"“Well, I liked him anyhow.”",874
1786,"“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,
“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”",875
1787,Daisy and Gatsby danced.,876
1788,"I remember being surprised by his graceful,
conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before.",876
1789,"Then they
sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,
while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden.",876
1790,"“In case
there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”",876
1791,"Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper
together.",877
1792,"“Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he
said.",877
1793,“A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”,877
1794,"“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any
addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a
moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that
except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t
having a good time.",878
1795,We were at a particularly tipsy table.,879
1796,"That was my fault—Gatsby had
been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two
weeks before.",879
1797,"But what had amused me then turned septic on the air
now.",879
1798,"“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”",880
1799,"The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my
shoulder.",881
1800,At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.,881
1801,“Wha’?”,882
1802,"A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf
with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:",883
1803,"“Oh, she’s all right now.",884
1804,"When she’s had five or six cocktails she
always starts screaming like that.",884
1805,"I tell her she ought to leave it
alone.”",884
1806,"“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.",885
1807,"“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody
that needs your help, Doc.’ ”",886
1808,"“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without
gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in
the pool.”",887
1809,"“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss
Baedeker.",888
1810,“They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”,888
1811,"“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.",889
1812,“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently.,890
1813,"“Your hand
shakes.",890
1814,I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”,890
1815,It was like that.,891
1816,"Almost the last thing I remember was standing with
Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star.",891
1817,"They were
still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except
for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.",891
1818,"It occurred to me that he
had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this
proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate
degree and kiss at her cheek.",891
1819,"“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”",892
1820,"But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture
but an emotion.",893
1821,"She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented
“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing
village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old
euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants
along a shortcut from nothing to nothing.",893
1822,"She saw something awful in
the very simplicity she failed to understand.",893
1823,I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.,894
1824,"It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet
of light volleying out into the soft black morning.",894
1825,"Sometimes a shadow
moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,
an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an
invisible glass.",894
1826,“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly.,895
1827,"“Some big
bootlegger?”",895
1828,“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.,896
1829,“I didn’t hear it.,897
1830,I imagined it.,897
1831,"A lot of these newly rich people are
just big bootleggers, you know.”",897
1832,"“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.",898
1833,He was silent for a moment.,899
1834,"The pebbles of the drive crunched under
his feet.",899
1835,"“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie
together.”",900
1836,A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.,901
1837,"“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said
with an effort.",902
1838,“You didn’t look so interested.”,903
1839,"“Well, I was.”",904
1840,Tom laughed and turned to me.,905
1841,"“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under
a cold shower?”",906
1842,"Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,
bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and
would never have again.",907
1843,"When the melody rose her voice broke up
sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change
tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.",907
1844,"“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said
suddenly.",908
1845,“That girl hadn’t been invited.,908
1846,"They simply force their way
in and he’s too polite to object.”",908
1847,"“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom.",909
1848,"“And I
think I’ll make a point of finding out.”",909
1849,"“I can tell you right now,” she answered.",910
1850,"“He owned some drugstores, a
lot of drugstores.",910
1851,He built them up himself.”,910
1852,The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.,911
1853,"“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.",912
1854,"Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where
“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,
was drifting out the open door.",913
1855,"After all, in the very casualness of
Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from
her world.",913
1856,"What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling
her back inside?",913
1857,"What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?",913
1858,"Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare
and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with
one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would
blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.",913
1859,I stayed late that night.,914
1860,"Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,
and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had
run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights
were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead.",914
1861,"When he came down the
steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,
and his eyes were bright and tired.",914
1862,"“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.",915
1863,“Of course she did.”,916
1864,"“She didn’t like it,” he insisted.",917
1865,“She didn’t have a good time.”,917
1866,"He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.",918
1867,"“I feel far away from her,” he said.",919
1868,"“It’s hard to make her
understand.”",919
1869,“You mean about the dance?”,920
1870,"“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of
his fingers.",921
1871,"“Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”",921
1872,"He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and
say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with
that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be
taken.",922
1873,"One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back
to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five
years ago.",922
1874,"“And she doesn’t understand,” he said.",923
1875,"“She used to be able to
understand.",923
1876,We’d sit for hours—”,923
1877,"He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit
rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.",924
1878,"“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured.",925
1879,"“You can’t repeat the
past.”",925
1880,“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously.,926
1881,"“Why of course you
can!”",926
1882,"He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the
shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.",927
1883,"“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,
nodding determinedly.",928
1884,“She’ll see.”,928
1885,"He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to
recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into
loving Daisy.",929
1886,"His life had been confused and disordered since then,
but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it
all slowly, he could find out what that thing was …",929
1887,"… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the
street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where
there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.",930
1888,"They
stopped here and turned toward each other.",930
1889,"Now it was a cool night
with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes
of the year.",930
1890,"The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the
darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars.",930
1891,"Out of the
corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really
formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could
climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the
pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.",930
1892,His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own.,931
1893,"He
knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable
visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like
the mind of God.",931
1894,"So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the
tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.",931
1895,Then he kissed her.,931
1896,"At
his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the
incarnation was complete.",931
1897,"Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was
reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,
that I had heard somewhere a long time ago.",932
1898,"For a moment a phrase
tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,
as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled
air.",932
1899,"But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was
uncommunicable forever.",932
1900,"
                                 VII",933
1901,"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights
in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as
it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.",934
1902,"Only gradually did I
become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his
drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.",934
1903,"Wondering
if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a
villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.",934
1904,“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”,935
1905,"“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.",936
1906,"“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried.",937
1907,"Tell him Mr.
Carraway came over.”",937
1908,“Who?” he demanded rudely.,938
1909,“Carraway.”,939
1910,“Carraway.,940
1911,"All right, I’ll tell him.”",940
1912,Abruptly he slammed the door.,941
1913,"My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his
house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never
went into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered
moderate supplies over the telephone.",942
1914,"The grocery boy reported that
the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the
village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.",942
1915,Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.,943
1916,“Going away?” I inquired.,944
1917,"“No, old sport.”",945
1918,“I hear you fired all your servants.”,946
1919,“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip.,947
1920,"Daisy comes over quite
often—in the afternoons.”",947
1921,"So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the
disapproval in her eyes.",948
1922,“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.,949
1923,"They’re all
brothers and sisters.",949
1924,They used to run a small hotel.”,949
1925,“I see.”,950
1926,"He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her
house tomorrow?",951
1927,Miss Baker would be there.,951
1928,"Half an hour later Daisy
herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was
coming.",951
1929,Something was up.,951
1930,"And yet I couldn’t believe that they would
choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing
scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.",951
1931,"The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of
the summer.",952
1932,"As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only
the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering
hush at noon.",952
1933,"The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of
combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into
her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her
fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.",952
1934,"Her
pocketbook slapped to the floor.",952
1935,"“Oh, my!” she gasped.",953
1936,"I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it
at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that
I had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,
suspected me just the same.",954
1937,“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces.,955
1938,“Some weather!,955
1939,… Hot!,955
1940,"…
Hot!",955
1941,… Hot!,955
1942,… Is it hot enough for you?,955
1943,Is it hot?,955
1944,Is it … ?”,955
1945,My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.,956
1946,"That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,
whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!",956
1947,"… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying
the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at
the door.",957
1948,“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece.,958
1949,"“I’m
sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this
noon!”",958
1950,What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”,959
1951,"He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to
take our stiff straw hats.",960
1952,"“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating the
direction.",961
1953,"In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the
common store of life.",961
1954,"The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.",962
1955,"Daisy and
Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down
their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.",962
1956,"“We can’t move,” they said together.",963
1957,"Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment
in mine.",964
1958,"“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.",965
1959,"Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall
telephone.",966
1960,"Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with
fascinated eyes.",967
1961,"Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting
laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.",967
1962,"“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on the
telephone.”",968
1963,We were silent.,969
1964,"The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very
well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligations
to you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I
won’t stand that at all!”",969
1965,"“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.",970
1966,"“No, he’s not,” I assured her.",971
1967,“It’s a bona-fide deal.,971
1968,"I happen to
know about it.”",971
1969,"Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his
thick body, and hurried into the room.",972
1970,“Mr.,973
1971,"Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed
dislike.",973
1972,"“I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”",973
1973,"“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.",974
1974,"As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and
pulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.",975
1975,"“You know I love you,” she murmured.",976
1976,"“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.",977
1977,Daisy looked around doubtfully.,978
1978,“You kiss Nick too.”,979
1979,"“What a low, vulgar girl!”",980
1980,"“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.",981
1981,"Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just
as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.",981
1982,"“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms.",982
1983,"“Come to your
own mother that loves you.”",982
1984,"The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and
rooted shyly into her mother’s dress.",983
1985,“The bles-sed pre-cious!,984
1986,"Did mother get powder on your old yellowy
hair?",984
1987,"Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”",984
1988,Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.,985
1989,Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise.,985
1990,"I don’t think he
had ever really believed in its existence before.",985
1991,"“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly to
Daisy.",986
1992,"“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent
into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.",987
1993,"“You dream, you.",987
1994,"You
absolute little dream.”",987
1995,"“Yes,” admitted the child calmly.",988
1996,"“Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress
too.”",988
1997,"“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so that
she faced Gatsby.",989
1998,“Do you think they’re pretty?”,989
1999,“Where’s Daddy?”,990
2000,"“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy.",991
2001,"“She looks like
me.",991
2002,She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”,991
2003,Daisy sat back upon the couch.,992
2004,"The nurse took a step forward and held
out her hand.",992
2005,"“Come, Pammy.”",993
2006,"“Goodbye, sweetheart!”",994
2007,"With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to
her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,
preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.",995
2008,Gatsby took up his drink.,996
2009,"“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.",997
2010,"We drank in long, greedy swallows.",998
2011,"“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tom
genially.",999
2012,"“It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into
the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting
colder every year.",999
2013,"“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a look
at the place.”",1000
2014,I went with them out to the veranda.,1001
2015,"On the green Sound, stagnant in
the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.",1001
2016,"Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed
across the bay.",1001
2017,“I’m right across from you.”,1002
2018,“So you are.”,1003
2019,"Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy
refuse of the dog-days alongshore.",1004
2020,"Slowly the white wings of the boat
moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.",1004
2021,"Ahead lay the scalloped
ocean and the abounding blessed isles.",1004
2022,"“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding.",1005
2023,"“I’d like to be out there
with him for about an hour.”",1005
2024,"We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and
drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.",1006
2025,"“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and the
day after that, and the next thirty years?”",1007
2026,"“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said.",1008
2027,"“Life starts all over again when it
gets crisp in the fall.”",1008
2028,"“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “and
everything’s so confused.",1009
2029,Let’s all go to town!”,1009
2030,"Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding
its senselessness into forms.",1010
2031,"“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to
Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a
garage.”",1011
2032,“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently.,1012
2033,"Gatsby’s eyes
floated toward her.",1012
2034,"“Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”",1012
2035,"Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in
space.",1013
2036,With an effort she glanced down at the table.,1013
2037,"“You always look so cool,” she repeated.",1014
2038,"She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.",1015
2039,"He was
astounded.",1015
2040,"His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and
then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew
a long time ago.",1015
2041,"“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.",1016
2042,“You know the advertisement of the man—”,1016
2043,"“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go to
town.",1017
2044,Come on—we’re all going to town.”,1017
2045,"He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.",1018
2046,"No one
moved.",1018
2047,“Come on!” His temper cracked a little.,1019
2048,"“What’s the matter, anyhow?",1019
2049,"If we’re going to town, let’s start.”",1019
2050,"His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips
the last of his glass of ale.",1020
2051,"Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out
on to the blazing gravel drive.",1020
2052,“Are we just going to go?” she objected.,1021
2053,“Like this?,1021
2054,"Aren’t we going
to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”",1021
2055,“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”,1022
2056,"“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him.",1023
2057,“It’s too hot to fuss.”,1023
2058,He didn’t answer.,1024
2059,"“Have it your own way,” she said.",1025
2060,"“Come on, Jordan.”",1025
2061,"They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there
shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.",1026
2062,"A silver curve of the moon
hovered already in the western sky.",1026
2063,"Gatsby started to speak, changed
his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.",1026
2064,“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.,1027
2065,“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”,1028
2066,“Oh.”,1029
2067,A pause.,1030
2068,"“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.",1031
2069,“Women get these notions in their heads—”,1031
2070,“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.,1032
2071,"“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom.",1033
2072,He went inside.,1033
2073,Gatsby turned to me rigidly:,1034
2074,"“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”",1035
2075,"“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked.",1036
2076,"“It’s full of—” I
hesitated.",1036
2077,"“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.",1037
2078,That was it.,1038
2079,I’d never understood before.,1038
2080,"It was full of money—that
was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of
it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s
daughter, the golden girl …",1038
2081,"Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed
by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and
carrying light capes over their arms.",1039
2082,“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby.,1040
2083,"He felt the hot, green
leather of the seat.",1040
2084,“I ought to have left it in the shade.”,1040
2085,“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.,1041
2086,“Yes.”,1042
2087,"“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”",1043
2088,The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.,1044
2089,"“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.",1045
2090,"“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously.",1046
2091,He looked at the gauge.,1046
2092,"“And
if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore.",1046
2093,"You can buy anything at a
drugstore nowadays.”",1046
2094,A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.,1047
2095,"Daisy looked at Tom
frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar
and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in
words, passed over Gatsby’s face.",1047
2096,"“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s
car.",1048
2097,“I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”,1048
2098,"He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.",1049
2099,“You take Nick and Jordan.,1050
2100,We’ll follow you in the coupé.”,1050
2101,"She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.",1051
2102,"Jordan
and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the
unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive
heat, leaving them out of sight behind.",1051
2103,“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.,1052
2104,“See what?”,1053
2105,"He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known
all along.",1054
2106,"“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested.",1055
2107,"“Perhaps I am,
but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to
do.",1055
2108,"Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”",1055
2109,He paused.,1056
2110,"The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back
from the edge of theoretical abyss.",1056
2111,"“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued.",1057
2112,"“I
could have gone deeper if I’d known—”",1057
2113,“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.,1058
2114,"“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed.",1059
2115,“A medium?”,1059
2116,“About Gatsby.”,1060
2117,“About Gatsby!,1061
2118,"No, I haven’t.",1061
2119,"I said I’d been making a small
investigation of his past.”",1061
2120,"“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.",1062
2121,“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous.,1063
2122,“Like hell he is!,1063
2123,"He wears a pink
suit.”",1063
2124,“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”,1064
2125,"“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something like
that.”",1065
2126,"“Listen, Tom.",1066
2127,"If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”
demanded Jordan crossly.",1066
2128,"“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows
where!”",1067
2129,"We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we
drove for a while in silence.",1068
2130,"Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded
eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution
about gasoline.",1068
2131,"“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.",1069
2132,"“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan.",1070
2133,"“I don’t want to
get stalled in this baking heat.”",1070
2134,"Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty
stop under Wilson’s sign.",1071
2135,"After a moment the proprietor emerged from
the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.",1071
2136,“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly.,1072
2137,"“What do you think we
stopped for—to admire the view?”",1072
2138,"“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving.",1073
2139,“Been sick all day.”,1073
2140,“What’s the matter?”,1074
2141,“I’m all run down.”,1075
2142,"“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded.",1076
2143,"“You sounded well enough on
the phone.”",1076
2144,"With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,
breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank.",1077
2145,"In the sunlight his
face was green.",1077
2146,"“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said.",1078
2147,"“But I need money
pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your
old car.”",1078
2148,“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom.,1079
2149,“I bought it last week.”,1079
2150,"“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.",1080
2151,“Like to buy it?”,1081
2152,"“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly.",1082
2153,"“No, but I could make some money
on the other.”",1082
2154,"“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”",1083
2155,“I’ve been here too long.,1084
2156,I want to get away.,1084
2157,"My wife and I want to go
West.”",1084
2158,"“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.",1085
2159,"“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment
against the pump, shading his eyes.",1086
2160,"“And now she’s going whether she
wants to or not.",1086
2161,I’m going to get her away.”,1086
2162,"The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a
waving hand.",1087
2163,“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.,1088
2164,"“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarked
Wilson.",1089
2165,“That’s why I want to get away.,1089
2166,"That’s why I been bothering
you about the car.”",1089
2167,“What do I owe you?”,1090
2168,“Dollar twenty.”,1091
2169,"The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a
bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t
alighted on Tom.",1092
2170,"He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life
apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically
sick.",1092
2171,"I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel
discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there
was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as
the difference between the sick and the well.",1092
2172,"Wilson was so sick that
he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor
girl with child.",1092
2173,"“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom.",1093
2174,"“I’ll send it over tomorrow
afternoon.”",1093
2175,"That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare
of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of
something behind.",1094
2176,"Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.
Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that
other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than
twenty feet away.",1094
2177,"In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved
aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.",1095
2178,"So
engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and
one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a
slowly developing picture.",1095
2179,"Her expression was curiously familiar—it
was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on Myrtle
Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized
that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on
Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.",1095
2180,"There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we
drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.",1097
2181,"His wife and his
mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping
precipitately from his control.",1097
2182,"Instinct made him step on the
accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving
Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an
hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in
sight of the easygoing blue coupé.",1097
2183,"“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested
Jordan.",1098
2184,“I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.,1098
2185,"There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of
funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”",1098
2186,"The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but
before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy
signalled us to draw up alongside.",1099
2187,“Where are we going?” she cried.,1100
2188,“How about the movies?”,1101
2189,"“It’s so hot,” she complained.",1102
2190,“You go.,1102
2191,"We’ll ride around and meet you
after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly.",1102
2192,"“We’ll meet you on some
corner.",1102
2193,I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”,1102
2194,"“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave
out a cursing whistle behind us.",1103
2195,"“You follow me to the south side of
Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”",1103
2196,"Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if
the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.",1104
2197,"I
think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his
life forever.",1104
2198,But they didn’t.,1105
2199,"And we all took the less explicable step of engaging
the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.",1105
2200,"The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into
that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in
the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around
my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.",1106
2201,"The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five
bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as
“a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it
was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and
thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …",1106
2202,"The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four
o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery
from the Park.",1107
2203,"Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,
fixing her hair.",1107
2204,"“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone
laughed.",1108
2205,"“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.",1109
2206,“There aren’t any more.”,1110
2207,"“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”",1111
2208,"“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.",1112
2209,“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”,1112
2210,"He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the
table.",1113
2211,"“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby.",1114
2212,"“You’re the one
that wanted to come to town.”",1114
2213,There was a moment of silence.,1115
2214,"The telephone book slipped from its
nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse
me”—but this time no one laughed.",1115
2215,"“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.",1116
2216,"“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in
an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.",1117
2217,"“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.",1118
2218,“What is?”,1119
2219,“All this ‘old sport’ business.,1120
2220,Where’d you pick that up?”,1120
2221,"“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if
you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.",1121
2222,Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”,1121
2223,"As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound
and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s
Wedding March from the ballroom below.",1122
2224,“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.,1123
2225,"“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.",1124
2226,“Louisville in June!,1124
2227,Somebody fainted.,1124
2228,"Who was it fainted, Tom?”",1124
2229,"“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.",1125
2230,“A man named Biloxi.,1126
2231,"‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a
fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”",1126
2232,"“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived
just two doors from the church.",1127
2233,"And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy
told him he had to get out.",1127
2234,"The day after he left Daddy died.”  After
a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “There
wasn’t any connection.”",1127
2235,"“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.",1128
2236,“That was his cousin.,1129
2237,"I knew his whole family history before he
left.",1129
2238,He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”,1129
2239,"The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer
floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of
“Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.",1130
2240,"“We’re getting old,” said Daisy.",1131
2241,"“If we were young we’d rise and
dance.”",1131
2242,"“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.",1132
2243,"“Where’d you know him, Tom?”",1132
2244,“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort.,1133
2245,“I didn’t know him.,1133
2246,"He was a
friend of Daisy’s.”",1133
2247,"“He was not,” she denied.",1134
2248,“I’d never seen him before.,1134
2249,"He came down in
the private car.”",1134
2250,"“Well, he said he knew you.",1135
2251,He said he was raised in Louisville.,1135
2252,"Asa
Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room
for him.”",1135
2253,Jordan smiled.,1136
2254,“He was probably bumming his way home.,1137
2255,"He told me he was president of
your class at Yale.”",1137
2256,Tom and I looked at each other blankly.,1138
2257,“Biloxi?”,1139
2258,"“First place, we didn’t have any president—”",1140
2259,"Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.",1141
2260,"“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”",1142
2261,“Not exactly.”,1143
2262,"“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”",1144
2263,“Yes—I went there.”,1145
2264,A pause.,1146
2265,"Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:",1146
2266,“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”,1147
2267,Another pause.,1148
2268,"A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice
but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing
of the door.",1148
2269,This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.,1148
2270,"“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.",1149
2271,"“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”",1150
2272,"“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months.",1151
2273,"That’s why I
can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”",1151
2274,Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.,1152
2275,"But we were all
looking at Gatsby.",1152
2276,"“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the
armistice,” he continued.",1153
2277,"“We could go to any of the universities in
England or France.”",1153
2278,I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.,1154
2279,"I had one of those
renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.",1154
2280,"Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.",1155
2281,"“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.",1156
2282,Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”,1156
2283,"“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more
question.”",1157
2284,"“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.",1158
2285,“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”,1159
2286,They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.,1160
2287,"“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the
other.",1161
2288,“You’re causing a row.,1161
2289,Please have a little self-control.”,1161
2290,“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously.,1162
2291,"“I suppose the latest
thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your
wife.",1162
2292,"Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people
begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next
they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between
black and white.”",1162
2293,"Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone
on the last barrier of civilization.",1163
2294,"“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.",1164
2295,“I know I’m not very popular.,1165
2296,I don’t give big parties.,1165
2297,"I suppose
you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any
friends—in the modern world.”",1165
2298,"Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he
opened his mouth.",1166
2299,"The transition from libertine to prig was so
complete.",1166
2300,"“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby.",1167
2301,"But Daisy
guessed at his intention.",1167
2302,“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly.,1168
2303,"“Please let’s all go
home.",1168
2304,Why don’t we all go home?”,1168
2305,"“That’s a good idea,” I got up.",1169
2306,"“Come on, Tom.",1169
2307,Nobody wants a drink.”,1169
2308,“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”,1170
2309,"“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby.",1171
2310,“She’s never loved you.,1171
2311,She loves me.”,1171
2312,“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.,1172
2313,"Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.",1173
2314,"“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried.",1174
2315,"“She only married you
because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me.",1174
2316,"It was a
terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”",1174
2317,"At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted
with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had
anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously
of their emotions.",1175
2318,"“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal
note.",1176
2319,“What’s been going on?,1176
2320,I want to hear all about it.”,1176
2321,"“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby.",1177
2322,"“Going on for five
years—and you didn’t know.”",1177
2323,Tom turned to Daisy sharply.,1178
2324,“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”,1179
2325,"“Not seeing,” said Gatsby.",1180
2326,"“No, we couldn’t meet.",1180
2327,"But both of us loved
each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know.",1180
2328,"I used to
laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that
you didn’t know.”",1180
2329,"“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a
clergyman and leaned back in his chair.",1181
2330,“You’re crazy!” he exploded.,1182
2331,"“I can’t speak about what happened five
years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I
see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries
to the back door.",1182
2332,But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie.,1182
2333,"Daisy
loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”",1182
2334,"“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.",1183
2335,"“She does, though.",1184
2336,"The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish
ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded
sagely.",1184
2337,"“And what’s more, I love Daisy too.",1184
2338,"Once in a while I go off
on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in
my heart I love her all the time.”",1184
2339,"“You’re revolting,” said Daisy.",1185
2340,"She turned to me, and her voice,
dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do
you know why we left Chicago?",1185
2341,"I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you
to the story of that little spree.”",1185
2342,Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.,1186
2343,"“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly.",1187
2344,"“It doesn’t matter
any more.",1187
2345,"Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s
all wiped out forever.”",1187
2346,She looked at him blindly.,1188
2347,“Why—how could I love him—possibly?”,1188
2348,“You never loved him.”,1189
2349,She hesitated.,1190
2350,"Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,
as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she
had never, all along, intended doing anything at all.",1190
2351,"But it was done
now.",1190
2352,It was too late.,1190
2353,"“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.",1191
2354,“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.,1192
2355,“No.”,1193
2356,"From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were
drifting up on hot waves of air.",1194
2357,"“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your
shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”",1195
2358,"“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.",1196
2359,She looked at Gatsby.,1196
2360,"“There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried
to light a cigarette was trembling.",1196
2361,"Suddenly she threw the cigarette
and the burning match on the carpet.",1196
2362,"“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby.",1197
2363,"“I love you now—isn’t
that enough?",1197
2364,"I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sob
helplessly.",1197
2365,“I did love him once—but I loved you too.”,1197
2366,Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.,1198
2367,“You loved me too?” he repeated.,1199
2368,"“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely.",1200
2369,"“She didn’t know you were
alive.",1200
2370,"Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,
things that neither of us can ever forget.”",1200
2371,The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.,1201
2372,"“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted.",1202
2373,"“She’s all excited
now—”",1202
2374,"“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful
voice.",1203
2375,“It wouldn’t be true.”,1203
2376,"“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.",1204
2377,She turned to her husband.,1205
2378,"“As if it mattered to you,” she said.",1206
2379,“Of course it matters.,1207
2380,"I’m going to take better care of you from now
on.”",1207
2381,"“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic.",1208
2382,"“You’re
not going to take care of her any more.”",1208
2383,“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed.,1209
2384,"He could afford to
control himself now.",1209
2385,“Why’s that?”,1209
2386,“Daisy’s leaving you.”,1210
2387,“Nonsense.”,1211
2388,"“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.",1212
2389,“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.,1213
2390,"“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he
put on her finger.”",1213
2391,“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy.,1214
2392,"“Oh, please let’s get out.”",1214
2393,"“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom.",1215
2394,"“You’re one of that bunch that
hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know.",1215
2395,"I’ve
made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it
further tomorrow.”",1215
2396,"“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.",1216
2397,"“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke
rapidly.",1217
2398,"“He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street
drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the
counter.",1217
2399,That’s one of his little stunts.,1217
2400,"I picked him for a
bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”",1217
2401,“What about it?” said Gatsby politely.,1218
2402,"“I guess your friend Walter
Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”",1218
2403,"“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you?",1219
2404,"You let him go to jail for
a month over in New Jersey.",1219
2405,God!,1219
2406,"You ought to hear Walter on the
subject of you.”",1219
2407,“He came to us dead broke.,1220
2408,"He was very glad to pick up some money, old
sport.”",1220
2409,“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom.,1221
2410,"Gatsby said
nothing.",1221
2411,"“Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but
Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”",1221
2412,That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.,1222
2413,"“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,
“but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me
about.”",1223
2414,"I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her
husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but
absorbing object on the tip of her chin.",1224
2415,"Then I turned back to
Gatsby—and was startled at his expression.",1224
2416,"He looked—and this is said
in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had
“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in
just that fantastic way.",1224
2417,"It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying
everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been
made.",1225
2418,"But with every word she was drawing further and further into
herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the
afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,
struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across
the room.",1225
2419,The voice begged again to go.,1226
2420,"“Please, Tom!",1227
2421,I can’t stand this any more.”,1227
2422,"Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage
she had had, were definitely gone.",1228
2423,"“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom.",1229
2424,“In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”,1229
2425,"She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous
scorn.",1230
2426,“Go on.,1231
2427,He won’t annoy you.,1231
2428,"I think he realizes that his presumptuous
little flirtation is over.”",1231
2429,"They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,
isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.",1232
2430,"After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of
whisky in the towel.",1233
2431,“Want any of this stuff?,1234
2432,Jordan?,1234
2433,… Nick?”,1234
2434,I didn’t answer.,1235
2435,“Nick?” He asked again.,1236
2436,“What?”,1237
2437,“Want any?”,1238
2438,“No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”,1239
2439,I was thirty.,1240
2440,"Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a
new decade.",1240
2441,"It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started
for Long Island.",1241
2442,"Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but
his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on
the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead.",1241
2443,"Human sympathy
has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments
fade with the city lights behind.",1241
2444,"Thirty—the promise of a decade of
loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning
briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair.",1241
2445,"But there was Jordan beside
me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten
dreams from age to age.",1241
2446,"As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face
fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of
thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.",1241
2447,So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.,1242
2448,"The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the
ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest.",1244
2449,"He had slept
through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the
garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale
as his own pale hair and shaking all over.",1244
2450,"Michaelis advised him to go
to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if
he did.",1244
2451,"While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent
racket broke out overhead.",1244
2452,"“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.",1245
2453,"“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re
going to move away.”",1245
2454,"Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and
Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.",1246
2455,"Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he
sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars
that passed along the road.",1246
2456,"When anyone spoke to him he invariably
laughed in an agreeable, colourless way.",1246
2457,"He was his wife’s man and not
his own.",1246
2458,"So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson
wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious
glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain
times on certain days.",1247
2459,"Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some
workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis
took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.",1247
2460,"But he
didn’t.",1247
2461,"He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.",1247
2462,"When he came outside
again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation
because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in
the garage.",1247
2463,“Beat me!” he heard her cry.,1248
2464,"“Throw me down and beat me, you dirty
little coward!”",1248
2465,"A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and
shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.",1249
2466,"The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out
of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then
disappeared around the next bend.",1250
2467,"Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of
its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green.",1250
2468,"The
other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards
beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life
violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark
blood with the dust.",1250
2469,"Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open
her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left
breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen
for the heart beneath.",1251
2470,"The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at
the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the
tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",1251
2471,"We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still
some distance away.",1253
2472,“Wreck!” said Tom.,1254
2473,“That’s good.,1254
2474,"Wilson’ll have a little business at
last.”",1254
2475,"He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as
we came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage
door made him automatically put on the brakes.",1255
2476,"“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”",1256
2477,"I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly
from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked
toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered
over and over in a gasping moan.",1257
2478,"“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.",1258
2479,"He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the
garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal
basket overhead.",1259
2480,"Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a
violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way
through.",1259
2481,"The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it
was a minute before I could see anything at all.",1260
2482,"Then new arrivals
deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.",1260
2483,"Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another
blanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on
a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending
over it, motionless.",1261
2484,"Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking
down names with much sweat and correction in a little book.",1261
2485,"At first I
couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed
clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the
raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to
the doorposts with both hands.",1261
2486,"Some man was talking to him in a low
voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his
shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.",1261
2487,"His eyes would drop slowly
from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk
back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,
horrible call:",1261
2488,"“Oh, my Ga-od!",1262
2489,"Oh, my Ga-od!",1262
2490,"Oh, Ga-od!",1262
2491,"Oh, my Ga-od!”",1262
2492,"Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around
the garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to
the policeman.",1263
2493,"“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”",1264
2494,"“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”",1265
2495,“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.,1266
2496,"“r—” said the policeman, “o—”",1267
2497,“g—”,1268
2498,“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.,1269
2499,"“What you want, fella?”",1269
2500,“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”,1270
2501,“Auto hit her.,1271
2502,Ins’antly killed.”,1271
2503,"“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.",1272
2504,“She ran out ina road.,1273
2505,Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”,1273
2506,"“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”",1274
2507,“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.,1275
2508,“One goin’ each way.,1276
2509,"Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets but
stopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the one
comin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty miles
an hour.”",1276
2510,“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.,1277
2511,“Hasn’t got any name.”,1278
2512,A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.,1279
2513,"“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car.",1280
2514,New.”,1280
2515,“See the accident?” asked the policeman.,1281
2516,"“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty.",1282
2517,"Going
fifty, sixty.”",1282
2518,“Come here and let’s have your name.,1283
2519,Look out now.,1283
2520,"I want to get his
name.”",1283
2521,"Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in
the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his
grasping cries:",1284
2522,“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was!,1285
2523,"I know what kind
of car it was!”",1285
2524,"Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten
under his coat.",1286
2525,"He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in
front of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.",1286
2526,"“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing
gruffness.",1287
2527,"Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then
would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.",1288
2528,"“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little.",1289
2529,"“I just got here a minute
ago, from New York.",1289
2530,"I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking
about.",1289
2531,"That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you
hear?",1289
2532,I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”,1289
2533,"Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the
policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent
eyes.",1290
2534,“What’s all that?” he demanded.,1291
2535,"“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on
Wilson’s body.",1292
2536,"“He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow
car.”",1292
2537,Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.,1293
2538,“And what colour’s your car?”,1294
2539,"“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”",1295
2540,"“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.",1296
2541,"Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and
the policeman turned away.",1297
2542,"“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”",1298
2543,"Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set
him down in a chair, and came back.",1299
2544,"“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped
authoritatively.",1300
2545,"He watched while the two men standing closest glanced
at each other and went unwillingly into the room.",1300
2546,"Then Tom shut the
door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the
table.",1300
2547,As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”,1300
2548,"Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we
pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,
case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.",1301
2549,"Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down
hard, and the coupé raced along through the night.",1302
2550,"In a little while I
heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down
his face.",1302
2551,“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.,1303
2552,“He didn’t even stop his car.”,1303
2553,"The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark
rustling trees.",1305
2554,"Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the
second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.",1305
2555,"“Daisy’s home,” he said.",1306
2556,"As we got out of the car he glanced at me and
frowned slightly.",1306
2557,"“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick.",1307
2558,"There’s nothing we can
do tonight.”",1307
2559,"A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.",1308
2560,"As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of
the situation in a few brisk phrases.",1308
2561,"“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting
you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some
supper—if you want any.” He opened the door.",1309
2562,“Come in.”,1309
2563,"“No, thanks.",1310
2564,But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi.,1310
2565,"I’ll wait
outside.”",1310
2566,Jordan put her hand on my arm.,1311
2567,"“Won’t you come in, Nick?”",1312
2568,"“No, thanks.”",1313
2569,I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone.,1314
2570,"But Jordan
lingered for a moment more.",1314
2571,"“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.",1315
2572,"I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,
and suddenly that included Jordan too.",1316
2573,"She must have seen something of
this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the
porch steps into the house.",1316
2574,"I sat down for a few minutes with my head
in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s
voice calling a taxi.",1316
2575,"Then I walked slowly down the drive away from
the house, intending to wait by the gate.",1316
2576,"I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped
from between two bushes into the path.",1317
2577,"I must have felt pretty weird
by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity
of his pink suit under the moon.",1317
2578,“What are you doing?” I inquired.,1318
2579,"“Just standing here, old sport.”",1319
2580,"Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.",1320
2581,"For all I knew he was
going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to
see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in
the dark shrubbery.",1320
2582,“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.,1321
2583,“Yes.”,1322
2584,He hesitated.,1323
2585,“Was she killed?”,1324
2586,“Yes.”,1325
2587,“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.,1326
2588,"It’s better that the shock
should all come at once.",1326
2589,She stood it pretty well.”,1326
2590,He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.,1327
2591,"“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car in
my garage.",1328
2592,"I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t be
sure.”",1328
2593,"I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to
tell him he was wrong.",1329
2594,“Who was the woman?” he inquired.,1330
2595,“Her name was Wilson.,1331
2596,Her husband owns the garage.,1331
2597,"How the devil did
it happen?”",1331
2598,"“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I
guessed at the truth.",1332
2599,“Was Daisy driving?”,1333
2600,"“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was.",1334
2601,"You see,
when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would
steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were
passing a car coming the other way.",1334
2602,"It all happened in a minute, but
it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were
somebody she knew.",1334
2603,"Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward
the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.",1334
2604,"The second
my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her
instantly.”",1334
2605,“It ripped her open—”,1335
2606,"“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced.",1336
2607,“Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it.,1336
2608,"I
tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency
brake.",1336
2609,Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.,1336
2610,"“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently.",1337
2611,"“I’m just going to
wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness
this afternoon.",1337
2612,"She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries
any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”",1337
2613,"“He won’t touch her,” I said.",1338
2614,“He’s not thinking about her.”,1338
2615,"“I don’t trust him, old sport.”",1339
2616,“How long are you going to wait?”,1340
2617,"“All night, if necessary.",1341
2618,"Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”",1341
2619,A new point of view occurred to me.,1342
2620,"Suppose Tom found out that Daisy
had been driving.",1342
2621,"He might think he saw a connection in it—he might
think anything.",1342
2622,"I looked at the house; there were two or three bright
windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground
floor.",1342
2623,"“You wait here,” I said.",1343
2624,"“I’ll see if there’s any sign of a
commotion.”",1343
2625,"I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel
softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps.",1344
2626,"The drawing-room curtains
were open, and I saw that the room was empty.",1344
2627,"Crossing the porch where
we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small
rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.",1344
2628,"The blind
was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.",1344
2629,"Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,
with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of
ale.",1345
2630,"He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his
earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.",1345
2631,"Once in a
while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.",1345
2632,"They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the
ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either.",1346
2633,"There was an unmistakable air
of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said
that they were conspiring together.",1346
2634,"As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the
dark road toward the house.",1347
2635,"Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in
the drive.",1347
2636,“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.,1348
2637,"“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated.",1349
2638,"“You’d better come home and get
some sleep.”",1349
2639,He shook his head.,1350
2640,“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.,1351
2641,"Good night, old sport.”",1351
2642,"He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his
scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of
the vigil.",1352
2643,"So I walked away and left him standing there in the
moonlight—watching over nothing.",1352
2644,"
                                 VIII",1353
2645,"I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the
Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,
frightening dreams.",1354
2646,"Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,
and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I
had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning
would be too late.",1354
2647,"Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was
leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.",1355
2648,"“Nothing happened,” he said wanly.",1356
2649,"“I waited, and about four o’clock
she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned
out the light.”",1356
2650,"His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when
we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.",1357
2651,"We pushed aside
curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of
dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of
splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.",1357
2652,"There was an inexplicable
amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they
hadn’t been aired for many days.",1357
2653,"I found the humidor on an unfamiliar
table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.",1357
2654,"Throwing open the French
windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.",1357
2655,"“You ought to go away,” I said.",1358
2656,"“It’s pretty certain they’ll trace
your car.”",1358
2657,"“Go away now, old sport?”",1359
2658,"“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”",1360
2659,He wouldn’t consider it.,1361
2660,"He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he
knew what she was going to do.",1361
2661,"He was clutching at some last hope and
I couldn’t bear to shake him free.",1361
2662,"It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with
Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass
against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played
out.",1362
2663,"I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without
reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.",1362
2664,She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.,1363
2665,"In various unrevealed
capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with
indiscernible barbed wire between.",1363
2666,"He found her excitingly
desirable.",1363
2667,"He went to her house, at first with other officers from
Camp Taylor, then alone.",1363
2668,"It amazed him—he had never been in such a
beautiful house before.",1363
2669,"But what gave it an air of breathless
intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her
as his tent out at camp was to him.",1363
2670,"There was a ripe mystery about it,
a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other
bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its
corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already
in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s
shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely
withered.",1363
2671,"It excited him, too, that many men had already loved
Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes.",1363
2672,"He felt their presence all
about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still
vibrant emotions.",1363
2673,"But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal
accident.",1364
2674,"However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was
at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the
invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.",1364
2675,"So he
made the most of his time.",1364
2676,"He took what he could get, ravenously and
unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took
her because he had no real right to touch her hand.",1364
2677,"He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under
false pretences.",1365
2678,"I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom
millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he
let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as
herself—that he was fully able to take care of her.",1365
2679,"As a matter of
fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing
behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government
to be blown anywhere about the world.",1365
2680,"But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had
imagined.",1366
2681,"He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but
now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a
grail.",1366
2682,"He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize
just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be.",1366
2683,"She vanished into her
rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.",1366
2684,"He felt
married to her, that was all.",1366
2685,"When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,
who was, somehow, betrayed.",1367
2686,"Her porch was bright with the bought
luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as
she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.",1367
2687,"She
had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming
than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and
mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many
clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the
hot struggles of the poor.",1367
2688,"“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,
old sport.",1369
2689,"I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she
didn’t, because she was in love with me too.",1369
2690,"She thought I knew a lot
because I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way off
my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden
I didn’t care.",1369
2691,"What was the use of doing great things if I could have
a better time telling her what I was going to do?”",1369
2692,"On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his
arms for a long, silent time.",1370
2693,"It was a cold fall day, with fire in the
room and her cheeks flushed.",1370
2694,"Now and then she moved and he changed his
arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.",1370
2695,"The afternoon
had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory
for the long parting the next day promised.",1370
2696,"They had never been closer
in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with
another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder
or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were
asleep.",1370
2697,He did extraordinarily well in the war.,1372
2698,"He was a captain before he
went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his
majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.",1372
2699,"After the
armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or
misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.",1372
2700,"He was worried now—there
was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters.",1372
2701,"She didn’t see
why he couldn’t come.",1372
2702,"She was feeling the pressure of the world
outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her
and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.",1372
2703,"For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids
and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of
the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new
tunes.",1373
2704,"All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the
“Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver
slippers shuffled the shining dust.",1373
2705,"At the grey tea hour there were
always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,
while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the
sad horns around the floor.",1373
2706,"Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the
season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with
half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and
chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor
beside her bed.",1374
2707,"And all the time something within her was crying for a
decision.",1374
2708,"She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision
must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable
practicality—that was close at hand.",1374
2709,"That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom
Buchanan.",1375
2710,"There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his
position, and Daisy was flattered.",1375
2711,"Doubtless there was a certain
struggle and a certain relief.",1375
2712,"The letter reached Gatsby while he was
still at Oxford.",1375
2713,"It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of
the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,
gold-turning light.",1377
2714,"The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew
and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.",1377
2715,"There was a
slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,
lovely day.",1377
2716,"“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window
and looked at me challengingly.",1378
2717,"“You must remember, old sport, she was
very excited this afternoon.",1378
2718,"He told her those things in a way that
frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap
sharper.",1378
2719,And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”,1378
2720,He sat down gloomily.,1379
2721,"“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were
first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”",1380
2722,Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.,1381
2723,"“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”",1382
2724,"What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his
conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?",1383
2725,"He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their
wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to
Louisville on the last of his army pay.",1384
2726,"He stayed there a week,
walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through
the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which
they had driven in her white car.",1384
2727,"Just as Daisy’s house had always
seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea
of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded
with a melancholy beauty.",1384
2728,"He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found
her—that he was leaving her behind.",1385
2729,"The day-coach—he was penniless
now—was hot.",1385
2730,"He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a
folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar
buildings moved by.",1385
2731,"Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow
trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have
seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.",1385
2732,"The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it
sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing
city where she had drawn her breath.",1386
2733,"He stretched out his hand
desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of
the spot that she had made lovely for him.",1386
2734,"But it was all going by too
fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part
of it, the freshest and the best, forever.",1386
2735,"It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the
porch.",1387
2736,"The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there
was an autumn flavour in the air.",1387
2737,"The gardener, the last one of
Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.",1387
2738,"“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.",1388
2739,"Leaves’ll start
falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”",1388
2740,"“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered.",1389
2741,He turned to me apologetically.,1389
2742,"“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”",1389
2743,I looked at my watch and stood up.,1390
2744,“Twelve minutes to my train.”,1391
2745,I didn’t want to go to the city.,1392
2746,"I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of
work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby.",1392
2747,"I
missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.",1392
2748,"“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.",1393
2749,"“Do, old sport.”",1394
2750,“I’ll call you about noon.”,1395
2751,We walked slowly down the steps.,1396
2752,"“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he
hoped I’d corroborate this.",1397
2753,“I suppose so.”,1398
2754,"“Well, goodbye.”",1399
2755,We shook hands and I started away.,1400
2756,"Just before I reached the hedge I
remembered something and turned around.",1400
2757,"“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn.",1401
2758,"“You’re worth the
whole damn bunch put together.”",1401
2759,I’ve always been glad I said that.,1402
2760,"It was the only compliment I ever
gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.",1402
2761,"First he
nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and
understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact
all the time.",1402
2762,"His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of
colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I
first came to his ancestral home, three months before.",1402
2763,"The lawn and
drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his
corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his
incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.",1402
2764,I thanked him for his hospitality.,1403
2765,"We were always thanking him for
that—I and the others.",1403
2766,"“Goodbye,” I called.",1404
2767,"“I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”",1404
2768,"Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an
interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.",1406
2769,"Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat
breaking out on my forehead.",1406
2770,"It was Jordan Baker; she often called me
up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between
hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other
way.",1406
2771,"Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,
as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the
office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.",1406
2772,"“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said.",1407
2773,"“I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going
down to Southampton this afternoon.”",1407
2774,"Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act
annoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.",1408
2775,“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”,1409
2776,“How could it have mattered then?”,1410
2777,Silence for a moment.,1411
2778,Then:,1411
2779,“However—I want to see you.”,1412
2780,"“I want to see you, too.”",1413
2781,"“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this
afternoon?”",1414
2782,“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”,1415
2783,“Very well.”,1416
2784,“It’s impossible this afternoon.,1417
2785,Various—”,1417
2786,"We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking
any longer.",1418
2787,"I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I
know I didn’t care.",1418
2788,"I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table
that day if I never talked to her again in this world.",1418
2789,"I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy.",1419
2790,"I
tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was
being kept open for long distance from Detroit.",1419
2791,"Taking out my
timetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train.",1419
2792,"Then I
leaned back in my chair and tried to think.",1419
2793,It was just noon.,1419
2794,"When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed
deliberately to the other side of the car.",1421
2795,"I supposed there’d be a
curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark
spots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over what
had happened, until it became less and less real even to him and he
could tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was
forgotten.",1421
2796,"Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at
the garage after we left there the night before.",1421
2797,"They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.",1422
2798,"She must have
broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she
was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had
already gone to Flushing.",1422
2799,"When they convinced her of this, she
immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the
affair.",1422
2800,"Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in
the wake of her sister’s body.",1422
2801,"Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front
of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on
the couch inside.",1423
2802,"For a while the door of the office was open, and
everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.",1423
2803,"Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.",1423
2804,"Michaelis
and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later
two or three men.",1423
2805,"Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger
to wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his own
place and made a pot of coffee.",1423
2806,"After that, he stayed there alone with
Wilson until dawn.",1423
2807,"About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering
changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.",1424
2808,"He
announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car
belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his
wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose
swollen.",1424
2809,"But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,
my God!” again in his groaning voice.",1425
2810,"Michaelis made a clumsy attempt
to distract him.",1425
2811,"“How long have you been married, George?",1426
2812,"Come on there, try and sit
still a minute, and answer my question.",1426
2813,"How long have you been
married?”",1426
2814,“Twelve years.”,1427
2815,“Ever had any children?,1428
2816,"Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a
question.",1428
2817,Did you ever have any children?”,1428
2818,"The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and
whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it
sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.",1429
2819,"He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was
stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably
around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from
time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.",1429
2820,"“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?",1430
2821,"Maybe even if you
haven’t been there for a long time?",1430
2822,"Maybe I could call up the church
and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”",1430
2823,“Don’t belong to any.”,1431
2824,"“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.",1432
2825,"You must
have gone to church once.",1432
2826,Didn’t you get married in a church?,1432
2827,"Listen,
George, listen to me.",1432
2828,Didn’t you get married in a church?”,1432
2829,“That was a long time ago.”,1433
2830,"The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment
he was silent.",1434
2831,"Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came
back into his faded eyes.",1434
2832,"“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.",1435
2833,“Which drawer?”,1436
2834,“That drawer—that one.”,1437
2835,Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.,1438
2836,"There was nothing in it
but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided
silver.",1438
2837,It was apparently new.,1438
2838,"“This?” he inquired, holding it up.",1439
2839,Wilson stared and nodded.,1440
2840,“I found it yesterday afternoon.,1441
2841,"She tried to tell me about it, but I
knew it was something funny.”",1441
2842,“You mean your wife bought it?”,1442
2843,“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”,1443
2844,"Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen
reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash.",1444
2845,"But conceivably
Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,
because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforter
left several explanations in the air.",1444
2846,"“Then he killed her,” said Wilson.",1445
2847,His mouth dropped open suddenly.,1445
2848,“Who did?”,1446
2849,“I have a way of finding out.”,1447
2850,"“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend.",1448
2851,"“This has been a strain to
you and you don’t know what you’re saying.",1448
2852,"You’d better try and sit
quiet till morning.”",1448
2853,“He murdered her.”,1449
2854,"“It was an accident, George.”",1450
2855,Wilson shook his head.,1451
2856,"His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened
slightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”",1451
2857,"“I know,” he said definitely.",1452
2858,"“I’m one of these trusting fellas and I
don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know
it.",1452
2859,It was the man in that car.,1452
2860,"She ran out to speak to him and he
wouldn’t stop.”",1452
2861,"Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that there
was any special significance in it.",1453
2862,"He believed that Mrs. Wilson had
been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any
particular car.",1453
2863,“How could she of been like that?”,1454
2864,"“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.",1455
2865,“Ah-h-h—”,1455
2866,"He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his
hand.",1456
2867,"“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”",1457
2868,"This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:
there was not enough of him for his wife.",1458
2869,"He was glad a little later
when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,
and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.",1458
2870,"About five o’clock it was blue
enough outside to snap off the light.",1458
2871,"Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small grey
clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the
faint dawn wind.",1459
2872,"“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence.",1460
2873,"“I told her she
might fool me but she couldn’t fool God.",1460
2874,"I took her to the
window”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and
leaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows what
you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing.",1460
2875,"You may fool me, but
you can’t fool God!’ ”",1460
2876,"Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at
the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale and
enormous, from the dissolving night.",1461
2877,"“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.",1462
2878,"“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him.",1463
2879,"Something made him
turn away from the window and look back into the room.",1463
2880,"But Wilson
stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding
into the twilight.",1463
2881,"By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a
car stopping outside.",1465
2882,"It was one of the watchers of the night before
who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which
he and the other man ate together.",1465
2883,"Wilson was quieter now, and
Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and
hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.",1465
2884,"His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to
Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that
he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee.",1466
2885,"He must have been tired and
walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon.",1466
2886,"Thus far
there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who
had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared
oddly from the side of the road.",1466
2887,"Then for three hours he disappeared
from view.",1466
2888,"The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,
that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time
going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car.",1466
2889,"On
the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and
perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to
know.",1466
2890,"By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the
way to Gatsby’s house.",1466
2891,So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.,1466
2892,"At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the
butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the
pool.",1468
2893,"He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had
amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to
pump it up.",1468
2894,"Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be
taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the
front right fender needed repair.",1468
2895,Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.,1469
2896,"Once he
stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he
needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among
the yellowing trees.",1469
2897,"No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep
and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone
to give it to if it came.",1470
2898,"I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t
believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.",1470
2899,"If that was
true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a
high price for living too long with a single dream.",1470
2900,"He must have
looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered
as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight
was upon the scarcely created grass.",1470
2901,"A new world, material without
being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted
fortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward
him through the amorphous trees.",1470
2902,"The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the
shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything
much about them.",1471
2903,"I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house
and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that
alarmed anyone.",1471
2904,"But they knew then, I firmly believe.",1471
2905,"With scarcely a
word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried
down to the pool.",1471
2906,"There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the
fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.",1472
2907,"With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden
mattress moved irregularly down the pool.",1472
2908,"A small gust of wind that
scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental
course with its accidental burden.",1472
2909,"The touch of a cluster of leaves
revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red
circle in the water.",1472
2910,"It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener
saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was
complete.",1473
2911,"
                                  IX",1474
2912,"After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and
the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and
newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door.",1475
2913,"A rope stretched
across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but
little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and
there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the
pool.",1475
2914,"Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the
expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and
the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper
reports next morning.",1475
2915,"Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,
eager, and untrue.",1476
2916,"When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought
to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale
would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might
have said anything, didn’t say a word.",1476
2917,"She showed a surprising amount
of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes
under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never
seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,
that her sister had been into no mischief whatever.",1476
2918,"She convinced
herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very
suggestion was more than she could endure.",1476
2919,"So Wilson was reduced to a
man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its
simplest form.",1476
2920,And it rested there.,1476
2921,But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential.,1477
2922,"I found myself
on Gatsby’s side, and alone.",1477
2923,"From the moment I telephoned news of the
catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every
practical question, was referred to me.",1477
2924,"At first I was surprised and
confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or
speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because
no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense
personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.",1477
2925,"I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her
instinctively and without hesitation.",1478
2926,"But she and Tom had gone away
early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.",1478
2927,“Left no address?”,1479
2928,“No.”,1480
2929,“Say when they’d be back?”,1481
2930,“No.”,1482
2931,“Any idea where they are?,1483
2932,How I could reach them?”,1483
2933,“I don’t know.,1484
2934,Can’t say.”,1484
2935,I wanted to get somebody for him.,1485
2936,"I wanted to go into the room where
he lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby.",1485
2937,"Don’t
worry.",1485
2938,Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”,1485
2939,Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book.,1486
2940,"The butler gave me
his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the
time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the
phone.",1486
2941,“Will you ring again?”,1487
2942,“I’ve rung three times.”,1488
2943,“It’s very important.”,1489
2944,“Sorry.,1490
2945,I’m afraid no one’s there.”,1490
2946,"I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they
were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled
it.",1491
2947,"But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with
shocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:",1491
2948,"“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.",1492
2949,"You’ve got
to try hard.",1492
2950,I can’t go through this alone.”,1492
2951,"Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going
upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d
never told me definitely that his parents were dead.",1493
2952,"But there was
nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,
staring down from the wall.",1493
2953,"Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,
which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next
train.",1494
2954,That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it.,1494
2955,"I was sure
he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a
wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem
arrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and
newspaper men.",1494
2956,"When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began
to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby
and me against them all.",1494
2957, Dear Mr. Carraway.,1495
2958,"This has been one of the most terrible shocks of
 my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all.",1495
2959,"Such a
 mad act as that man did should make us all think.",1495
2960,"I cannot come down
 now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get
 mixed up in this thing now.",1495
2961,"If there is anything I can do a little
 later let me know in a letter by Edgar.",1495
2962,"I hardly know where I am when
 I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and
 out.",1495
2963,                               Yours truly,1496
2964,                             Meyer Wolfshiem,1497
2965,and then hasty addenda beneath:,1498
2966, Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.,1499
2967,"When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was
calling I thought this would be Daisy at last.",1500
2968,"But the connection came
through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.",1500
2969,“This is Slagle speaking …”,1501
2970,“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.,1502
2971,"“Hell of a note, isn’t it?",1503
2972,Get my wire?”,1503
2973,“There haven’t been any wires.”,1504
2974,"“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly.",1505
2975,"“They picked him up when
he handed the bonds over the counter.",1505
2976,"They got a circular from New
York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before.",1505
2977,"What d’you know
about that, hey?",1505
2978,You never can tell in these hick towns—”,1505
2979,“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly.,1506
2980,"“Look here—this isn’t Mr.
Gatsby.",1506
2981,Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”,1506
2982,"There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an
exclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.",1507
2983,"I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz
arrived from a town in Minnesota.",1509
2984,"It said only that the sender was
leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.",1509
2985,"It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,
bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day.",1510
2986,"His
eyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag and
umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse
grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat.",1510
2987,"He was on
the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him
sit down while I sent for something to eat.",1510
2988,"But he wouldn’t eat, and
the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.",1510
2989,"“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said.",1511
2990,"“It was all in the
Chicago newspaper.",1511
2991,I started right away.”,1511
2992,“I didn’t know how to reach you.”,1512
2993,"His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.",1513
2994,"“It was a madman,” he said.",1514
2995,“He must have been mad.”,1514
2996,“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.,1515
2997,“I don’t want anything.,1516
2998,"I’m all right now, Mr.—”",1516
2999,“Carraway.”,1517
3000,"“Well, I’m all right now.",1518
3001,Where have they got Jimmy?”,1518
3002,"I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him
there.",1519
3003,"Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into
the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly
away.",1519
3004,"After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth
ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and
unpunctual tears.",1520
3005,"He had reached an age where death no longer has the
quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the
first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great
rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be
mixed with an awed pride.",1520
3006,"I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he
took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been
deferred until he came.",1520
3007,"“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”",1521
3008,“Gatz is my name.”,1522
3009,“—Mr.,1523
3010,Gatz.,1523
3011,I thought you might want to take the body West.”,1523
3012,He shook his head.,1524
3013,“Jimmy always liked it better down East.,1525
3014,"He rose up to his position in
the East.",1525
3015,"Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”",1525
3016,“We were close friends.”,1526
3017,"“He had a big future before him, you know.",1527
3018,"He was only a young man,
but he had a lot of brain power here.”",1527
3019,"He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.",1528
3020,"“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man.",1529
3021,"A man like James J.
Hill.",1529
3022,He’d of helped build up the country.”,1529
3023,"“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.",1530
3024,"He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the
bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.",1531
3025,"That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to
know who I was before he would give his name.",1532
3026,"“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.",1533
3027,“Oh!” He sounded relieved.,1534
3028,“This is Klipspringer.”,1534
3029,"I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend at
Gatsby’s grave.",1535
3030,"I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a
sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself.",1535
3031,"They
were hard to find.",1535
3032,"“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said.",1536
3033,"“Three o’clock, here at the house.",1536
3034,I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”,1536
3035,"“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily.",1537
3036,"“Of course I’m not likely to see
anybody, but if I do.”",1537
3037,His tone made me suspicious.,1538
3038,“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”,1539
3039,"“Well, I’ll certainly try.",1540
3040,What I called up about is—”,1540
3041,"“Wait a minute,” I interrupted.",1541
3042,“How about saying you’ll come?”,1541
3043,"“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with
some people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be with
them tomorrow.",1542
3044,"In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something.",1542
3045,"Of
course I’ll do my best to get away.”",1542
3046,"I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for he
went on nervously:",1543
3047,“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there.,1544
3048,"I wonder if
it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on.",1544
3049,"You see,
they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them.",1544
3050,"My
address is care of B. F.—”",1544
3051,"I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.",1545
3052,"After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I
telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.",1546
3053,"However, that was
my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at
Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have known
better than to call him.",1546
3054,"The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer
Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way.",1547
3055,"The door that I
pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “The
Swastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone
inside.",1547
3056,"But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an
argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess
appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile
eyes.",1547
3057,"“Nobody’s in,” she said.",1548
3058,“Mr.,1548
3059,Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”,1548
3060,"The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun to
whistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.",1549
3061,“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”,1550
3062,"“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”",1551
3063,"At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”

3065,"“I’ll give it to him
when he gets back.”",1553
3066,“But I know he’s there.”,1554

and down her hips.",1555
3068,"“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” she
scolded.",1556
3069,“We’re getting sickantired of it.,1556
3070,"When I say he’s in Chicago,
he’s in Chicago.”",1556
3071,I mentioned Gatsby.,1557
3072,“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again.,1558
3073,"“Will you just—What was your
name?”",1558
3074,She vanished.,1559
3075,"In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the
doorway, holding out both hands.",1559
3076,"He drew me into his office, remarking
in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered
me a cigar.",1559
3077,"“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said.",1560
3078,"“A young major
just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.",1560

couldn’t buy some regular clothes.",1560

came into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a

away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told
me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good.",1564

the American Legion and he used to stand high there.",1564

some work for a client of mine up to Albany.",1564

that in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”",1564

3106,"I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,
so I stood up.",1573

only nodded and shook my hand.",1575

not after he is dead,” he suggested.",1576

fingers.",1578

with many hands.",1579

there!” and then sought admiration from my eyes.",1579

often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.",1579

well.”",1580

now there was a reason for it.",1582

him.",1582

from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin.",1600

Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a
December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into
their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye.",1610

the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and the
chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught
sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are you
going to the Ordways’?",1610

lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly
wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.",1612
3189,"I am part of that, a
little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent
from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are
still called through decades by a family’s name.",1612
3190,"I see now that this
has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and
Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some
deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.",1612
3191,"Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware
of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the
Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the
children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of
distortion.",1613

once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging
sky and a lustreless moon.",1613

leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the
line I decided to come back home.",1614

thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.",1615

leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent
sea to sweep my refuse away.",1615
3202,"I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and
around what had happened to us together, and what had happened
afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big
chair.",1615
3203,"She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like
a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the
colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the
fingerless glove on her knee.",1616
3204,"When I had finished she told me without
comment that she was engaged to another man.",1616
3205,"I doubted that, though
there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I
pretended to be surprised.",1616
3206,"For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t
making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up
to say goodbye.",1616

me over on the telephone.",1617

was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”",1617

driving a car?”",1619

to make such a wrong guess.",1621

straightforward person.",1621

call it honour.”",1622

sorry, I turned away.",1623
3222,One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.,1625
3223,"He was walking ahead
of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a
little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving
sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.",1625
3224,"Just as
I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into
the windows of a jewellery store.",1625
3225,"Suddenly he saw me and walked back,
holding out his hand.",1625
3226,"“What’s the matter, Nick?",1626
3227,Do you object to shaking hands with me?”,1626
3228,“Yes.,1627
3229,You know what I think of you.”,1627
3230,"“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly.",1628
3231,“Crazy as hell.,1628
3232,"I don’t know
what’s the matter with you.”",1628
3233,"“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”",1629
3234,"He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about
those missing hours.",1630
3235,"I started to turn away, but he took a step after
me and grabbed my arm.",1630
3236,"“I told him the truth,” he said.",1631
3237,"“He came to the door while we were
getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in
he tried to force his way upstairs.",1631
3238,"He was crazy enough to kill me if
I hadn’t told him who owned the car.",1631
3239,"His hand was on a revolver in his
pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.",1631
3240,“What if I did tell him?,1631
3241,That fellow had it coming to him.,1631
3242,"He threw
dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a tough
one.",1631
3243,"He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even
stopped his car.”",1631
3244,"There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it
wasn’t true.",1632
3245,"“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when
I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits
sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby.",1633
3246,"By
God it was awful—”",1633
3247,"I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done
was, to him, entirely justified.",1634
3248,"It was all very careless and
confused.",1634
3249,"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up
things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their
vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let
other people clean up the mess they had made …",1634
3250,"I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as
though I were talking to a child.",1635
3251,"Then he went into the jewellery
store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff
buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.",1635
3252,"Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had
grown as long as mine.",1637
3253,"One of the taxi drivers in the village never
took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and
pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to
East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story
about it all his own.",1637
3254,"I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when
I got off the train.",1637
3255,"I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,
dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still
hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,
and the cars going up and down his drive.",1638
3256,"One night I did hear a
material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps.",1638
3257,"But I
didn’t investigate.",1638
3258,"Probably it was some final guest who had been away
at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.",1638
3259,"On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,
I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once
more.",1639
3260,"On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a
piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,
drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.",1639
3261,"Then I wandered down to the
beach and sprawled out on the sand.",1639
3262,"Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any
lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the
Sound.",1640
3263,"And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to
melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that
flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new
world.",1640
3264,"Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s
house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all
human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his
breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic
contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the
last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for
wonder.",1640
3265,"And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of
Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of
Daisy’s dock.",1641
3266,"He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream
must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.",1641
3267,"He
did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that
vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic
rolled on under the night.",1641
3268,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by
year recedes before us.",1642
3269,"It eluded us then, but that’s no
matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And
one fine morning—",1642
3270,"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
the past.",1643
