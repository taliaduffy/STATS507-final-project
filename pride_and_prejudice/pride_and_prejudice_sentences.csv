2,"_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “lovingby allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction appliesto books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not verynumerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, itbrings a curious consequence with it.",2
3,"There is much more difference asto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “byallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right andproper thing to love them.",2
4,"And in the sect--fairly large and yetunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably befound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of thenovels.",2
5,"To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ NorthangerAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubtedcritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, thatof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached withdifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthrallingin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisitedelicacy and keeping.",2
6,"The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedlytheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almostwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting thatEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny mightvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris andothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense andSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it doesnot want them._",2
7,"_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent voteswould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the presentbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for MissAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible chargeof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma.",3
8,"_It is the larger, the more varied, themore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rathermore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her mostpeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as theEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody.",3
9,"On the other hand,I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly.",3
10,"Itseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the mosteminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contentionin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to showcause._",3
11,"_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind thereader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised andfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till1813, only four years before her death.",4
12,"I do not know whether, in thiscombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and thecritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinctsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, itpossesses over all the others.",4
13,"The plot, though not elaborate, is almostregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incidentcould be retrenched without loss to the story.",4
14,"The elopement of Lydiaand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup dethéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of thestory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.",4
15,"All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after thesame unostentatious, but masterly fashion.",4
16,"There is no attempt at thehide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions betweenFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to theintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not thinkthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book.",4
17,"Although Miss Austenalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded heropportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent tobe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectlynatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct givenby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) fromthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positiveaversion to actual love.",4
18,"I do not know whether the all-grasping hand ofthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I daresay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling orgarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle anddelicate for pit and gallery.",4
19,"But if the attempt were made, it wouldcertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist canavail himself, appear at once on the stage._",4
20,"_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical tomore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highestmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist.",5
21,"It sets off his other giftsand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of itwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quiteconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical.",5
22,"But a very badly-builtnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or whichdisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of allfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plotacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths.",5
23,"And despite theability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for oneshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain whatseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of herfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit JohnThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are stillsuperior to them._",5
24,"_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicatethat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than toexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differentlyapprehended by different persons.",6
25,"To me this humour seems to possess agreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other ofthe numerous species of this great British genus.",6
26,"The differences ofscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr.",6
27,"Spectator,” and inJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that wasmasculine.",6
28,"But the likeness of quality consists in a great number ofcommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects.",6
29,Also there is in both acertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty.,6
30,"It is the custom with thosewho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with thesavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousnessof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes thather immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very muchprotest.",6
31,"Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though arestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight inroasting and cutting up a fool.",6
32,"A man in the early eighteenth century,of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the earlynineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunatehusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all theinnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to playat blind-man’s-buff.",6
33,"But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damselof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selectedMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have beenwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in thedays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (Ithink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’sown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets overher son.",6
34,"But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in theEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitousfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough andsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire.",6
35,"If cynicism meansthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hellsbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, andthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, thenevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in afool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, isa cynic.",6
36,And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one.,6
37,"She may evenhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, shetook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting atwork her fools and her mean persons.",6
38,"I think she did take this delight,and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while shewas immensely the better for it as an artist._",6
39,"_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observedthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added thatwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniaturepainter.",7
40,"To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use theterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memlingat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, thanof Cosway or any of his kind.",7
41,And I am not so certain that I shouldmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her.,7
42,"If her world is amicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as thelittleness.",7
43,She does not touch what she did not feel herself called topaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did notfeel herself called to touch.,7
44,"It is at least remarkable that in two veryshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of notmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left asingle failure.",7
45,It is possible that the romantic paste in hercomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardlyanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-centuryseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality.,7
46,"Even Scottrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics andGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell.",7
47,"Miss Austen was anEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time whenladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which mightpierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of thegravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct weresubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against whichMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particulartaste or judgment.",7
48,"Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frosttouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journeyeven in a black one._",7
49,"_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things whichonly genius knows.",8
50,"The one was humanity, and the other was art.",8
51,"On thefirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, aretrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if shehas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makesthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive.",8
52,"Take almost anyFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriouslypiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression.",8
53,"You getnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you canshape a real impression out of the rest.",8
54,"But with Miss Austen themyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.",8
55,Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous.,8
56,When (to take the present bookonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs.,8
57,"Bennet would havestirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by thebreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray withjust and outspoken admiration.",8
58,"Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, Ishould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put herto Addison in others._",8
59,"_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appearsnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.Collins.",9
60,"Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addisonever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself.",9
61,It hasbeen said that no one ever was like him.,9
62,"But in the first place,_ he_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundredsof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, anddistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent atthe end of the eighteenth century.",9
63,"It is very interesting that wepossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled firstdraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood.",9
64,"Theformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portraitis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural.",9
65,"Mr.Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive.",9
66,"In fact, for all the“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certainside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-centuryhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,its selfishness, receives exhibition.",9
67,"I will not admit that one speechor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciledwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actionsare historically true._",9
68,_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorilyexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him thefigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.,10
69,"The latter, likeMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration.",10
70,"There is,perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to mevery faint indeed.",10
71,"Even now I do not think that it would be impossibleto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noblebirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,as Lady Catherine.",10
72,"A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the LadyPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities ofdeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom presentthemselves now.",10
73,"As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and evenMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on himfor the “impropriety” of his conduct.",10
74,"His wife was evidently, and mustalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot heror himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit butthe ironic.",10
75,"From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis ofthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in theconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--thateven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters.",10
76,"It isdifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense ofthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank hisconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.",10
77,Let us hope for better things.,10
78,"Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiryto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has justrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether thesepleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are theresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’sreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt bythe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, asthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fictionoutside of these four._",10
79,"_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has beenalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beautiesdifficult in any space, and impossible in this.",11
80,"Mrs. Bennet we haveglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitelyamusing or more horribly true.",11
81,"Much the same may be said of Kitty andLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would havedifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly andvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the commonweaknesses of woman at such different ages.",11
82,"With Mary, Miss Austen hastaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interestingtraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in doomingher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits offirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing andsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; butperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockingsin that Fordyce-belectured generation.",11
83,"It is at any rate difficult notto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection andrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall.",11
84,"I sometimes wishthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unitethese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothepoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._",11
85,"_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss deBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, thoughdelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line betweencomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, andthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch indealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch indrab of another.",12
86,"Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yetnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either witha cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality.",12
87,But thehero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._,12
88,"_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting ofMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters intocomparison.",13
89,"It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride isunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, whilehis falling in love at all is not extremely probable.",13
90,Here again Icannot go with the objectors.,13
91,"Darcy’s own account of the way in whichhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; andnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for itssudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’sscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous.",13
92,Nothing ineven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change ofhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley.,13
93,"Had hebeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smartingunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had comehusband-hunting.",13
94,"His being neither is exactly consistent with theprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not reallyinjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love.",13
95,"As for his being inlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of thatphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personalcharm._",13
96,"_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austenherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing ratherto be felt than to be explained.",14
97,Elizabeth of course belongs to the_allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus.,14
98,"Miss Austen wasalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; andexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any ratesometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothingabout her looks.",14
99,"But her chief difference from other heroines of thelively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almoststrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--andsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all herpropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue.",14
100,"Elizabeth can giveat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never“scratches,” and she never attacks first.",14
101,"Some of the merestobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her earlyspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes toserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in thefinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable.",14
102,Thentoo she is a perfectly natural girl.,14
103,She does not disguise from herselfor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality withas personal a feeling.,14
104,"(By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners ofthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the samekind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might havebeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from personswho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.)",14
105,And she lets theinjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her familyaggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._,14
106,"_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as acommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to herplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of acertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.",15
107,"Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificentDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at theidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.",15
108,"Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the ideathat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away withher if they can.",15
109,"Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her.",15
110,"The form ofpassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was soinvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both ofthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.",15
111,"But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would havemarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, andanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have lookedto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the DellaCruscans of this._",15
112,"_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason ofcharm?--it is there.",16
113,There were better sense in the sad mechanicexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not.,16
114,"Inthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of youngladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are atleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit canhelp doing so.",16
115,"Their names are, in chronological order, ElizabethBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and BarbaraGrant.",16
116,"I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; Ishould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Dianaand Barbara.",16
117,"But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any oneof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._",16

121,"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on hisfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the mindsof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightfulproperty of some one or other of their daughters.",20
122,"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard thatNetherfield Park is let at last?”",21

196,"“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at theassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”",68
197,“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.,69
198,She has two niecesof her own.,69
199,"She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinionof her.”",69
200,"“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you donot depend on her serving you.”",70
201,"Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to containherself, began scolding one of her daughters.",71
202,"“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake!",72
203,Have a littlecompassion on my nerves.,72
204,You tear them to pieces.”,72

206,"“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully.",74
207,"“Whenis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”",74
208,“To-morrow fortnight.”,75
209,"“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back tillthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, forshe will not know him herself.”",76
210,"“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduceMr. Bingley to _her_.”",77
211,"“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with himmyself; how can you be so teasing?”",78
212,“I honour your circumspection.,79
213,A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainlyvery little.,79
214,One cannot know what a man really is by the end of afortnight.,79
215,"But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and afterall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, Iwill take it on myself.”",79
216,The girls stared at their father.,80
217,"Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,nonsense!”",80
218,“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.,81
219,"“Doyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid onthem, as nonsense?",81
220,I cannot quite agree with you _there_.,81
221,"What say you,Mary?",81
222,"For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and readgreat books, and make extracts.”",81
223,"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.",82
224,"“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.Bingley.”",83
225,"“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",84
226,“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before?,85
227,"If Ihad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called onhim.",85
228,"It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, wecannot escape the acquaintance now.”",85
229,"The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joywas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all thewhile.",86
230,"“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet!",87
231,But I knew I shouldpersuade you at last.,87
232,I was sure you loved your girls too well toneglect such an acquaintance.,87
233,"Well, how pleased I am!",87
234,"And it is such agood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said aword about it till now.”",87
235,"“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",88
236,"“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door wasshut.",89
237,"“I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;or me either, for that matter.",89
238,"At our time of life, it is not sopleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; butfor your sakes we would do anything.",89
239,"Lydia, my love, though you _are_the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the nextball.”",89
240,"“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ theyoungest, I’m the tallest.”",90
241,"The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he wouldreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him todinner.",91

245,CHAPTER III.,97
247,"Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her fivedaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from herhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.",99
248,"They attacked himin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, anddistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were atlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,Lady Lucas.",99
249,Her report was highly favourable.,99
250,Sir William had beendelighted with him.,99
251,"He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremelyagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assemblywith a large party.",99
252,Nothing could be more delightful!,99
253,To be fond ofdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very livelyhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.,99
254,"“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally wellmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”",100
255,"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about tenminutes with him in his library.",101
256,"He had entertained hopes of beingadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heardmuch; but he saw only the father.",101
257,"The ladies were somewhat morefortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upperwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.",101
258,"An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already hadMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to herhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.",102
259,"Mr. Bingleywas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable toaccept the honour of their invitation, etc.",102
260,Mrs. Bennet was quitedisconcerted.,102
261,"She could not imagine what business he could have in townso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear thathe might always be flying about from one place to another, and neversettled at Netherfield as he ought to be.",102
262,Lady Lucas quieted her fears alittle by starting the idea of his,102
264,     “When the Party entered”,104
266,being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and areport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies andseven gentlemen with him to the assembly.,106
267,"The girls grieved over such anumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearingthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,his five sisters and a cousin.",106
268,"And when the party entered theassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, histwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.",106
269,"Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasantcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners.",107
270,"His sisters were fine women,with an air of decided fashion.",107
271,"His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merelylooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attentionof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, andthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes afterhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.",107
272,"The gentlemenpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he wasmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to beproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all hislarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with hisfriend.",107
273,"Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving onehimself at Netherfield.",108
274,Such amiable qualities must speak forthemselves.,108
275,What a contrast between him and his friend!,108
276,"Mr. Darcy dancedonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined beingintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening inwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",108
277,His character was decided.,108
278,"He was the proudest, most disagreeable man inthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",108
279,"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters.",108
280,"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sitdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him andMr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press hisfriend to join it.",109
281,"“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance.",110
282,I hate to see youstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner.,110
283,You had much betterdance.”,110
284,“I certainly shall not.,111
285,"You know how I detest it, unless I amparticularly acquainted with my partner.",111
286,"At such an assembly as this, itwould be insupportable.",111
287,"Your sisters are engaged, and there is notanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me tostand up with.”",111
288,"“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for akingdom!",112
289,"Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in mylife as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,uncommonly pretty.”",112
290,"“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",113
291,"“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!",114
292,"But there is oneof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and Idare say very agreeable.",114
293,Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”,114
295,“She is tolerable”,116
297,"“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment atElizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in nohumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slightedby other men.",118
298,"You had better return to your partner and enjoy hersmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”",118
299,Mr. Bingley followed his advice.,119
300,Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabethremained with no very cordial feelings towards him.,119
301,"She told the story,however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",119
302,The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.,120
303,Mrs.Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfieldparty.,120
304,"Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had beendistinguished by his sisters.",120
305,"Jane was as much gratified by this as hermother could be, though in a quieter way.",120
306,Elizabeth felt Jane’spleasure.,120
307,"Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the mostaccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had beenfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that theyhad yet learnt to care for at a ball.",120
308,"They returned, therefore, in goodspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which theywere the principal inhabitants.",120
309,They found Mr. Bennet still up.,120
310,"With abook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations.",120
311,He had rather hoped that all his wife’sviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that hehad a very different story to hear.,120
312,"“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a mostdelightful evening, a most excellent ball.",121
313,I wish you had been there.,121
314,"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.",121
315,"Everybody said how wellshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced withher twice.",121
316,"Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with hertwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime.",121
317,"First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.",121
318,"I was so vexed to see him standup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobodycan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was goingdown the dance.",121
319,"So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, andasked her for the two next.",121
320,"Then, the two third he danced with MissKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Janeagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”",121
321,"“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,“he would not have danced half so much!",122
322,"For God’s sake, say no more ofhis partners.",122
323,O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”,122
324,"“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him.",123
325,Heis so excessively handsome!,123
326,and his sisters are charming women.,123
327,I neverin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses.,123
328,I dare say thelace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”,123
329,Here she was interrupted again.,124
330,Mr. Bennet protested against anydescription of finery.,124
331,"She was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and someexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",124
332,"“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not atall worth pleasing.",125
333,"So high and so conceited, that there was no enduringhim!",125
334,"He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so verygreat!",125
335,Not handsome enough to dance with!,125
336,"I wish you had been there, mydear, to have given him one of your set-downs.",125
337,I quite detest the man.”,125
339,CHAPTER IV.,129
341,"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious inher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very muchshe admired him.",131
342,"“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!",132
343,"so much ease,with such perfect good breeding!”",132
344,"“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man oughtlikewise to be if he possibly can.",133
345,His character is thereby complete.”,133
346,“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.,134
347,Idid not expect such a compliment.”,134
348,“Did not you?,135
349,_I_ did for you.,135
350,But that is one great difference betweenus.,135
351,"Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.",135
352,Whatcould be more natural than his asking you again?,135
353,He could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman inthe room.,135
354,No thanks to his gallantry for that.,135
355,"Well, he certainly isvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.",135
356,You have liked many astupider person.”,135
357,“Dear Lizzy!”,136
358,"“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.",137
359,You never see a fault in anybody.,137
360,All the world are good and agreeablein your eyes.,137
361,I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”,137
362,“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speakwhat I think.”,138
363,“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.,139
364,"With _your_good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers!",139
365,Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with iteverywhere.,139
366,"But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take thegood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothingof the bad,--belongs to you alone.",139
367,"And so, you like this man’s sisters,too, do you?",139
368,Their manners are not equal to his.”,139
369,"“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them.",140
370,"Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keephis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her.”",140
371,"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, andwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she wasvery little disposed to approve them.",141
372,"They were, in fact, very fineladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in thepower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.",141
373,"They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first privateseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in thehabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with peopleof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well ofthemselves and meanly of others.",141
374,They were of a respectable family inthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on theirmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had beenacquired by trade.,141
375,"Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,but did not live to do it.",142
376,"Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, andsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation topurchase.",142
377,"His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; butthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who hadmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to considerhis house as her home when it suited her.",143
378,"Mr. Bingley had not been ofage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, tolook at Netherfield House.",143
379,"He did look at it, and into it, for half anhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfiedwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",143
380,"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of agreat opposition of character.",144
381,"Bingley was endeared to Darcy by theeasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no dispositioncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own henever appeared dissatisfied.",144
382,"On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingleyhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.",144
383,"Inunderstanding, Darcy was the superior.",144
384,Bingley was by no meansdeficient; but Darcy was clever.,144
385,"He was at the same time haughty,reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were notinviting.",144
386,In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.,144
387,Bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continuallygiving offence.,144
388,The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic.,145
389,"Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettiergirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquaintedwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angelmore beautiful.",145
390,"Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of peoplein whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he hadfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention orpleasure.",145
391,Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled toomuch.,145
392,"Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admiredher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whomthey should not object to know more of.",146
393,Miss Bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose.,146
395,CHAPTER V.,150
397,Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennetswere particularly intimate.,152
398,"Sir William Lucas had been formerly in tradein Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.",152
399,"Thedistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly.",152
400,"It had given him adisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house abouta mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where hecould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled bybusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.",152
401,"For,though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on thecontrary, he was all attention to everybody.",152
402,"By nature inoffensive,friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made himcourteous.",152
403,"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be avaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.",153
404,They had several children.,153
405,"The eldestof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, wasElizabeth’s intimate friend.",153
406,That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over aball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assemblybrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.,154
407,"“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civilself-command, to Miss Lucas.",155
408,“_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”,155
409,“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”,156
410,"“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.",157
411,"To besure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--somethingabout Mr. Robinson.”",157
412,“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did notI mention it to you?,158
413,"Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Merytonassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many prettywomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?",158
414,"and hisanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”",158
415,“Upon my word!,159
416,"Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem asif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”",159
417,"“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” saidCharlotte.",160
418,“Mr.,160
419,"Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,is he?",160
420,Poor Eliza!,160
421,to be only just _tolerable_.”,160
422,"“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by hisill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quitea misfortune to be liked by him.",161
423,Mrs. Long told me last night that hesat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”,161
426,"“Are you quite sure, ma’am?",164
427,Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.,164
428,“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”,164
429,"“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and hecould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at beingspoke to.”",165
430,"“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unlessamong his intimate acquaintance.",166
431,With _them_ he is remarkablyagreeable.”,166
432,"“I do not believe a word of it, my dear.",167
433,"If he had been so veryagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.",167
434,"But I can guess how itwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he hadheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to cometo the ball in a hack chaise.”",167
435,"“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but Iwish he had danced with Eliza.”",168
436,"“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,if I were you.”",169
437,"“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”",170
438,"“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as prideoften does, because there is an excuse for it.",171
439,"One cannot wonder that sovery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,should think highly of himself.",171
440,"If I may so express it, he has a _right_to be proud.”",171
441,"“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”",172
442,"“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe.",173
443,"By all that I haveever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that humannature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of somequality or other, real or imaginary.",173
444,"Vanity and pride are differentthings, though the words are often used synonymously.",173
445,A person may beproud without being vain.,173
446,Pride relates more to our opinion ofourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”,173
447,"“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with hissisters, “I should not care how proud I was.",174
448,"I would keep a pack offoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”",174
449,"“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottledirectly.”",175
450,The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that shewould; and the argument ended only with the visit.,176
453,CHAPTER VI.,181
455,The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.,183
456,The visitwas returned in due form.,183
457,"Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on thegood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards thetwo eldest.",183
458,"By Jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment ofeverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration.",183
459,"Itwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; andto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in away to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Janeunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and anuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from thesuspicions of the impertinent.",183
460,"She mentioned this to her friend, MissLucas.",183
461,"“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to imposeon the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded.",184
462,"If a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in thedark.",184
463,"There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.",184
464,We can all_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement.,184
465,"In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_affection than she feels.",184
466,"Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but hemay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”",184
467,"“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.",185
468,"If _I_ canperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not todiscover it too.”",185
469,"“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”",186
470,"“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to concealit, he must find it out.”",187
471,"“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.",188
472,"But though Bingley and Janemeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together.",188
473,Jane shouldtherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command hisattention.,188
474,"When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for fallingin love as much as she chooses.”",188
475,"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determinedto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.",189
476,Butthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design.,189
477,"As yet shecannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of itsreasonableness.",189
478,She has known him only a fortnight.,189
479,"She danced fourdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,and has since dined in company with him four times.",189
480,This is not quiteenough to make her understand his character.”,189
481,“Not as you represent it.,190
482,"Had she merely _dined_ with him, she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you mustremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and fourevenings may do a great deal.”",190
483,"“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they bothlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any otherleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”",191
484,"“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and ifshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth.",192
485,Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.,192
486,"Ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, orever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in theleast.",192
487,They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife.”,192
488,"“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.",193
489,"You know it is notsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”",193
490,"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend.",194
491,"Mr. Darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at theball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.",194
492,"But nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hadhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.",194
493,Tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.,194
494,"Though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.",194
495,"Ofthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with.",194
496,"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversingwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others.",195
497,His doing sodrew her notice.,195
498,"It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party wereassembled.",195
499,"“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to myconversation with Colonel Forster?”",196
500,“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”,197
501,"“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I seewhat he is about.",198
502,"He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin bybeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”",198
504,"On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, sheturned to him and said,--",200
505,"“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly welljust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball atMeryton?”",201
506,“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a ladyenergetic.”,202
507,“You are severe on us.”,203
508,"“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas.",204
509,"“I am goingto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”",204
510,“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting meto play and sing before anybody and everybody!,205
511,"If my vanity had taken amusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I wouldreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit ofhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancingat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here isof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--andI shall keep mine to swell my song.”",205
512,"Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.",206
513,"After a songor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that shewould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by hersister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one inthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was alwaysimpatient for display.",206
514,"Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given herapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceitedmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than shehad reached.",207
515,"Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to withmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at theend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude byScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who withsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly indancing at one end of the room.",207
516,"Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode ofpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was toomuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucaswas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--",208
517,"“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!",209
518,"There isnothing like dancing, after all.",209
519,I consider it as one of the firstrefinements of polished societies.”,209
520,"“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongstthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”",210
521,Sir William only smiled.,211
522,"“Your friend performs delightfully,” hecontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubtnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”",211
523,"“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”",212
524,"“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.",213
525,Doyou often dance at St. James’s?”,213
526,"“Never, sir.”",214
527,“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”,215
528,“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”,216
529,"“You have a house in town, I conclude?”",217
530,Mr. Darcy bowed.,218
531,"“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond ofsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air ofLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”",219
532,"He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed tomake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he wasstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out toher,--",220
533,"“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?",221
534,"Mr. Darcy, you must allowme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.",221
535,"Youcannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, thoughextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantlydrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--",221
536,"“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing.",222
537,I entreat younot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”,222
538,"Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour ofher hand, but in vain.",223
539,Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William atall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.,223
540,"“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny methe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes theamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige usfor one half hour.”",224
541,“Mr.,225
542,"Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.",225
543,"“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, wecannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such apartner?”",226
544,"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.",227
545,"Her resistance had not injuredher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with somecomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--",227
546,“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”,228
547,“I should imagine not.”,229
548,"“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass manyevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite ofyour opinion.",230
549,I was never more annoyed!,230
550,"The insipidity, and yet thenoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all thesepeople!",230
551,What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”,230
552,"“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.",231
553,My mind was moreagreeably engaged.,231
554,I have been meditating on the very great pleasurewhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”,231
555,"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired hewould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.",232
556,"Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--",232
557,“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”,233
558,“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley.,234
559,“I am all astonishment.,234
560,How long has she been such a favourite?,234
561,and pray when am I to wish youjoy?”,234
562,“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.,235
563,"A lady’simagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from loveto matrimony, in a moment.",235
564,I knew you would be wishing me joy.”,235
565,"“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter asabsolutely settled.",236
566,"You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, andof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”",236
567,"He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose toentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced herthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.",237

571,CHAPTER VII.,243
573,"Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of twothousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’sfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supplythe deficiency of his.",245
574,"Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, andhad left her four thousand pounds.",245
575,"She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to theirfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled inLondon in a respectable line of trade.",246
576,"The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a mostconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually temptedthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, andto a milliner’s shop just over the way.",247
577,"The two youngest of the family,Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothingbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morninghours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare ofnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learnsome from their aunt.",247
578,"At present, indeed, they were well supplied bothwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment inthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton wasthe head-quarters.",247
579,Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interestingintelligence.,248
580,Every day added something to their knowledge of theofficers’ names and connections.,248
581,"Their lodgings were not long a secret,and at length they began to know the officers themselves.",248
582,"Mr. Philipsvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicityunknown before.",248
583,"They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to theirmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals ofan ensign.",248
584,"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.Bennet coolly observed,--",249
585,"“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be twoof the silliest girls in the country.",250
586,"I have suspected it some time, butI am now convinced.”",250
587,"Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfectindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, andher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going thenext morning to London.",251
588,"“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be soready to think your own children silly.",252
589,"If I wished to think slightinglyof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”",252
590,"“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”",253
591,"“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”",254
592,"“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.",255
593,"Ihad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I mustso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonlyfoolish.”",255
594,"“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense oftheir father and mother.",256
595,"When they get to our age, I dare say they willnot think about officers any more than we do.",256
596,"I remember the time when Iliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at myheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thoughtColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s inhis regimentals.”",256
597,"“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and CaptainCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they firstcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”",257
598,"Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with anote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waitedfor an answer.",258

614,"“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely torain; and then you must stay all night.”",267
615,"“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure thatthey would not offer to send her home.”",268

622,"“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purposewill be answered.”",274
623,"She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horseswere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and hermother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a badday.",275

634,"“Yours, etc.”",279
635,"“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the notealoud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if sheshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit ofMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”",280

656,"She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane wereassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.",291
657,"That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in suchdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contemptfor it.",291
658,"She was received, however, very politely by them; and in theirbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there wasgood-humour and kindness.",291
659,"Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurstnothing at all.",291
660,The former was divided between admiration of thebrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as tothe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone.,291
661,The latter wasthinking only of his breakfast.,291
662,Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.,292
663,"MissBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not wellenough to leave her room.",292

671,"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and veryunwillingly said so.",294

682,Jane was by no means better.,303
683,"The sisters, on hearingthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, howshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they dislikedbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and theirindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restoredElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.",303
684,"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she couldregard with any complacency.",304
685,"His anxiety for Jane was evident, and hisattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feelingherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by theothers.",304
686,She had very little notice from any but him.,304
687,"Miss Bingley wasengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only toeat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plaindish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.",304
688,"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingleybegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.",305

693,She reallylooked almost wild.”,306
694,"“She did indeed, Louisa.",307
695,I could hardly keep my countenance.,307
696,Verynonsensical to come at all!,307
697,"Why must _she_ be scampering about thecountry, because her sister had a cold?",307
698,"Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”",307
699,"“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deepin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down tohide it not doing its office.”",308
700,"“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this wasall lost upon me.",309
701,I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably wellwhen she came into the room this morning.,309
702,Her dirty petticoat quiteescaped my notice.”,309
703,"“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I aminclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make suchan exhibition.”",310
704,“Certainly not.”,311
705,"“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone!",312
706,what could she mean byit?,312
707,"It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,a most country-town indifference to decorum.”",312
708,"“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” saidBingley.",313
709,"“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fineeyes.”",314
710,"“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” Ashort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--",315
711,"“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweetgirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.",316
712,"But with sucha father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is nochance of it.”",316
713,“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inMeryton?”,317
714,"“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”",318
715,"“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.",319
716,"“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “itwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”",320
717,"“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.",321
718,"To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.",322
719,"With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room onleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.",323
720,"She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, tilllate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, andwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should godown stairs herself.",323
721,"On entering the drawing-room, she found the wholeparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspectingthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister theexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could staybelow, with a book.",323
722,Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.,323
723,“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”,324
724,"“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards.",325
725,"She is a greatreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”",325
726,"“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “Iam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”",326
727,"“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “andI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”",327
728,"Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a tablewhere a few books were lying.",328
729,He immediately offered to fetch herothers; all that his library afforded.,328
730,"“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have morethan I ever looked into.”",329
731,Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room.,330
732,"“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have leftso small a collection of books.",331
733,"What a delightful library you have atPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”",331
734,"“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of manygenerations.”",332
735,“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buyingbooks.”,333
736,“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese.”,334
737,“Neglect!,335
738,I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place.,335
739,"Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may behalf as delightful as Pemberley.”",335
740,“I wish it may.”,336
741,"“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.",337
742,There is not afiner county in England than Derbyshire.”,337
743,"“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”",338
744,"“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”",339
745,"“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to getPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”",340
746,"Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very littleattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew nearthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldestsister, to observe the game.",341
747,“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “willshe be as tall as I am?”,342
748,“I think she will.,343
749,"She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, orrather taller.”",343
750,“How I long to see her again!,344
751,I never met with anybody who delighted meso much.,344
752,"Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplishedfor her age!",344
753,Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”,344
754,"“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are.”",345
755,“All young ladies accomplished!,346
756,"My dear Charles, what do you mean?”",346
757,"“Yes, all of them, I think.",347
758,"They all paint tables, cover screens, andnet purses.",347
759,"I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I amsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, withoutbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”",347
760,"“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “hastoo much truth.",348
761,The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.,348
762,Icannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of myacquaintance that are really accomplished.”,348
763,"“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.",349
764,"“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman.”",350
765,“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”,351
766,"“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith.",352
767,"A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides allthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the wordwill be but half deserved.”",352
768,"“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet addsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensivereading.”",353
769,“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.,354
770,I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”,354
771,“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis?”,355
772,“_I_ never saw such a woman.,356
773,"_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, andapplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”",356
774,"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.",357
775,"As allconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom.",357
776,"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “isone of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the othersex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, itsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”",358
777,"“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation.",359
778,Whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable.”,359
779,Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject.,360
780,"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, andthat she could not leave her.",361
781,"Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent forimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians.",361
782,"This she would not hear of; but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settledthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennetwere not decidedly better.",361
783,Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sistersdeclared that they were miserable.,361
784,"They solaced their wretchedness,however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief tohis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everypossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.",361
786,M^{rs} Bennet and her two youngest girls,364
788,CHAPTER IX.,367
790,"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters.",369
791,"In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have anote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form herown judgment of her situation.",369
792,"The note was immediately despatched, andits contents as quickly complied with.",369
793,"Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by hertwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.",369
794,"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have beenvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.",370
795,"Shewould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carriedhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, thinkit at all advisable.",370
796,"After sitting a little while with Jane, on MissBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour.",370
797,Bingley met them with hopesthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.,370
798,"“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer.",371
799,“She is a great deal too ill to bemoved.,371
800,Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.,371
801,We must trespassa little longer on your kindness.”,371
802,“Removed!” cried Bingley.,372
803,“It must not be thought of.,372
804,"My sister, I amsure, will not hear of her removal.”",372
805,"“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while sheremains with us.”",373
806,Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.,374
807,"“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do notknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers avast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which isalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetesttemper I ever met with.",375
808,I often tell my other girls they are nothing to_her_.,375
809,"You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospectover that gravel walk.",375
810,I do not know a place in the country that isequal to Netherfield.,375
811,"You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, Ihope, though you have but a short lease.”",375
812,"“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if Ishould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in fiveminutes.",376
813,"At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”",376
814,"“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.",377
815,"“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.",378
816,“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”,379
817,"“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seenthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”",380
818,“That is as it happens.,381
819,"It does not necessarily follow that a deep,intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”",381
820,"“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”",382
821,"“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you werea studier of character.",383
822,It must be an amusing study.”,383
823,“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.,384
824,They have atleast that advantage.”,384
825,"“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects forsuch a study.",385
826,In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society.”,385
827,"“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever.”",386
828,"“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning acountry neighbourhood.",387
829,“I assure you there is quite as much of _that_going on in the country as in town.”,387
830,"Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,turned silently away.",388
831,"Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him, continued her triumph,--",388
832,"“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, formy part, except the shops and public places.",389
833,"The country is a vast dealpleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”",389
834,"“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; andwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same.",390
835,"They have each theiradvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”",390
836,"“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition.",391
837,"But thatgentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothingat all.”",391
838,"“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for hermother.",392
839,“You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.,392
840,"He only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, whichyou must acknowledge to be true.”",392
841,"“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting withmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger.",393
842,I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”,393
843,Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep hiscountenance.,394
844,"His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towardsMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.",394
845,"Elizabeth, for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her ifCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.",394
846,"“Yes, she called yesterday with her father.",395
847,"What an agreeable man SirWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?",395
848,so much the man of fashion!,395
849,sogenteel and so easy!,395
850,He has always something to say to everybody.,395
851,_That_is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves veryimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”,395
852,“Did Charlotte dine with you?”,396
853,"“No, she would go home.",397
854,I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies.,397
855,"Formy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their ownwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.",397
856,"But everybody is tojudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, Iassure you.",397
857,It is a pity they are not handsome!,397
858,Not that _I_ thinkCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”,397
859,"“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.",398
860,"“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain.",399
861,"Lady Lucas herselfhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty.",399
862,"I do not like to boastof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybodybetter looking.",399
863,It is what everybody says.,399
864,I do not trust my ownpartiality.,399
865,"When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at mybrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that mysister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.",399
866,"But, however, he did not.",399
867,Perhaps he thought her too young.,399
868,"However, hewrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”",399
869,"“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently.",400
870,"“There hasbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.",400
871,I wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”,400
872,"“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.",401
873,"“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.",402
874,Everything nourishes what isstrong already.,402
875,"But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”",402
876,Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.,403
877,"She longed tospeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness toJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.",403
878,"Mr. Bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to becivil also, and say what the occasion required.",403
879,"She performed her part,indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage.",403
880,"Upon this signal, the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward.",403
881,"The two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that theyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.",403
882,"Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexionand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age.",404
883,"She had highanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which theattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and herown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.",404
884,"She wasvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of theball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would bethe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.",404
885,His answerto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.,404
886,"“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, whenyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day ofthe ball.",405
887,But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”,405
888,Lydia declared herself satisfied.,406
889,"“Oh yes--it would be much better towait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carterwould be at Meryton again.",406
890,"And when you have given _your_ ball,” sheadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also.",406
891,I shall tell ColonelForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”,406
892,"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returnedinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to theremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite ofall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.",407
894,CHAPTER X.,411
896,The day passed much as the day before had done.,413
897,"Mrs. Hurst and MissBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, whocontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joinedtheir party in the drawing-room.",413
898,"The loo table, however, did not appear.",413
899,"Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watchingthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention bymessages to his sister.",413
900,"Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, andMrs. Hurst was observing their game.",413
901,"Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.",414
902,"The perpetualcommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evennessof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and wasexactly in unison with her opinion of each.",414
903,“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”,415
904,He made no answer.,416
905,“You write uncommonly fast.”,417
906,“You are mistaken.,418
907,I write rather slowly.”,418
908,“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of ayear!,419
909,"Letters of business, too!",419
910,How odious I should think them!”,419
911,"“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”",420
912,“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”,421
913,"“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”",422
914,“I am afraid you do not like your pen.,423
915,Let me mend it for you.,423
916,I mendpens remarkably well.”,423
917,“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”,424
918,“How can you contrive to write so even?”,425
919,He was silent.,426
920,"“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautifullittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to MissGrantley’s.”",427
921,“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?,428
922,Atpresent I have not room to do them justice.”,428
923,"“Oh, it is of no consequence.",429
924,I shall see her in January.,429
925,"But do youalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”",429
926,"“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for meto determine.”",430
927,"“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter withease cannot write ill.”",431
928,"“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried herbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease.",432
929,He studies too muchfor words of four syllables.,432
930,"Do not you, Darcy?”",432
931,“My style of writing is very different from yours.”,433
932,"“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable.",434
933,"He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”",434
934,“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”,435
935,"“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”",436
936,"“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance ofhumility.",437
937,"It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes anindirect boast.”",437
938,“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”,438
939,"“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects inwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, youthink at least highly interesting.",439
940,"The power of doing anything withquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance.",439
941,"When you told Mrs.Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”",439
942,"“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning.",440
943,"And yet, upon my honour, Ibelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at thismoment.",440
944,"At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”",440
945,“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that youwould be gone with such celerity.,441
946,"Your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you weremounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better staytill next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably notgo--and, at another word, might stay a month.”",441
947,"“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition.",442
948,You have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself.”,442
949,"“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.",443
950,"But I amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such acircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as Icould.”",443
951,“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”,444

961,"But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”",449

963,"“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, notforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have moreweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.",451
964,"I assureyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison withmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference.",451
965,"I declare I do notknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and inparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,when he has nothing to do.”",451
966,"Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh.",452
967,"Miss Bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense.",452

978,"She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her becausehe disliked her was still more strange.",458
979,"She could only imagine, however,at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about hermore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than inany other person present.",458
980,The supposition did not pain her.,458
981,She likedhim too little to care for his approbation.,458
982,"After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by alively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing nearElizabeth, said to her,--",459

984,"She smiled, but made no answer.",461
985,"He repeated the question, with somesurprise at her silence.",461

989,“Indeed I do not dare.”,463
990,"Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at hisgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy hadnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.",464
991,"He reallybelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, heshould be in some danger.",464
992,"Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.",465
993,"She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking oftheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.",466
994,"“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery thenext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when thisdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running afterthe officers.",467

1006,At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst andElizabeth herself.,474
1007,"“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in someconfusion, lest they had been overheard.",475
1008,"“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away withouttelling us that you were coming out.”",476
1009,"Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walkby herself.",477

1012,“This walk is not wide enough for our party.,478
1013,We had better go into theavenue.”,478
1014,"But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,laughingly answered,--",479

1016,"You are charmingly grouped, and appear touncommon advantage.",480
1017,The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth.,480

1027,Their powersof conversation were considerable.,489
1028,"They could describe an entertainmentwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at theiracquaintance with spirit.",489
1029,"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps.",490
1030,"He addressedhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurstalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffusenessand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation.",490
1031,He was full of joy andattention.,490
1032,"The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest sheshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from thedoor.",490
1033,"He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.",490
1034,"Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with greatdelight.",490
1035,When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of thecard-table--but in vain.,491
1036,"She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected.",491
1037,"She assured him that no one intended to play, and thesilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her.",491
1038,"Mr.Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep.",491
1039,Darcy took up a book.,491
1040,"Miss Bingley did the same;and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets andrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with MissBennet.",491
1041,"Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she wasperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.",492
1042,"Shecould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered herquestion and read on.",492
1043,"At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant itis to spend an evening in this way!",492
1044,"I declare, after all, there is noenjoyment like reading!",492
1045,How much sooner one tires of anything than of abook!,492

1047,No one made any reply.,493
1048,"She then yawned again, threw aside her book, andcast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearingher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenlytowards him and said,--",493
1049,"“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance atNetherfield?",494
1050,"I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consultthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are notsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure.”",494
1051,"“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if hechooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settledthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall sendround my cards.”",495
1052,"“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they werecarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting.",496
1053,It would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of theday.”,496
1054,"“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not benear so much like a ball.”",497
1055,"Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked aboutthe room.",498
1056,"Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, atwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.",498
1057,"In thedesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,turning to Elizabeth, said,--",498
1058,"“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take aturn about the room.",499
1059,I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude.”,499
1060,"Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.",500
1061,Miss Bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy lookedup.,500
1062,"He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter asElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.",500
1063,"He wasdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere.",500
1064,What could he mean?,500
1065,She was dying to know what could be hismeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.,500
1066,"“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to besevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to asknothing about it.”",501
1067,"Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy inanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of histwo motives.",502
1068,"“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soonas she allowed him to speak.",503
1069,"“You either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secretaffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should becompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much betteras I sit by the fire.”",503
1070,"“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley.",504
1071,“I never heard anything soabominable.,504

1089,"“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I amnot one of _them_.",509

1129,"Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positivelyresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on thecontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and atlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfieldthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",528
1130,The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough wassaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work onJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.,529

1189,"“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.",556
1190,"“He seems to be a mostconscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, willprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be soindulgent as to let him come to us again.”",556
1191,"“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, ifhe is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person todiscourage him.”",557
1192,"“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can meanto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to hiscredit.”",558
1193,"Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for LadyCatherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and buryinghis parishioners whenever it were required.",559
1194,"“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she.",560
1195,“I cannot make him out.,560
1196,Thereis something very pompous in his style.,560
1197,And what can he mean byapologizing for being next in the entail?,560
1198,"We cannot suppose he wouldhelp it, if he could.",560
1199,"Can he be a sensible man, sir?”",560
1200,"“No, my dear; I think not.",561
1201,I have great hopes of finding him quite thereverse.,561
1202,There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in hisletter which promises well.,561
1203,I am impatient to see him.”,561
1204,"“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seemdefective.",562
1205,"The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet Ithink it is well expressed.”",562
1206,To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in anydegree interesting.,563
1207,"It was next to impossible that their cousin shouldcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they hadreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.",563
1208,"As fortheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure whichastonished her husband and daughters.",563
1209,"Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with greatpoliteness by the whole family.",564
1210,"Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but theladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in needof encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.",564
1211,"He was a tall,heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.",564
1212,"His air was grave andstately, and his manners were very formal.",564
1213,"He had not been long seatedbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family ofdaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in thisinstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did notdoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.",564
1214,"Thisgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--",564
1215,"“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it mayprove so; for else they will be destitute enough.",565
1216,Things are settled sooddly.”,565
1217,"“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”",566
1218,"“Ah, sir, I do indeed.",567
1219,"It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, youmust confess.",567
1220,"Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,I know, are all chance in this world.",567
1221,There is no knowing how estateswill go when once they come to be entailed.”,567
1222,"“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, andcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearingforward and precipitate.",568
1223,But I can assure the young ladies that I comeprepared to admire them.,568
1224,"At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,when we are better acquainted----”",568
1225,He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on eachother.,569
1226,They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration.,569
1227,"Thehall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’sheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as hisown future property.",569
1228,"The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of itscookery was owing.",569
1229,"But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assuredhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a goodcook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.",569
1230,He beggedpardon for having displeased her.,569
1231,In a softened tone she declaredherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about aquarter of an hour.,569
1233,CHAPTER XIV,573
1235,"During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servantswere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with hisguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him toshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.",575
1236,"LadyCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for hiscomfort, appeared very remarkable.",575
1237,Mr. Bennet could not have chosenbetter.,575
1238,Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.,575
1239,"The subject elevated himto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspecthe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in aperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himselfexperienced from Lady Catherine.",575
1240,She had been graciously pleased toapprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour ofpreaching before her.,575
1241,"She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool ofquadrille in the evening.",575
1242,"Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by manypeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.",575
1243,"She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; shemade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of theneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week ortwo to visit his relations.",575
1244,"She had even condescended to advise him tomarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and hadonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectlyapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafedto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.",575
1245,"“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and Idare say she is a very agreeable woman.",576
1246,It is a pity that great ladiesin general are not more like her.,576
1247,"Does she live near you, sir?”",576
1248,"“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lanefrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”",577
1249,"“I think you said she was a widow, sir?",578
1250,has she any family?”,578
1251,"“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of veryextensive property.”",579
1252,"“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off thanmany girls.",580
1253,And what sort of young lady is she?,580
1254,Is she handsome?”,580
1255,"“She is a most charming young lady, indeed.",581
1256,"Lady Catherine herself saysthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to thehandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marksthe young woman of distinguished birth.",581
1257,"She is unfortunately of a sicklyconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in manyaccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I aminformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who stillresides with them.",581
1258,"But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescendsto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”",581
1259,“Has she been presented?,582
1260,I do not remember her name among the ladies atcourt.”,582
1261,"“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprivedthe British Court of its brightest ornament.",583
1262,Her Ladyship seemed pleasedwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion tooffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable toladies.,583
1263,"I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that hercharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the mostelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned byher.",583
1264,"These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, andit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound topay.”",583
1265,"“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for youthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.",584
1266,"May I askwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of themoment, or are the result of previous study?”",584
1267,"“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though Isometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegantcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish togive them as unstudied an air as possible.”",585
1268,Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered.,586
1269,"His cousin was as absurdas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partnerin his pleasure.",586
1270,"By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was gladto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,glad to invite him",587
1272,“Protestedthat he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94],589
1273,to read aloud to the ladies.,590
1274,"Mr. Collins readily assented, and a bookwas produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to befrom a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,protested that he never read novels.",590
1275,"Kitty stared at him, and Lydiaexclaimed.",590
1276,"Other books were produced, and after some deliberation hechose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; andbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, sheinterrupted him with,--",590
1277,"“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning awayRichard?",591
1278,"and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.",591
1279,My aunt told meso herself on Saturday.,591
1280,"I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear moreabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”",591
1281,"Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--",592
1282,"“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by booksof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.",593
1283,"It amazesme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous tothem as instruction.",593
1284,But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”,593
1285,"Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist atbackgammon.",594
1286,"Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he actedvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.",594
1287,"Mrs.Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’sinterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he wouldresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore hisyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as anyaffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and preparedfor backgammon.",594
1289,CHAPTER XV.,598
1291,"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature hadbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part ofhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate andmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, hehad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any usefulacquaintance.",600
1292,"The subjection in which his father had brought him up hadgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a gooddeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living inretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpectedprosperity.",600
1293,"A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine deBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which hefelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as aclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture ofpride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",600
1294,"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended tomarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he hada wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he foundthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.",601
1295,"This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’sestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility andsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his ownpart.",601
1296,His plan did not vary on seeing them.,602
1297,"Miss Bennet’s lovely faceconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of whatwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settledchoice.",602
1298,"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarterof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, aconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturallyto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found atLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and generalencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.",602
1299,"“As toher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she couldnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her tohint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”",602
1300,Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soondone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.,603
1301,"Elizabeth, equallynext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.",603
1302,"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon havetwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak ofthe day before, was now high in her good graces.",604
1303,"Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sisterexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followedhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged withone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.",605
1304,Suchdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.,605
1305,"In his library he had beenalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he toldElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in thehouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in theirwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walkerthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, andgo.",605
1306,"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of hiscousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.",606
1307,The attention ofthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.,606
1308,"Their eyeswere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, andnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin ina shop window, could recall them.",606
1309,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whomthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walkingwith an officer on the other side of the way.",607
1310,"The officer was the veryMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, andhe bowed as they passed.",607
1311,"All were struck with the stranger’s air, allwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possibleto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wantingsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained thepavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the samespot.",607
1312,"Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission tointroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the daybefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission intheir corps.",607
1313,This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wantedonly regimentals to make him completely charming.,607
1314,"His appearance wasgreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a finecountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.",607
1315,"The introductionwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--areadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and thewhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley wereseen riding down the street.",607
1316,"On distinguishing the ladies of the groupthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usualcivilities.",607
1317,"Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet theprincipal object.",607
1318,"He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn onpurpose to inquire after her.",607
1319,"Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, andwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when theywere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabethhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.",607
1320,"Both changed colour,one looked white, the other red.",607
1321,"Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.",607
1322,What could be the meaning of it?,607
1323,It was impossible to imagine; it wasimpossible not to long to know.,607
1324,"In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed whatpassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",608
1325,"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door ofMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’spressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding theinvitation.",609
1326,"Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, fromtheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerlyexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their owncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, ifshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who hadtold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimedtowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him.",610
1327,"She received him withher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance withher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might bejustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him toher notice.",610
1328,"Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of goodbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end toby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, shecould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny hadbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’scommission in the ----shire.",610
1329,"She had been watching him the last hour,she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickhamappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of theofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses thenext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbournwould come in the evening.",610
1330,"This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philipsprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lotterytickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.",610
1331,"The prospect of suchdelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.",610
1332,"Mr.Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.",610
1333,"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen passbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either orboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain suchbehaviour than her sister.",611
1334,Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.Philips’s manners and politeness.,612
1335,"He protested that, except LadyCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; forshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had evenpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, althoughutterly unknown to her before.",612
1336,"Something, he supposed, might beattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with somuch attention in the whole course of his life.",612
1338,CHAPTER XVI.,616
1340,"As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with theiraunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet fora single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coachconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and thegirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then inthe house.",618
1341,"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so muchstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared hemight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlourat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey muchgratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosingswas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to thedescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and foundthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt allthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparisonwith the housekeeper’s room.",619
1342,"In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and theimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until thegentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentivelistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what sheheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours assoon as she could.",620
1343,"To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examinetheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, theinterval of waiting appeared very long.",620
1344,"It was over at last, however.",620
1345,"The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinkingof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.",620
1346,"Theofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; butMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, andwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.",620
1348,“The officers of the ----shire”,622
1350,"Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye wasturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seatedhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell intoconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on theprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by theskill of the speaker.",624
1351,"With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and theofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the youngladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kindlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantlysupplied with coffee and muffin.",625
1352,"When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,in return, by sitting down to whist.",626
1353,"“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad toimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was verythankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",627
1354,"Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was hereceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.",628
1355,"At first thereseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a mostdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making betsand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.",628
1356,"Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was thereforeat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.",628
1357,She dared not evenmention that gentleman.,628
1358,"Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedlyrelieved.",628
1359,Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.,628
1360,"He inquired how farNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked ina hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.",628
1361,"“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subjectdrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, Iunderstand.”",629
1362,"“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one.",630
1363,A clear tenthousand per annum.,630
1364,"You could not have met with a person more capable ofgiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have beenconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”",630
1365,Elizabeth could not but look surprised.,631
1366,"“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, afterseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meetingyesterday.",632
1367,Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”,632
1368,"“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly.",633
1369,"“I have spentfour days in the same house with him, and I think him verydisagreeable.”",633
1370,"“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his beingagreeable or otherwise.",634
1371,I am not qualified to form one.,634
1372,I have known himtoo long and too well to be a fair judge.,634
1373,It is impossible for _me_ tobe impartial.,634
1374,"But I believe your opinion of him would in generalastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so stronglyanywhere else.",634
1375,Here you are in your own family.”,634
1376,"“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in theneighbourhood, except Netherfield.",635
1377,He is not at all liked inHertfordshire.,635
1378,Everybody is disgusted with his pride.,635
1379,You will not findhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”,635
1380,"“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a shortinterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyondtheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.",636
1381,"Theworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by hishigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”",636
1382,"“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be anill-tempered man.”",637
1383,Wickham only shook his head.,638
1384,"“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he islikely to be in this country much longer.”",639
1385,“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when Iwas at Netherfield.,640
1386,I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire willnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”,640
1387,“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.,641
1388,If _he_wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go.,641
1389,"We are not on friendly terms,and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason foravoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense ofvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.",641
1390,"His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best menthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never bein company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by athousand tender recollections.",641
1391,"His behaviour to myself has beenscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything andeverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing thememory of his father.”",641
1392,"Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened withall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.",642
1393,"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, theneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that hehad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle butvery intelligible gallantry.",643
1394,"“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.",644
1395,"I know it to be amost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted mefurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very greatattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.",644
1396,"Society, I own, is necessary to me.",644
1397,"I have been a disappointed man, andmy spirits will not bear solitude.",644
1398,I _must_ have employment and society.,644
1399,"A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances havenow made it eligible.",644
1400,"The church _ought_ to have been my profession--Iwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been inpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman wewere speaking of just now.”",644
1401,“Indeed!”,645
1402,“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the bestliving in his gift.,646
1403,"He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.",646
1404,I cannot do justice to his kindness.,646
1405,"He meant to provide for me amply,and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was givenelsewhere.”",646
1406,“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be?,647
1407,How could hiswill be disregarded?,647
1408,Why did not you seek legal redress?”,647
1409,“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as togive me no hope from law.,648
1410,"A man of honour could not have doubted theintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merelyconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claimto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.",648
1411,"Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as Iwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and noless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really doneanything to deserve to lose it.",648
1412,"I have a warm unguarded temper, and Imay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, toofreely.",648
1413,I can recall nothing worse.,648
1414,"But the fact is, that we are verydifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”",648
1415,“This is quite shocking!,649
1416,He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”,649
1417,“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.,650
1418,"Till Ican forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”",650
1419,"Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer thanever as he expressed them.",651
1420,"“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?",652
1421,what canhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”,652
1422,"“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot butattribute in some measure to jealousy.",653
1423,"Had the late Mr. Darcy liked meless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommonattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.",653
1424,He hadnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sortof preference which was often given me.”,653
1425,"“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likedhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to bedespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him ofdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity asthis!”",654
1426,"After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability ofhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.",655
1427,His dispositionmust be dreadful.”,655
1428,"“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ canhardly be just to him.”",656
1429,"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “Totreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of hisfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose verycountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herselfwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion fromchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closestmanner.”",657
1430,"“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatestpart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.",658
1431,"_My_father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of useto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of thePemberley property.",658
1432,"He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a mostintimate, confidential friend.",658
1433,"Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him avoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt itto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”",658
1434,“How strange!” cried Elizabeth.,659
1435,“How abominable!,659
1436,I wonder that the verypride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you.,659
1437,"If from no bettermotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--fordishonesty I must call it.”",659
1438,"“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may betraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.",660
1439,It hasconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.,660
1440,But we are noneof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were strongerimpulses even than pride.”,660
1441,“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”,661
1442,"“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his moneyfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve thepoor.",662
1443,"Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what hisfather was, have done this.",662
1444,"Not to appear to disgrace his family, todegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of thePemberley House, is a powerful motive.",662
1445,"He has also _brotherly_ pride,which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind andcareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried upas the most attentive and best of brothers.”",662
1446,“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”,663
1447,He shook his head.,664
1448,“I wish I could call her amiable.,664
1449,"It gives me pain tospeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, veryproud.",664
1450,"As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fondof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.",664
1451,But she isnothing to me now.,664
1452,"She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,and, I understand, highly accomplished.",664
1453,"Since her father’s death herhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends hereducation.”",664
1454,"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could nothelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--",665
1455,“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley.,666
1456,"How can Mr. Bingley,who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,be in friendship with such a man?",666
1457,How can they suit each other?,666
1458,Do youknow Mr. Bingley?”,666
1459,“Not at all.”,667
1460,"“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.",668
1461,He cannot know what Mr.Darcy is.”,668
1462,“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.,669
1463,He does notwant abilities.,669
1464,He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worthhis while.,669
1465,"Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is avery different man from what he is to the less prosperous.",669
1466,"His pridenever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowingsomething for fortune and figure.”",669
1467,"The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered roundthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousinElizabeth and Mrs. Philips.",670
1468,The usual inquiries as to his success weremade by the latter.,670
1469,"It had not been very great; he had lost every point;but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assuredher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would notmake herself uneasy.",670
1470,"“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to acard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily Iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.",671
1471,"Thereare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to LadyCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters.”",671
1472,"Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins fora few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationswere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.",672
1473,"“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him aliving.",673
1474,"I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hernotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”",673
1475,“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcywere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”,674
1476,"“No, indeed, I did not.",675
1477,I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’sconnections.,675
1478,I never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday.”,675
1479,"“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”",676
1480,"This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor MissBingley.",677
1481,"Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless heraffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were alreadyself-destined to another.",677
1482,“Mr.,678
1483,"Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and herdaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of herLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite ofher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”",678
1484,"“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I havenot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never likedher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.",679
1485,"She has thereputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believeshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part fromher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, whochooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding ofthe first class.”",679
1486,"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, andthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper putan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.Wickham’s attentions.",680
1487,"There could be no conversation in the noise ofMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him toeverybody.",680
1488,"Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, donegracefully.",680
1489,Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.,680
1490,"She couldthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, allthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name asthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.",680
1491,"Lydiatalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and thefish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. andMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his lossesat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearingthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well managebefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.",680
1493,     “delighted to see their dear friend again”],683
1494,CHAPTER XVII.,685
1496,"Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.Wickham and herself.",687
1497,Jane listened with astonishment and concern: sheknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.,687
1498,"Thepossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough tointerest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to bedone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, andthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not beotherwise explained.",687
1499,"“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way orother, of which we can form no idea.",688
1500,Interested people have perhapsmisrepresented each to the other.,688
1501,"It is, in short, impossible for us toconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,without actual blame on either side.”",688
1502,"“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say inbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in thebusiness?",689
1503,"Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill ofsomebody.”",689
1504,"“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of myopinion.",690
1505,"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful lightit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such amanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for.",690
1506,It isimpossible.,690
1507,"No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for hischaracter, could be capable of it.",690
1508,Can his most intimate friends be soexcessively deceived in him?,690
1509,Oh no.”,690
1510,"“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than thatMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me lastnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.",691
1511,"If it be notso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.",691
1512,"Besides, there was truth in his looks.”",691
1513,"“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing.",692
1514,One does not know what tothink.”,692
1515,“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”,693
1516,"But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer whenthe affair became public.",694
1517,"The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where thisconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whomthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give theirpersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which wasfixed for the following Tuesday.",695
1518,"The two ladies were delighted to seetheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, andrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since theirseparation.",695
1519,"To the rest of the family they paid little attention;avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,and nothing at all to the others.",695
1520,"They were soon gone again, rising fromtheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, andhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.",695
1521,The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to everyfemale of the family.,696
1522,"Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given incompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered byreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of aceremonious card.",696
1523,"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in thesociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; andElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s lookand behaviour.",696
1524,"The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia dependedless on any single event, or any particular person; for though theyeach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ballwas, at any rate, a ball.",696
1525,And even Mary could assure her family that shehad no disinclination for it.,696
1526,"“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough.",697
1527,Ithink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.,697
1528,Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those whoconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable foreverybody.”,697
1529,"Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she didnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help askinghim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if hedid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’samusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained noscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing todance.",698
1530,"“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball ofthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, canhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancingmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my faircousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity ofsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; apreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the rightcause, and not to any disrespect for her.”",699
1531,Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.,700
1532,She had fully proposed beingengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collinsinstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed.,700
1533,"There was no helpfor it, however.",700
1534,"Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforcedelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with asgood a grace as she could.",700
1535,"She was not the better pleased with hisgallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.",700
1536,"It now firststruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy ofbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form aquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.",700
1537,"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasingcivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at acompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished thangratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long beforeher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriagewas exceedingly agreeable to _her_.",700
1538,"Elizabeth, however, did not chooseto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be theconsequence of any reply.",700
1539,"Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.",700
1540,"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, theyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there wassuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.",701
1541,"Noaunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-rosesfor Netherfield were got by proxy.",701
1542,"Even Elizabeth might have found sometrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvementof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance onTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Mondayendurable to Kitty and Lydia.",701
1544,CHAPTER XVIII.,705
1546,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked invain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, adoubt of his being present had never occurred to her.",707
1547,The certainty ofmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections thatmight not unreasonably have alarmed her.,707
1548,"She had dressed with more thanusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of allthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more thanmight be won in the course of the evening.",707
1549,"But in an instant arose thedreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’spleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though thiswas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, andwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on businessthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significantsmile,--",707
1550,"“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, ifhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”",708
1551,"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught byElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable forWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feelingof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediatedisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility tothe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.",709
1552,"Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.",709
1553,"Shewas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned awaywith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even inspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",709
1554,"But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospectof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on herspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom shehad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntarytransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to herparticular notice.",710
1555,"The two first dances, however, brought a return ofdistress: they were dances of mortification.",710
1556,"Mr. Collins, awkward andsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrongwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which adisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.",710
1557,The moment of herrelease from him was ecstasy.,710
1558,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking ofWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.",711
1559,"When those danceswere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation withher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who tookher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, withoutknowing what she did, she accepted him.",711
1560,"He walked away againimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence ofmind: Charlotte tried to console her.",711
1561,“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”,712
1562,“Heaven forbid!,713
1563,_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!,713
1564,To finda man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!,713
1565,Do not wish me such anevil.”,713
1566,"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim herhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be asimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the eyes of a man often times his consequence.",714
1567,"Elizabeth made noanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to whichshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, andreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.",714
1568,"They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began toimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, atfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that itwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,she made some slight observation on the dance.",714
1569,"He replied, and was againsilent.",714
1570,"After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,with--",714
1571,"“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.",715
1572,"_I_ talked about thedance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of theroom, or the number of couples.”",715
1573,"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should besaid.",716
1574,“Very well; that reply will do for the present.,717
1575,"Perhaps, by-and-by, Imay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but_now_ we may be silent.”",717
1576,"“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”",718
1577,“Sometimes.,719
1578,"One must speak a little, you know.",719
1579,"It would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible.”",719
1580,"“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine?”",720
1581,"“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds.",721
1582,"We are each of an unsocial,taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down toposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”",721
1583,"“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”said he.",722
1584,"“How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.",722
1585,"_You_think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”",722
1586,“I must not decide on my own performance.”,723
1587,"He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very oftenwalk to Meryton.",724
1588,"She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resistthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had justbeen forming a new acquaintance.”",724
1589,The effect was immediate.,725
1590,"A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread hisfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herselffor her own weakness, could not go on.",725
1591,"At length Darcy spoke, and in aconstrained manner said,--",725
1592,“Mr.,726
1593,"Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,is less certain.”",726
1594,"“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from allhis life.”",727
1595,"Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.",728
1596,"Atthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner.",728
1597,"“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such verysuperior dancing is not often seen.",729
1598,It is evident that you belong to thefirst circles.,729
1599,"Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does notdisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancingat her sister and Bingley), shall take place.",729
1600,What congratulations willthen flow in!,729
1601,"I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.",729
1602,"You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse ofthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”",729
1604,“Such very superior dancing is notoften seen.”,731
1606,"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but SirWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and hiseyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley andJane, who were dancing together.",733
1607,"Recovering himself, however, shortly,he turned to his partner, and said,--",733
1608,“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talkingof.”,734
1609,“I do not think we were speaking at all.,735
1610,Sir William could not haveinterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say forthemselves.,735
1611,"We have tried two or three subjects already without success,and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”",735
1612,"“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.",736
1613,"“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the samefeelings.”",737
1614,"“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least beno want of subject.",738
1615,We may compare our different opinions.”,738
1616,“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full ofsomething else.”,739
1617,"“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,with a look of doubt.",740
1618,"“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for herthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appearedby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, wasunappeasable.",741
1619,"You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _beingcreated_?”",741
1620,"“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.",742
1621,“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”,743
1622,“I hope not.”,744
1623,"“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,to be secure of judging properly at first.”",745
1624,“May I ask to what these questions tend?”,746
1625,"“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouringto shake off her gravity.",747
1626,“I am trying to make it out.”,747
1627,“And what is your success?”,748
1628,She shook her head.,749
1629,“I do not get on at all.,749
1630,I hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”,749
1631,"“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may varygreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you werenot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason tofear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”",750
1632,"“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have anotheropportunity.”",751
1633,"“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.",752
1634,"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted insilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; forin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger againstanother.",752
1635,"They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--",753
1636,"“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?",754
1637,"Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousandquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among hisother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.Darcy’s steward.",754
1638,"Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to giveimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s usinghim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been alwaysremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in amost infamous manner.",754
1639,"I do not know the particulars, but I know verywell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bearto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought hecould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, hewas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.",754
1640,"His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, andI wonder how he could presume to do it.",754
1641,"I pity you, Miss Eliza, for thisdiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering hisdescent, one could not expect much better.”",754
1642,"“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothingworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I canassure you, he informed me himself.”",755
1643,"“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.",756
1644,“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”,756
1645,“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself.,757
1646,“You are much mistaken ifyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.,757
1647,"I seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of Bingley.",757
1648,"Jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.",757
1649,"Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitudefor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gaveway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.",757
1650,"“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than hersister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.",758
1651,"But perhaps you havebeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which caseyou may be sure of my pardon.”",758
1652,"“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothingsatisfactory to tell you.",759
1653,"Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of hishistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which haveprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced thatMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he hasreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as hissister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.",759
1654,"I amafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’sregard.”",759
1655,“Mr.,760
1656,Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”,760
1657,“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”,761
1658,“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.,762
1659,I amperfectly satisfied.,762
1660,But what does he say of the living?”,762
1661,"“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heardthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left tohim _conditionally_ only.”",763
1662,"“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.",764
1663,"Mr.Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learntthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think ofboth gentlemen as I did before.”",764
1664,"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment.",765
1665,"Elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained ofBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it.",765
1666,"On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrewto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her lastpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunateas to make a most important discovery.",765
1667,"“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is nowin the room a near relation to my patroness.",766
1668,"I happened to overhear thegentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours ofthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,Lady Catherine.",766
1669,How wonderfully these sort of things occur!,766
1670,Who wouldhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine deBourgh in this assembly!,766
1671,"I am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.",766
1672,My totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”,766
1673,“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”,767
1674,“Indeed I am.,768
1675,I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.,768
1676,I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_.,768
1677,It will be in my power toassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”,768
1678,"Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring himthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction asan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that itwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior inconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.",769
1679,"Mr. Collins listened to her withthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceasedspeaking, replied thus,--",769
1680,"“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of yourexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide differencebetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and thosewhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I considerthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rankin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at thesame time maintained.",770
1681,"You must, therefore, allow me to follow thedictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to performwhat I look on as a point of duty.",770
1682,"Pardon me for neglecting to profit byyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by educationand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady likeyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whosereception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment atbeing so addressed was very evident.",770
1683,"Her cousin prefaced his speech witha solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as ifhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see himexpose himself to such a man.",770
1684,"Mr. Darcy was eyeing him withunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,replied with an air of distant civility.",770
1685,"Mr. Collins, however, was notdiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemedabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at theend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.Collins then returned to Elizabeth.",770
1686,"“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with myreception.",771
1687,Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.,771
1688,"He answeredme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.",771
1689,It was really a veryhandsome thought.,771
1690,"Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",771
1691,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to madeher perhaps almost as happy as Jane.",772
1692,"She saw her in idea settled in thatvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection couldbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouringeven to like Bingley’s two sisters.",772
1693,"Her mother’s thoughts she plainlysaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,lest she might hear too much.",772
1694,"When they sat down to supper, therefore,she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them withinone of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother wastalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothingelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.Bingley.",772
1695,"It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapableof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.",772
1696,"His being sucha charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such acomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to becertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.",772
1697,"Itwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, asJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able toconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she mightnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked.",772
1698,"It was necessaryto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on suchoccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.",772
1699,"Sheconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equallyfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was nochance of it.",772
1700,"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’swords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audiblewhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that thechief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.",773
1701,Hermother only scolded her for being nonsensical.,773
1702,"“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?",774
1703,I amsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to saynothing _he_ may not like to hear.”,774
1704,"“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower.",775
1705,What advantage can it be to youto offend Mr. Darcy?,775
1706,You will never recommend yourself to his friend byso doing.”,775
1707,"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.",776
1708,Her mother wouldtalk of her views in the same intelligible tone.,776
1709,Elizabeth blushed andblushed again with shame and vexation.,776
1710,"She could not help frequentlyglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of whatshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she wasconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.",776
1711,The expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity.,776
1712,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.",777
1713,Elizabeth now began to revive.,777
1714,"But not long was the interval oftranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and shehad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,preparing to oblige the company.",777
1715,"By many significant looks and silententreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof ofcomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such anopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.",777
1716,"Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; andshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatiencewhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receivingamongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might beprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minutebegan another.",777
1717,"Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;her voice was weak, and her manner affected.",777
1718,Elizabeth was in agonies.,777
1719,She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedlytalking to Bingley.,777
1720,"She looked at his two sisters, and saw them makingsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,impenetrably grave.",777
1721,"She looked at her father to entreat hisinterference, lest Mary should be singing all night.",777
1722,"He took the hint,and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--",777
1723,"“That will do extremely well, child.",778
1724,You have delighted us long enough.,778
1725,Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”,778
1726,"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; andElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraidher anxiety had done no good.",779
1727,Others of the party were now applied to.,779
1728,"“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, Ishould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with anair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectlycompatible with the profession of a clergyman.",780
1729,"I do not mean, however,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time tomusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.",780
1730,Therector of a parish has much to do.,780
1731,"In the first place, he must make suchan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and notoffensive to his patron.",780
1732,"He must write his own sermons; and the timethat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the careand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from makingas comfortable as possible.",780
1733,"And I do not think it of light importancethat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towardseverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.",780
1734,"Icannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man whoshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybodyconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concludedhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half theroom.",780
1735,"Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins forhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to LadyLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",780
1736,"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement toexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it wouldhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, orfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sisterthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that hisfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which hemust have witnessed.",781
1737,"That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, shouldhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; andshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, orthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",781
1738,The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.,782
1739,"She was teased byMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though hecould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of herpower to dance with others.",782
1740,"In vain did she entreat him to stand up withsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in theroom.",782
1741,"He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferentto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommendhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remainingclose to her the whole evening.",782
1742,There was no arguing upon such aproject.,782
1743,"She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, whooften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversationto herself.",782
1744,"She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:though often standing within a very short distance of her, quitedisengaged, he never came near enough to speak.",783
1745,"She felt it to be theprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced init.",783
1746,"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by amanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of anhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see howheartily they were wished away by some of the family.",784
1747,"Mrs. Hurst and hersister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, andwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.",784
1748,"They repulsedevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw alanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the longspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and hissisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality andpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.",784
1749,Darcy saidnothing at all.,784
1750,"Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",784
1751,"Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from therest, and talked only to each other.",784
1752,"Elizabeth preserved as steady asilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was toomuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.",784
1753,"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressinglycivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; andaddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happyhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,without the ceremony of a formal invitation.",785
1754,"Bingley was all gratefulpleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity ofwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged togo the next day for a short time.",785
1755,"Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under thedelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations ofsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedlysee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or fourmonths.",786
1756,"Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thoughtwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",786
1757,"Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though theman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of eachwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",786
1759,     “to assure you in the most animated language”],789
1760,CHAPTER XIX.,791
1762,The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.,793
1763,Mr. Collins made hisdeclaration in form.,793
1764,"Having resolved to do it without loss of time, ashis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and havingno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at themoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all theobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business.",793
1765,"On findingMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soonafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--",793
1766,"“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in thecourse of this morning?”",794
1767,"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.Bennet instantly answered,--",795
1768,“Oh dear!,796
1769,"Yes, certainly.",796
1770,I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sureshe can have no objection.,796
1771,"Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” Andgathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabethcalled out,--",796
1772,"“Dear ma’am, do not go.",797
1773,I beg you will not go.,797
1774,Mr. Collins must excuseme.,797
1775,He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.,797
1776,I amgoing away myself.”,797
1777,"“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.",798
1778,"I desire you will stay where you are.” Andupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, aboutto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearingMr. Collins.”",798
1779,"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’sconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get itover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and triedto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were dividedbetween distress and diversion.",799
1780,"Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and assoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--",799
1781,"“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far fromdoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.",800
1782,Youwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this littleunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respectedmother’s permission for this address.,800
1783,"You can hardly doubt the purportof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you todissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.",800
1784,Almost assoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of myfuture life.,800
1785,"But before I am run away with by my feelings on thissubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons formarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the designof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”",800
1786,"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run awaywith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could notuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, andhe continued,--",801
1787,"“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will addvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought tohave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of callingpatroness.",802
1788,Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unaskedtoo!),802
1789,"on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before Ileft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson wasarranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr.",802
1790,"Collins, youmust marry.",802
1791,A clergyman like you must marry.,802
1792,"Choose properly, choose agentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a smallincome go a good way.",802
1793,This is my advice.,802
1794,"Find such a woman as soon asyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by theway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice andkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of theadvantages in my power to offer.",802
1795,"You will find her manners beyondanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must beacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respectwhich her rank will inevitably excite.",802
1796,"Thus much for my generalintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my viewswere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where Iassure you there are many amiable young women.",802
1797,"But the fact is, thatbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honouredfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfymyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, thatthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholyevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not befor several years.",802
1798,"This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and Iflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.",802
1799,And now nothingremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of theviolence of my affection.,802
1800,"To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, andshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am wellaware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand poundsin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’sdecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.",802
1801,"On that head,therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself thatno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”",802
1802,It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.,803
1803,"“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried.",804
1804,“You forget that I have made noanswer.,804
1805,Let me do it without further loss of time.,804
1806,Accept my thanks forthe compliment you are paying me.,804
1807,"I am very sensible of the honour ofyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than declinethem.”",804
1808,"“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of thehand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of theman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for theirfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even athird time.",805
1809,"I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you havejust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”",805
1810,"“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather anextraordinary one after my declaration.",806
1811,I do assure you that I am notone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are sodaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a secondtime.,806
1812,I am perfectly serious in my refusal.,806
1813,"You could not make _me_happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world whowould make _you_ so.",806
1814,"Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, Iam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for thesituation.”",806
1815,"“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at alldisapprove of you.",807
1816,"And you may be certain that when I have the honour ofseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,economy, and other amiable qualifications.”",807
1817,"“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.",808
1818,"You mustgive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment ofbelieving what I say.",808
1819,"I wish you very happy and very rich, and byrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",808
1820,"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of yourfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbournestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.",808
1821,"This matter may beconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thusspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thusaddressed her,--",808
1822,"“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, Ishall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because Iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on thefirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character.”",809
1823,"“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle meexceedingly.",810
1824,"If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way asmay convince you of its being one.”",810
1825,"“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that yourrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course.",811
1826,"My reasons forbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my handis unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offerwould be any other than highly desirable.",811
1827,"My situation in life, myconnections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to yourown, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it intofurther consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it isby no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.",811
1828,"Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undothe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.",811
1829,"As I must,therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, Ishall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love bysuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”",811
1830,"“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kindof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.",812
1831,I wouldrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.,812
1832,"I thank youagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, butto accept them is absolutely impossible.",812
1833,My feelings in every respectforbid it.,812
1834,Can I speak plainer?,812
1835,"Do not consider me now as an elegantfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking thetruth from her heart.”",812
1836,"“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkwardgallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable.”",813
1837,"To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make noreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if hepersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.",814
1839,CHAPTER XX.,818
1841,"Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of hissuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibuleto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open thedoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than sheentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself inwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.",820
1842,"Mr. Collinsreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since therefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flowfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.",820
1843,"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have beenglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,and could not help saying so.",821
1844,"“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall bebrought to reason.",822
1845,I will speak to her about it myself directly.,822
1846,"She isa very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; butI will _make_ her know it.”",822
1847,"“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if sheis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, whonaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.",823
1848,"If, therefore, sheactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not toforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects oftemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”",823
1849,"“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.",824
1850,“Lizzy isonly headstrong in such matters as these.,824
1851,In everything else she is asgood-natured a girl as ever lived.,824
1852,"I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, andwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”",824
1853,"She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to herhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--",825
1854,"“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.",826
1855,"You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she willnot have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind andnot have _her_.”",826
1856,"Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed themon her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered byher communication.",827
1857,"“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she hadfinished her speech.",828
1858,“Of what are you talking?”,828
1859,“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.,829
1860,"Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”",829
1861,“And what am I to do on the occasion?,830
1862,It seems a hopeless business.”,830
1863,“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.,831
1864,Tell her that you insist upon hermarrying him.”,831
1865,“Let her be called down.,832
1866,She shall hear my opinion.”,832
1867,"Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to thelibrary.",833
1868,"“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared.",834
1869,“I have sent foryou on an affair of importance.,834
1870,I understand that Mr. Collins has madeyou an offer of marriage.,834
1871,Is it true?”,834
1872,Elizabeth replied that it was.,835
1873,“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”,836
1874,"“I have, sir.”",837
1875,“Very well.,838
1876,We now come to the point.,838
1877,Your mother insists upon youraccepting it.,838
1878,"Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”",838
1879,"“Yes, or I will never see her again.”",839
1880,"“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.",840
1881,From this day you mustbe a stranger to one of your parents.,840
1882,"Your mother will never see youagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you againif you _do_.”",840
1883,"Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded theaffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",841
1884,"“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?",842
1885,You promised meto _insist_ upon her marrying him.”,842
1886,"“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.",843
1887,"First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on thepresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room.",843
1888,I shall be glad to have thelibrary to myself as soon as may be.”,843
1889,"Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, didMrs. Bennet give up the point.",844
1890,She talked to Elizabeth again and again;coaxed and threatened her by turns.,844
1891,"She endeavoured to secure Jane inher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declinedinterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, andsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.",844
1892,"Though her mannervaried, however, her determination never did.",844
1893,"Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.",845
1894,"He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousincould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no otherway.",845
1895,His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of herdeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.,845
1896,"While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spendthe day with them.",846
1897,"She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying toher, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is suchfun here!",846
1898,What do you think has happened this morning?,846
1899,"Mr. Collins hasmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”",846
1901,     “they entered the breakfast room”],848
1902,"Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered thebreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began onthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreatingher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of herfamily.",849
1903,"“Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,nobody feels for my poor nerves.”",849
1904,Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.,850
1905,"“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned asmay be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided shecan have her own way.",851
1906,"But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take itinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who isto maintain you when your father is dead.",851
1907,_I_ shall not be able to keepyou--and so I warn you.,851
1908,I have done with you from this very day.,851
1909,"I toldyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,and you will find me as good as my word.",851
1910,I have no pleasure in talkingto undutiful children.,851
1911,"Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talkingto anybody.",851
1912,People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can haveno great inclination for talking.,851
1913,Nobody can tell what I suffer!,851
1914,But itis always so.,851
1915,Those who do not complain are never pitied.”,851
1916,"Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that anyattempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.",852
1917,"She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them tillthey were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more statelythan usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--",852
1918,"“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, andlet Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”",853
1919,"Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, butLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries afterherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a littlecuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretendingnot to hear.",854
1920,In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projectedconversation:--,854
1921,"“Oh, Mr. Collins!”",855
1922,"“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.",856
1923,"Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked hisdispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.",856
1924,"Resignation toinevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young manwho has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, Itrust, I am resigned.",856
1925,"Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of mypositive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for Ihave often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when theblessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.",856
1926,"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to yourfamily, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to yourdaughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet thecompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.",856
1927,"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted mydismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are allliable to error.",856
1928,I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.,856
1929,"My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with dueconsideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”",856
1931,CHAPTER XXI.,860
1933,"The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, andElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.",862
1934,"As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, notby embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but bystiffness of manner and resentful silence.",862
1935,"He scarcely ever spoke toher; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, andespecially to her friend.",862
1936,The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or illhealth.,863
1937,Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.,863
1938,"Elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it.",863
1939,"He was always to have gone onSaturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.",863
1940,"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickhamwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.",864
1941,"He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to theiraunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody werewell talked over.",864
1942,"To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.",864
1943,"“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meetMr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for somany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”",865
1944,"She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civillybestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back withthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.",866
1945,His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.,866
1948,"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it camefrom Netherfield, and was opened immediately.",869
1949,"The envelope contained asheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’sfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change asshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.",869
1950,"Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried tojoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: butElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attentioneven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs.",869
1951,"When theyhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This isfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.",869
1952,"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their wayto town; and without any intention of coming back again.",869
1953,You shall hearwhat she says.”,869
1954,"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the informationof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.Hurst had a house.",870
1955,"The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend toregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, mydearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy manyreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in themeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and mostunreserved correspondence.",870
1956,"I depend on you for that.’” To thesehigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility ofdistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, shesaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that theirabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and asto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must sooncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.",870
1957,"“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not beable to see your friends before they leave the country.",871
1958,"But may we nothope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looksforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightfulintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greatersatisfaction as sisters?",871
1959,Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London bythem.”,871
1960,“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return intoHertfordshire this winter.,872
1961,I will read it to you.,872
1962,"“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business whichtook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as weare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that whenCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we havedetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spendhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.",873
1963,"Many of my acquaintance arealready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearestfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that Idespair.",873
1964,"I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound inthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beauxwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three ofwhom we shall deprive you.’",873
1965,"“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more thiswinter.”",874
1966,“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”,875
1967,“Why will you think so?,876
1968,It must be his own doing; he is his own master.,876
1969,But you do not know _all_.,876
1970,I _will_ read you the passage whichparticularly hurts me.,876
1971,I will have no reserves from _you_.,876
1972,‘Mr.,876
1973,"Darcy isimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcelyless eager to meet her again.",876
1974,"I really do not think Georgiana Darcy hasher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affectionshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something stillmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her beinghereafter our sister.",876
1975,"I do not know whether I ever before mentioned toyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the countrywithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem themunreasonable.",876
1976,"My brother admires her greatly already; he will havefrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; herrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’spartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles mostcapable of engaging any woman’s heart.",876
1977,"With all these circumstances tofavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearestJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happinessof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” saidJane, as she finished it.",876
1978,“Is it not clear enough?,876
1979,Does it not expresslydeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and thatif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (mostkindly!),876
1980,to put me on my guard.,876
1981,Can there be any other opinion on thesubject?”,876
1982,"“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.",877
1983,Will you hear it?”,877
1984,“Most willingly.”,878
1985,“You shall have it in a few words.,879
1986,Miss Bingley sees that her brother isin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.,879
1987,"She follows him totown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that hedoes not care about you.”",879
1988,Jane shook her head.,880
1989,"“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.",881
1990,"No one who has ever seen youtogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: sheis not such a simpleton.",881
1991,"Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.",881
1992,"But thecase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and sheis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notionthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less troublein achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and Idare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.",881
1993,"But, mydearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingleytells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallestdegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you onTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, insteadof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”",881
1994,"“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “yourrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.",882
1995,But I know thefoundation is unjust.,882
1996,"Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceivinganyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceivedherself.”",882
1997,“That is right.,883
1998,"You could not have started a more happy idea, since youwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.",883
1999,"You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”",883
2000,"“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, inaccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marryelsewhere?”",884
2001,"“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon maturedeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters ismore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,by all means, to refuse him.”",885
2002,"“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I couldnot hesitate.”",886
2003,"“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consideryour situation with much compassion.”",887
2004,"“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never berequired.",888
2005,A thousand things may arise in six months.”,888
2006,The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmostcontempt.,889
2007,"It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’sinterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that thosewishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young manso totally independent of everyone.",889
2008,"She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt onthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",890
2009,"Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, thatBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.",890
2010,"They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of thefamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happento go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.",891
2011,"Afterlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation ofthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining atLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would takecare to have two full courses.",891
2013,CHAPTER XXII.,895
2015,"The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during thechief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.",897
2016,Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.,897
2017,"“It keeps him in goodhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”",897
2018,"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, andthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.",898
2019,"This wasvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabethhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure herfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towardsherself.",898
2020,"Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were sofavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almostsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.",898
2021,"But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the nextmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throwhimself at her feet.",898
2022,"He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail toconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almostsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.",898
2023,"Hisreception, however, was of the most flattering kind.",898
2024,"Miss Lucasperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, andinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.",898
2025,But little hadshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.,898
2026,"In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and asthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day thatwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation mustbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle withhis happiness.",899
2027,"The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature mustguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for itscontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure anddisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon thatestablishment were gained.",899
2028,Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.,900
2029,"Mr. Collins’s presentcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whomthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth wereexceedingly fair.",900
2030,"Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with moreinterest than the matter had ever",900
2032,     “So much love and eloquence”,902
2034,"excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; andSir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collinsshould be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highlyexpedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.James’s.",904
2035,The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on theoccasion.,904
2036,The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or twosooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relievedfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.,904
2037,Charlotteherself was tolerably composed.,904
2038,"She had gained her point, and had timeto consider of it.",904
2039,Her reflections were in general satisfactory.,904
2040,"Mr.Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society wasirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.",904
2041,But still he wouldbe her husband.,904
2042,"Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourableprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, howeveruncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservativefrom want.",904
2043,"This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age oftwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the goodluck of it.",904
2044,"The least agreeable circumstance in the business was thesurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship shevalued beyond that of any other person.",904
2045,"Elizabeth would wonder, andprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to beshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.",904
2046,"She resolvedto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family.",904
2047,"A promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he wasat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing topublish his prosperous love.",904
2048,"As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any ofthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladiesmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness andcordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.",905
2049,"“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularlygratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and youmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon aspossible.”",906
2050,"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish forso speedy a return, immediately said,--",907
2051,"“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, mygood sir?",908
2052,You had better neglect your relations than run the risk ofoffending your patroness.”,908
2053,"“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to youfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking somaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”",909
2054,“You cannot be too much on your guard.,910
2055,"Risk anything rather than herdispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to usagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”",910
2056,"“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by suchaffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receivefrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark ofyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.",911
2057,"As for my fair cousins,though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shallnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not exceptingmy cousin Elizabeth.”",911
2058,"With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equallysurprised to find that he meditated a quick return.",912
2059,"Mrs. Bennet wishedto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one ofher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",912
2060,"She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was asolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by nomeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read andimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a veryagreeable companion.",912
2061,But on the following morning every hope of thiskind was done away.,912
2062,"Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in aprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.",912
2063,"The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with herfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: butthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibilityas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment wasconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, andshe could not help crying out,--",913
2064,“Engaged to Mr. Collins!,914
2065,"my dear Charlotte, impossible!”",914
2066,"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling herstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct areproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regainedher composure, and calmly replied,--",915
2067,"“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?",916
2068,"Do you think it incrediblethat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”",916
2069,"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effortfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that theprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that shewished her all imaginable happiness.",917
2070,"“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.",918
2071,"But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will besatisfied with what I have done.",918
2072,"I am not romantic, you know.",918
2073,I neverwas.,918
2074,"I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’scharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that mychance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast onentering the marriage state.”",918
2075,"Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,they returned to the rest of the family.",919
2076,Charlotte did not stay muchlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.,919
2077,Itwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of sounsuitable a match.,919
2078,The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offersof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being nowaccepted.,919
2079,"She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony wasnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possiblethat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every betterfeeling to worldly advantage.",919
2080,"Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was amost humiliating picture!",919
2081,"And to the pang of a friend disgracingherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing convictionthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lotshe had chosen.",919
2083,     “Protested he must be entirely mistaken.”,922
2085,CHAPTER XXIII.,925
2087,"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on whatshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter toannounce her engagement to the family.",927
2088,"With many compliments to them,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between thehouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance thanpoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, alwaysunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--",927
2089,“Good Lord!,928
2090,"Sir William, how can you tell such a story?",928
2091,Do not you knowthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”,928
2092,"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have bornewithout anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carriedhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to thetruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with themost forbearing courtesy.",929
2093,"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasanta situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, bymentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; andendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which shewas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on thehappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent characterof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",930
2094,"Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal whileSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelingsfound a rapid vent.",931
2095,"In the first place, she persisted in disbelievingthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collinshad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happytogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off.",931
2096,"Twoinferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, thatElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, thatshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these twopoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.",931
2097,Nothing couldconsole and nothing appease her.,931
2098,Nor did that day wear out herresentment.,931
2099,A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth withoutscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir Williamor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before shecould at all forgive their daughter.,931
2100,"Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and suchas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; forit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he hadbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, andmore foolish than his daughter!",932
2101,Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she saidless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.,933
2102,"Kitty andLydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only aclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at Meryton.",933
2103,"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort onMrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and shecalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have beenenough to drive happiness away.",934
2104,Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept themmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that noreal confidence could ever subsist between them again.,935
2105,"Herdisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to hersister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion couldnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, asBingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.",935
2106,"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was countingthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.",936
2107,"The promisedletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to theirfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which atwelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted.",936
2108,"Afterdischarging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained theaffection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explainedthat it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he hadbeen so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again atLongbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, thatshe wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted wouldbe an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an earlyday for making him the happiest of men.",936
2109,Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter ofpleasure to Mrs. Bennet.,937
2110,"On the contrary, she was as much disposed tocomplain of it as her husband.",937
2111,It was very strange that he should cometo Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenientand exceedingly troublesome.,937
2112,"She hated having visitors in the housewhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people themost disagreeable.",937
2113,"Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and theygave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continuedabsence.",937
2114,Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.,938
2115,"Day afterday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than thereport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more toNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalousfalsehood.",938
2116,Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but thathis sisters would be successful in keeping him away.,939
2117,"Unwilling as shewas to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and sodishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent itsfrequently recurring.",939
2118,"The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of MissDarcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, forthe strength of his attachment.",939
2119,"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, morepainful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous ofconcealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subjectwas never alluded to.",940
2120,"But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, anhour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express herimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if hedid not come back she should think herself very ill-used.",940
2121,It needed allJane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerabletranquillity.,940
2122,"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but hisreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on hisfirst introduction.",941
2123,"He was too happy, however, to need much attention;and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved themfrom a great deal of his company.",941
2124,"The chief of every day was spent byhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in timeto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.",941
2126,     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”],943
2127,Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.,944
2128,"The very mention ofanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, andwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.",944
2129,The sight ofMiss Lucas was odious to her.,944
2130,"As her successor in that house, sheregarded her with jealous abhorrence.",944
2131,"Whenever Charlotte came to seethem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; andwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced thatthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herselfand her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead.",944
2132,Shecomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.,944
2133,"“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that CharlotteLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forcedto make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”",945
2134,"“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.",946
2135,Let us hope forbetter things.,946
2136,Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”,946
2137,"This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead ofmaking any answer, she went on as before.",947
2138,“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.,948
2139,"If it wasnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”",948
2140,“What should not you mind?”,949
2141,“I should not mind anything at all.”,950
2142,“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of suchinsensibility.”,951
2143,"“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.",952
2144,"Howanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s owndaughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!",952
2145,Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”,952
2146,"“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.",953
2148,CHAPTER XXIV.,957
2150,"Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.",959
2151,"The very firstsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London forthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having hadtime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he leftthe country.",959
2152,"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest ofthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of thewriter, that could give her any comfort.",960
2153,Miss Darcy’s praise occupiedthe chief of it.,960
2154,"Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Carolineboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predictthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her formerletter.",960
2155,"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being aninmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans ofthe latter with regard to new furniture.",960
2156,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,heard it in silent indignation.",961
2157,Her heart was divided between concernfor her sister and resentment against all others.,961
2158,"To Caroline’sassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid nocredit.",961
2159,"That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than shehad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, shecould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easinessof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slaveof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness tothe caprice of their inclinations.",961
2160,"Had his own happiness, however, beenthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it inwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, asshe thought he must be sensible himself.",961
2161,"It was a subject, in short, onwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.",961
2162,"Shecould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard hadreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it hadescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion ofhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’ssituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",961
2163,"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings toElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after alonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she couldnot help saying,--",962
2164,“O that my dear mother had more command over herself!,963
2165,she can have noidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.,963
2166,But Iwill not repine.,963
2167,It cannot last long.,963
2168,"He will be forgot, and we shallall be as we were before.”",963
2169,"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but saidnothing.",964
2170,"“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have noreason.",965
2171,He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of myacquaintance but that is all.,965
2172,"I have nothing either to hope or fear, andnothing to reproach him with.",965
2173,Thank God I have not _that_ pain.,965
2174,"A littletime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”",965
2175,"With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that ithas done no harm to anyone but myself.”",966
2176,"“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good.",967
2177,Your sweetnessand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say toyou.,967
2178,"I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as youdeserve.”",967
2179,"Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw backthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.",968
2180,"“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair.",969
2181,"_You_ wish to think all theworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.",969
2182,"_I_ only wantto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.",969
2183,"Do not beafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on yourprivilege of universal good-will.",969
2184,You need not.,969
2185,"There are few peoplewhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.",969
2186,"The more I seeof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirmsmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of thelittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either meritor sense.",969
2187,"I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,the other is Charlotte’s marriage.",969
2188,It is unaccountable!,969

2195,"“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one elsecould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded thatCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of herunderstanding than I now do of her heart.",971
2196,"My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is aconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well asI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries himcannot have a proper way of thinking.",971
2197,"You shall not defend her, thoughit is Charlotte Lucas.",971
2198,"You shall not, for the sake of one individual,change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuadeyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility ofdanger security for happiness.”",971
2199,"“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” repliedJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happytogether.",972
2200,But enough of this.,972
2201,You alluded to something else.,972
2202,Youmentioned _two_ instances.,972

2231,"Let me take itin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”",982
2232,Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’sname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.,983
2233,"Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning nomore; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not accountfor it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering itwith less perplexity.",984
2234,"Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of whatshe did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merelythe effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he sawher no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted atthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day.",984
2235,"Mrs. Bennet’s bestcomfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.",984
2236,Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.,985

2250,Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloomwhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbournfamily.,988
2251,"They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was nowadded that of general unreserve.",988
2252,"The whole of what Elizabeth had alreadyheard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody waspleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before theyhad known anything of the matter.",988
2253,"Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be anyextenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society ofHertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded forallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody elseMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.",989

2276,"He made her an offer in this very room,and she refused him.",998
2277,"The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will havea daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just asmuch entailed as ever.",998

2279,They are all for what they can get.,998
2280,"I am sorry to say it ofthem, but so it is.",998
2281,"It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwartedso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselvesbefore anybody else.",998

2283,"Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, inthe course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made hersister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned theconversation.",999

2295,"“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, sodoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.",1005
2296,"It is asoften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’sacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.",1005
2297,"Pray, how _violent was_Mr. Bingley’s love?”",1005
2298,"“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quiteinattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.",1006

2315,"Mr. Darcy may,perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but hewould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from itsimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingleynever stirs without him.”",1010

2418,"When she     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.",1049
2419,"I pity, though I     cannot help blaming, her.",1049
2420,"She was very wrong in singling me out as     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on     her side.",1049
2421,"But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her     brother is the cause of it.",1049
2422,"I need not explain myself farther; and     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable.",1049
2423,"I cannot but wonder,     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.",1049
2424,"He knows of my     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.",1049
2425,I cannot     understand it.,1049

2428,Let me hear     from you very soon.,1049
2429,"Miss Bingley said something of his never     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not     with any certainty.",1049
2430,We had better not mention it.,1049

2436,All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.,1051
2437,She would noteven wish for any renewal of his attentions.,1051
2438,"His character sunk on everyreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possibleadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantlyregret what he had thrown away.",1051
2439,"Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promiseconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth hadsuch to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than toherself.",1052
2440,"His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,he was the admirer of some one else.",1052
2441,"Elizabeth was watchful enough tosee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.",1052

2443,"The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the mostremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himselfagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case thanin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.",1052
2444,"Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able tosuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she wasready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could verysincerely wish him happy.",1052

2458,March was to takeElizabeth to Hunsford.,1060
2459,"She had not at first thought very seriously ofgoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on theplan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greaterpleasure as well as greater certainty.",1060
2460,"Absence had increased her desireof seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.",1060
2461,"There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and suchuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little changewas not unwelcome for its own sake.",1060
2462,"The journey would, moreover, giveher a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would havebeen very sorry for any delay.",1060

2467,The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; onhis side even more.,1062
2468,"His present pursuit could not make him forget thatElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, thefirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his mannerof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of whatshe was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting theiropinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, therewas a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her tohim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiableand pleasing.",1062
2469,Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her thinkhim less agreeable.,1063

2471,"Elizabeth loved absurdities, butshe had known Sir William’s too long.",1063
2472,"He could tell her nothing new ofthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities wereworn out, like his information.",1063
2473,"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so earlyas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon.",1064
2474,"As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’sdoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: whenthey entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful andlovely as ever.",1064
2475,"On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them towait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen herfor a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.",1064

2479,"Their first subject was hersister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply toher minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support herspirits, there were periods of dejection.",1065
2480,"It was reasonable, however, tohope that they would not continue long.",1065
2481,"Mrs. Gardiner gave her theparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, andrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane andherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up theacquaintance.",1065

2526,"Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting toElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she hadseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.",1089
2527,"When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was insearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.",1090
2528,The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side.,1090
2529,Elizabethsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.,1090
2530,At length the Parsonage was discernible.,1091
2531,"The garden sloping to theroad, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,everything declared they were arriving.",1091
2532,"Mr. Collins and Charlotteappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, whichled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles ofthe whole party.",1091
2533,"In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicingat the sight of each other.",1091
2534,"Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with theliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied withcoming, when she found herself so affectionately received.",1091
2535,She sawinstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her someminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all herfamily.,1091
2536,"They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out theneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they werein the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatiousformality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’soffers of refreshment.",1091
2537,"Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not helpfancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as ifwishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.",1092
2538,"But thougheverything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify himby any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.",1092
2539,"When Mr.Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye onCharlotte.",1092
2540,Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in generalCharlotte wisely did not hear.,1092
2541,"After sitting long enough to admireevery article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to thefender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that hadhappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in thegarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation ofwhich he attended himself.",1092
2542,"To work in his garden was one of his mostrespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenancewith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, andowned she encouraged it as much as possible.",1092
2543,"Here, leading the waythrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them aninterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed outwith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.",1092
2544,"He could number thefields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were inthe most distant clump.",1092
2545,"But of all the views which his garden, or whichthe country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared withthe prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees thatbordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.",1092
2546,"It was ahandsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",1092
2547,"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a whitefrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlottetook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’shelp.",1093
2548,"It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everythingwas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of whichElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.",1093
2549,"When Mr. Collins could beforgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and byCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be oftenforgotten.",1093
2550,She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.,1094
2551,"Itwas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joiningin, observed,--",1094
2552,"“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherinede Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you willbe delighted with her.",1095
2553,"She is all affability and condescension, and Idoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice whenservice is over.",1095
2554,I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she willinclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which shehonours us during your stay here.,1095

2560,"“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.",1097
2561,She is the sort ofwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”,1097
2562,"The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, andtelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate uponCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that itwas all done very well.",1098
2563,"She had also to anticipate how her visit wouldpass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatiousinterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercoursewith Rosings.",1098
2564,A lively imagination soon settled it all.,1098
2565,"About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting readyfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house inconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody runningupstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.",1099
2566,"She openedthe door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless withagitation, cried out,--",1099

2574,"Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in questof this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at thegarden gate.",1104
2575,“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth.,1105
2576,"“I expected at least that the pigswere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and herdaughter!”",1105
2577,“La!,1106
2578,"my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not LadyCatherine.",1106
2579,"The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.",1106

2590,"Yes, she will do for him very well.",1109
2591,She willmake him a very proper wife.”,1109

2593,"At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, andthe others returned into the house.",1111
2594,"Mr. Collins no sooner saw the twogirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, whichCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was askedto dine at Rosings the next day.",1111

2598,CHAPTER XXIX.,1117
2600,"Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.",1119
2601,"The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity ofdoing it should be given so soon was such an instance of LadyCatherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.",1119
2602,"“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised byher Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the eveningat Rosings.",1120
2603,"I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, thatit would happen.",1120
2604,But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?,1120
2605,"Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dinethere (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) soimmediately after your arrival?”",1120
2606,"“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, whichmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire.",1121

2608,Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but theirvisit to Rosings.,1122

2610,"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said toElizabeth,--",1123
2611,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.",1124
2612,LadyCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us whichbecomes herself and daughter.,1124
2613,I would advise you merely to put onwhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasionfor anything more.,1124
2614,Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you forbeing simply dressed.,1124
2615,She likes to have the distinction of rankpreserved.”,1124
2616,"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their differentdoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very muchobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner.",1125
2617,"Such formidable accounts ofher Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to herintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had doneto his presentation at St. James’s.",1125
2618,"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mileacross the park.",1126
2619,"Every park has its beauty and its prospects; andElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in suchraptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was butslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of thehouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originallycost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.",1126
2620,"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every momentincreasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.",1127
2621,Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her.,1127
2622,"She had heard nothing of LadyCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents ormiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank shethought she could witness without trepidation.",1127
2623,"From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with arapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followedthe servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting.",1128
2624,"Her Ladyship, with greatcondescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled itwith her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it wasperformed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thankswhich he would have thought necessary.",1128
2625,"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completelyawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courageenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edgeof her chair, not knowing which way to look.",1129
2626,"Elizabeth found herselfquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before hercomposedly.",1129
2627,"Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-markedfeatures, which might once have been handsome.",1129
2628,"Her air was notconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make hervisitors forget their inferior rank.",1129
2629,"She was not rendered formidable bysilence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone asmarked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately toElizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, shebelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.",1129
2630,"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportmentshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on thedaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at herbeing so thin and so small.",1130
2631,There was neither in figure nor face anylikeness between the ladies.,1130
2632,"Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: herfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke verylittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearancethere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listeningto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction beforeher eyes.",1130
2633,"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows toadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worthlooking at in the summer.",1131
2634,"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as hehad likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, byher Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnishnothing greater.",1132
2635,"He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, whowas now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in amanner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.",1132
2636,"But LadyCatherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave mostgracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a noveltyto them.",1132
2637,The party did not supply much conversation.,1132
2638,"Elizabeth was readyto speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated betweenCharlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged inlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her allthe dinnertime.",1132
2639,"Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching howlittle Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish andfearing she was indisposed.",1132
2640,"Maria thought speaking out of the question,and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.",1132
2641,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to bedone but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without anyintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on everysubject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to haveher judgment controverted.",1133
2642,"She inquired into Charlotte’s domesticconcerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice asto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to beregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to thecare of her cows and her poultry.",1133
2643,Elizabeth found that nothing wasbeneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with anoccasion for dictating to others.,1133
2644,"In the intervals of her discourse withMrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria andElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knewthe least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,pretty kind of girl.",1133
2645,"She asked her at different times how many sistersshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any ofthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where theyhad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been hermother’s maiden name?",1133
2646,"Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of herquestions, but answered them very composedly.",1133
2647,"Lady Catherine thenobserved,--",1133
2648,"“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think?",1134
2649,"For yoursake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see nooccasion for entailing estates from the female line.",1134
2650,It was not thoughtnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family.,1134

2677,who attended to you?,1148

2686,"Four niecesof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; andit was but the other day that I recommended another young person, whowas merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quitedelighted with her.",1150
2687,"Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’scalling yesterday to thank me?",1150
2688,She finds Miss Pope a treasure.,1150
2689,"‘LadyCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of youryounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”",1150
2690,"“Yes, ma’am, all.”",1151
2691,“All!,1152

2703,"“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedlyfor so young a person.",1154
2704,"Pray, what is your age?”",1154
2705,"“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “yourLadyship can hardly expect me to own it.”",1155
2706,Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had everdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.,1156
2707,"“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need notconceal your age.”",1157

2711,Their table was superlatively stupid.,1159
2712,"Scarcely a syllable wasuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinsonexpressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, orhaving too much or too little light.",1159
2713,A great deal more passed at theother table.,1159
2714,"Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakesof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.",1159
2715,"Mr. Collinswas employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking herfor every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.",1159
2716,Sir William did not say much.,1159
2717,He was storing his memory with anecdotesand noble names.,1159
2718,"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.",1160
2719,The party then gatheredround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they wereto have on the morrow.,1160

2721,"Assoon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by hercousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was.",1160
2722,"Buther commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no meanssatisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’spraise into his own hands.",1160
2724,CHAPTER XXX.,1164
2726,"Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was longenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were notoften met with.",1166
2727,"While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted hismornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: butwhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of hercousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfastand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or inreading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,which fronted the road.",1166
2728,The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.,1166
2729,"Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not preferthe dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had apleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellentreason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have beenmuch less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; andshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.",1166
2730,"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, andwere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages wentalong, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happenedalmost every day.",1167
2731,"She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and hada few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely everprevailed on to get out.",1167
2732,"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, andnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livingsto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so manyhours.",1168
2733,"Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room duringthese visits.",1168
2734,"She examined into their employments, looked at their work,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangementof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if sheaccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of findingout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.",1168
2735,"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in thecommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistratein her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her byMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to bequarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into thevillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scoldthem into harmony and plenty.",1169
2737,     “he never failed to inform them”],1171
2738,"The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only onecard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpartof the first.",1172
2739,"Their other engagements were few, as the style of livingof the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach.",1172
2740,"This,however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her timecomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation withCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that shehad often great enjoyment out of doors.",1172
2741,"Her favourite walk, and whereshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, wasalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there wasa nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, andwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.",1172
2742,In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.,1173
2743,"Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring anaddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must beimportant.",1173
2744,"Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcywas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there werenot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming wouldfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, andshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on himwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destinedby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatestsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, andseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen byMiss Lucas and herself.",1173
2745,"His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walkingthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,in order to have",1174
2747,“The gentlemen accompanied him.”,1176
2749,"the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriageturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence.",1178
2750,On thefollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.,1178
2751,"There weretwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had broughtwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,the gentlemen accompanied him.",1178
2752,"Charlotte had seen them from herhusband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into theother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--",1178
2753,"“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.",1179
2754,Mr. Darcy wouldnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”,1179
2755,"Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the complimentbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortlyafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.",1180
2756,"Colonel Fitzwilliam,who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person andaddress most truly the gentleman.",1180
2757,"Mr. Darcy looked just as he had beenused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usualreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards herfriend, met her with every appearance of composure.",1180
2758,"Elizabeth merelycourtesied to him, without saying a word.",1180
2759,"Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with thereadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; buthis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house andgarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.",1181
2760,"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire ofElizabeth after the health of her family.",1181
2761,"She answered him in the usualway; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--",1181
2762,“My eldest sister has been in town these three months.,1182
2763,Have you neverhappened to see her there?”,1182
2764,She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to seewhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between theBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as heanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.,1183
2765,"Thesubject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards wentaway.",1183
2767,“At Church”],1186
2768,CHAPTER XXXI.,1188
2770,"Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure oftheir engagements at Rosings.",1190
2771,"It was some days, however, before theyreceived any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in thehouse they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured bysuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church tocome there in the evening.",1190
2772,For the last week they had seen very littleof either Lady Catherine or her daughter.,1190
2773,"Colonel Fitzwilliam had calledat the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they hadonly seen at church.",1190
2774,"The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joinedthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room.",1191
2775,"Her Ladyship received themcivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means soacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,much more than to any other person in the room.",1191
2776,"Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was awelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,moreover, caught his fancy very much.",1192
2777,"He now seated himself by her, andtalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and stayingat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half sowell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so muchspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, aswell as of Mr. Darcy.",1192
2778,"_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turnedtowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after awhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did notscruple to call out,--",1192
2779,"“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?",1193
2780,What is it you are talkingof?,1193
2781,What are you telling Miss Bennet?,1193
2782,Let me hear what it is.”,1193
2783,"“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoida reply.",1194
2784,“Of music!,1195
2785,Then pray speak aloud.,1195
2786,It is of all subjects my delight.,1195
2787,"Imust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.",1195
2788,"There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more trueenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.",1195
2789,"If I had everlearnt, I should have been a great proficient.",1195
2790,"And so would Anne, if herhealth had allowed her to apply.",1195
2791,I am confident that she would haveperformed delightfully.,1195
2792,"How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”",1195
2793,Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.,1196
2794,"“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said LadyCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,if she does not practise a great deal.”",1197
2795,"“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.",1198
2796,She practises very constantly.”,1198
2797,“So much the better.,1199
2798,"It cannot be done too much; and when I next writeto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.",1199
2799,"I oftentell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired withoutconstant practice.",1199
2800,"I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she willnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often toldher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.Jenkinson’s room.",1199
2801,"She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that partof the house.”",1199
2802,"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and madeno answer.",1200
2803,"When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of havingpromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.",1201
2804,Hedrew a chair near her.,1201
2805,"Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and thentalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away fromher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’scountenance.",1201
2806,"Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the firstconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--",1201
2807,"“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hearme.",1202
2808,"But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.",1202
2809,There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened atthe will of others.,1202
2810,My courage always rises with every attempt tointimidate me.”,1202
2811,"“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you couldnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and Ihave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that youfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,are not your own.”",1203
2812,"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said toColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion ofme, and teach you not to believe a word I say.",1204
2813,"I am particularly unluckyin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in apart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degreeof credit.",1204
2814,"Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mentionall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give meleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”",1204
2815,"“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",1205
2816,"“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried ColonelFitzwilliam.",1206
2817,“I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”,1206
2818,"“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful.",1207
2819,"Thefirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was ata ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?",1207
2820,He danced only fourdances!,1207
2821,"I am sorry to pain you, but so it was.",1207
2822,"He danced only fourdances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, morethan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.",1207
2823,"Mr. Darcy,you cannot deny the fact.”",1207
2824,“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assemblybeyond my own party.”,1208
2825,“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room.,1209
2826,"Well, ColonelFitzwilliam, what do I play next?",1209
2827,My fingers wait your orders.”,1209
2828,"“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought anintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”",1210
2829,"“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, stilladdressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.",1211
2830,"“Shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommendhimself to strangers?”",1211
2831,"“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying tohim.",1212
2832,It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”,1212
2833,"“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.",1213
2834,"I cannotcatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in theirconcerns, as I often see done.”",1213
2835,"“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in themasterly manner which I see so many women’s do.",1214
2836,"They have not the sameforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.",1214
2837,But then Ihave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not takethe trouble of practising.,1214
2838,It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingersas capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”,1214
2839,"Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right.",1215
2840,You have employed yourtime much better.,1215
2841,No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting.,1215
2842,We neither of us perform to strangers.”,1215
2843,"Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to knowwhat they were talking of.",1216
2844,Elizabeth immediately began playing again.,1216
2845,"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, saidto Darcy,--",1216
2846,"“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, andcould have the advantage of a London master.",1217
2847,"She has a very good notionof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s.",1217
2848,"Anne would havebeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”",1217
2849,"Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to hiscousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to MissDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might havebeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.",1218
2850,"Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste.",1219
2851,Elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of thegentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage wasready to take them all home.,1219
2853,CHAPTER XXXII.,1223
2855,"Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of avisitor.",1225
2856,"As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to beLady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away herhalf-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.Darcy only, entered the room.",1225
2857,"He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for hisintrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies tobe within.",1226
2858,"They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.",1227
2859,"It was absolutelynecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergencyrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feelingcurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture, she observed,--",1227
2860,"“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!",1228
2861,"It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see youall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the daybefore.",1228
2862,"He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”",1228
2863,"“Perfectly so, I thank you.”",1229
2864,"She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a shortpause, added,--",1230
2865,“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of everreturning to Netherfield again?”,1231
2866,“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in future.,1232
2867,"He has many friends, and he isat a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasing.”",1232
2868,"“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for theneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then wemight possibly get a settled family there.",1233
2869,"But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the sameprinciple.”",1233
2870,"“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers.”",1234
2871,Elizabeth made no answer.,1235
2872,"She was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him.",1235
2873,"He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortablehouse.",1236
2874,"Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.Collins first came to Hunsford.”",1236
2875,“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object.”,1237
2876,“Mr.,1238
2877,Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”,1238
2878,"“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one ofthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have madehim happy if they had.",1239
2879,My friend has an excellent understanding--thoughI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisestthing she ever did.,1239
2880,"She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in aprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”",1239
2881,“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own family and friends.”,1240
2882,“An easy distance do you call it?,1241
2883,It is nearly fifty miles.”,1241
2884,“And what is fifty miles of good road?,1242
2885,Little more than half a day’sjourney.,1242
2886,"Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”",1242
2887,"“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_of the match,” cried Elizabeth.",1243
2888,“I should never have said Mrs. Collinswas settled _near_ her family.”,1243
2889,“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.,1244
2890,"Anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”",1244
2891,"As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied sheunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane andNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--",1245
2892,“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily.,1246
2893,"The far and the near must be relative, and depend on manyvarying circumstances.",1246
2894,"Where there is fortune to make the expense oftravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.",1246
2895,But that is not thecase _here_.,1246
2896,"Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded myfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_the present distance.”",1246
2897,"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment.",1247
2898,_You_ cannot havebeen always at Longbourn.”,1247
2899,Elizabeth looked surprised.,1248
2900,"The gentleman experienced some change offeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--",1248
2901,“Are you pleased with Kent?”,1249
2902,"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either sidecalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotteand her sister, just returned from their walk.",1250
2903,The _tête-à-tête_surprised them.,1250
2904,"Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned hisintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,without saying much to anybody, went away.",1250
2907,"“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he wasgone.",1253
2908,"“My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would neverhave called on us in this familiar way.”",1253
2909,"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after variousconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probablefrom the time of year.",1254
2910,All field sports were over.,1254
2911,"Within doors therewas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot bealways within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or thepleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day.",1254
2912,"They called at various times of the morning, sometimesseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by theiraunt.",1254
2913,"It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her formerfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw therewas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, shebelieved he might have the best informed mind.",1254
2914,But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficultto understand.,1255
2915,"It could not be for society, as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, itseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice topropriety, not a pleasure to himself.",1255
2916,He seldom appeared reallyanimated.,1255
2917,Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him.,1255
2918,"ColonelFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he wasgenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect oflove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herselfseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were atRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.",1255
2919,"Hecertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of thatlook was disputable.",1255
2920,"It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she oftendoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mind.",1255
2921,"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike wouldvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",1256
2922,"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marryingColonel Fitzwilliam.",1257
2923,"He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: hecertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronagein the church, and his cousin could have none at all.",1257
2925,CHAPTER XXXIII.,1261
2927,"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.",1263
2928,"She felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, toprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,that it was a favourite haunt of hers.",1263
2929,"How it could occur a second time,therefore, was very odd!",1263
2930,"Yet it did, and even the third.",1263
2931,"It seemed likewilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.",1263
2932,"Henever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their thirdencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about herpleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and heropinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking ofRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying_there_ too.",1263
2933,His words seemed to imply it.,1263
2934,Could he have ColonelFitzwilliam in his thoughts?,1263
2935,"She supposed, if he meant anything, he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.",1263
2936,"It distressed hera little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the Parsonage.",1263
2937,"She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s lastletter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had notwritten in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.",1264
2938,"Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--",1264
2939,“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”,1265
2940,"“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generallydo every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.",1266
2941,Are you going much farther?”,1266
2942,"“No, I should have turned in a moment.”",1267
2943,"And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonagetogether.",1268
2944,“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.,1269
2945,“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.,1270
2946,But I am at his disposal.,1270
2947,Hearranges the business just as he pleases.”,1270
2948,"“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at leastgreat pleasure in the power of choice.",1271
2949,I do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”,1271
2950,"“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.",1272
2951,“But so we all do.,1272
2952,"It is only that he has better means of having it thanmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.",1272
2953,I speakfeelingly.,1272
2954,"A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial anddependence.”",1272
2955,"“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little ofeither.",1273
2956,"Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial anddependence?",1273
2957,When have you been prevented by want of money from goingwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”,1273
2958,“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I haveexperienced many hardships of that nature.,1274
2959,"But in matters of greaterweight, I may suffer from the want of money.",1274
2960,Younger sons cannot marrywhere they like.”,1274
2961,"“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very oftendo.”",1275
2962,"“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many inmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoney.”",1276
2963,"“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at theidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what isthe usual price of an earl’s younger son?",1277
2964,"Unless the elder brother isvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”",1277
2965,"He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.",1278
2966,"To interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,she soon afterwards said,--",1278
2967,“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving somebody at his disposal.,1279
2968,"I wonder he does not marry, to secure alasting convenience of that kind.",1279
2969,"But, perhaps, his sister does as wellfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what helikes with her.”",1279
2970,"“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me.",1280
2971,I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”,1280
2972,"“Are you, indeed?",1281
2973,And pray what sort of a guardian do you make?,1281
2974,Doesyour charge give you much trouble?,1281
2975,"Young ladies of her age are sometimesa little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, shemay like to have her own way.”",1281
2976,"As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely togive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth.",1282
2977,"She directly replied,--",1282
2978,“You need not be frightened.,1283
2979,I never heard any harm of her; and I daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.,1283
2980,"She is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst andMiss Bingley.",1283
2981,I think I have heard you say that you know them.”,1283
2982,“I know them a little.,1284
2983,"Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlikeman--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”",1284
2984,"“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr.",1285
2985,"Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”",1285
2986,“Care of him!,1286
2987,"Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him inthose points where he most wants care.",1286
2988,"From something that he told mein our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebtedto him.",1286
2989,"But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to supposethat Bingley was the person meant.",1286
2990,It was all conjecture.”,1286
2991,“What is it you mean?”,1287
2992,"“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to begenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family itwould be an unpleasant thing.”",1288
2993,“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”,1289
2994,“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to beBingley.,1290
2995,"What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing himthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”",1290
2996,“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”,1291
2997,“I understood that there were some very strong objections against thelady.”,1292
2998,“And what arts did he use to separate them?”,1293
2999,"“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.",1294
3000,“Heonly told me what I have now told you.”,1294
3001,"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling withindignation.",1295
3002,"After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtful.",1295
3003,"“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she.",1296
3004,“Yourcousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings.,1296
3005,Why was he to be thejudge?”,1296
3006,“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”,1297
3007,"“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was todetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy.",1298
3008,"But,”she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of theparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him.",1298
3009,It is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the case.”,1298
3010,"“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it islessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”",1299
3011,"This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture ofMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferentmatters till they reached the Parsonage.",1300
3012,"There, shut into her own room,as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard.",1300
3013,It was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected.,1300
3014,Therecould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could havesuch boundless influence.,1300
3015,"That he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but shehad always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design andarrangement of them.",1300
3016,"If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all thatJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.",1300
3017,"He had ruined for awhile every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heartin the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might haveinflicted.",1300
3018,"“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were ColonelFitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was inbusiness in London.",1301
3019,"“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility ofobjection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is!",1302
3020,"Her understandingexcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.",1302
3021,"Neither couldanything be urged against my father, who, though with somepeculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thoughtof her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she wouldnot allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound fromthe want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their wantof sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partlygoverned by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish ofretaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.",1302
3022,"The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on aheadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added toher unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend hercousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.",1303
3023,"Mrs. Collins,seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collinscould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being ratherdispleased by her staying at home.",1303
3025,CHAPTER XXXIV.,1307
3027,"When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself asmuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since herbeing in Kent.",1309
3028,"They contained no actual complaint, nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.",1309
3029,"But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindlydisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.",1309
3030,"Elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.",1309
3031,Mr. Darcy’sshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her akeener sense of her sister’s sufferings.,1309
3032,"It was some consolation tothink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself bewith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of herspirits, by all that affection could do.",1309
3033,"She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that hiscousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did notmean to be unhappy about him.",1310
3034,"While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoor-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late inthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.",1311
3035,"Butthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differentlyaffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into theroom.",1311
3036,"In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.",1311
3037,She answered him with cold civility.,1311
3038,"He sat down for a few moments, andthen getting up walked about the room.",1311
3039,"Elizabeth was surprised, butsaid not a word.",1311
3040,"After a silence of several minutes, he came towards herin an agitated manner, and thus began:--",1311
3041,“In vain have I struggled.,1312
3042,It will not do.,1312
3043,My feelings will not berepressed.,1312
3044,You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and loveyou.”,1312
3045,Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression.,1313
3046,"She stared, coloured,doubted, and was silent.",1313
3047,"This he considered sufficient encouragement,and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediatelyfollowed.",1313
3048,"He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of theheart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject oftenderness than of pride.",1313
3049,"His sense of her inferiority, of its being adegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposedto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to theconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend hissuit.",1313
3050,"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions didnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lostall compassion in anger.",1314
3051,"She tried, however, to compose herself toanswer him with patience, when he should have done.",1314
3052,He concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite ofall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand.,1314
3053,As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of afavourable answer.,1314
3054,"He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but hiscountenance expressed real security.",1314
3055,"Such a circumstance could onlyexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeksand she said,--",1314
3056,"“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, howeverunequally they may be returned.",1315
3057,"It is natural that obligation should befelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.",1315
3058,"But Icannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly.",1315
3059,I am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone.,1315
3060,"It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will beof short duration.",1315
3061,The feelings which you tell me have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanation.”,1315
3062,"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixedon her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise.",1316
3063,"His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance ofhis mind was visible in every feature.",1316
3064,"He was struggling for theappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it.",1316
3065,The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelingsdreadful.,1316
3066,"At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--",1316
3067,“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!,1317
3068,"Imight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ atcivility, I am thus rejected.",1317
3069,But it is of small importance.”,1317
3070,"“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a designof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked meagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?",1318
3071,"Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?",1318
3072,But I haveother provocations.,1318
3073,You know I have.,1318
3074,"Had not my own feelings decidedagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even beenfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to acceptthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, thehappiness of a most beloved sister?”",1318
3075,"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotionwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while shecontinued,--",1319
3076,“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.,1320
3077,No motive canexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.,1320
3078,"You dare not,you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only meansof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of theworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutestkind.”",1320
3079,"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listeningwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.",1321
3080,He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.,1321
3081,“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.,1322
3082,"With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denyingthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister, or that I rejoice in my success.",1323
3083,Towards _him_ I have beenkinder than towards myself.”,1323
3084,"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.",1324
3085,"“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislikeis founded.",1325
3086,"Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you wasdecided.",1325
3087,Your character was unfolded in the recital which I receivedmany months ago from Mr. Wickham.,1325
3088,"On this subject, what can you have tosay?",1325
3089,In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?,1325
3090,or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”,1325
3091,"“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.",1326
3092,“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling aninterest in him?”,1327
3093,"“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, hismisfortunes have been great indeed.”",1328
3094,"“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You havereduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty.",1329
3095,Youhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designedfor him.,1329
3096,You have deprived the best years of his life of thatindependence which was no less his due than his desert.,1329
3097,You have doneall this!,1329
3098,and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes withcontempt and ridicule.”,1329
3099,"“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,“is your opinion of me!",1330
3100,This is the estimation in which you hold me!,1330
3101,Ithank you for explaining it so fully.,1330
3102,"My faults, according to thiscalculation, are heavy indeed!",1330
3103,"But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in hiswalk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have beenoverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.",1330
3104,"Thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greaterpolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of mybeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, byreflection, by everything.",1330
3105,But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.,1330
3106,Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.,1330
3107,They were natural and just.,1330
3108,Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of yourconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whosecondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”,1330
3109,"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried tothe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--",1331
3110,"“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of yourdeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me theconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in amore gentlemanlike manner.”",1332
3111,"She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--",1333
3112,“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible waythat would have tempted me to accept it.”,1334
3113,Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with anexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification.,1335
3114,"She went on,--",1335
3115,"“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of myacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullestbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of thefeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork ofdisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable adislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were thelast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”",1336
3116,"“You have said quite enough, madam.",1337
3117,"I perfectly comprehend yourfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.",1337
3118,"Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my bestwishes for your health and happiness.”",1337
3119,"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard himthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.",1338
3120,The tumult ofher mind was now painfully great.,1338
3121,"She knew not how to support herself,and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour.",1338
3122,"Herastonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased byevery review of it.",1338
3123,That she should receive an offer of marriage fromMr. Darcy!,1338
3124,that he should have been in love with her for so many months!,1338
3125,"so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objectionswhich had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and whichmust appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almostincredible!",1338
3126,it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strongan affection.,1338
3127,"But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowalof what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance inacknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling mannerwhich he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had notattempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of hisattachment had for a moment excited.",1338
3128,"She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of LadyCatherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounterCharlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.",1339
3130,“Hearing herself called”],1342
3131,CHAPTER XXXV.,1344
3133,Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditationswhich had at length closed her eyes.,1346
3134,"She could not yet recover from thesurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anythingelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon afterbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.",1346
3135,"She was proceedingdirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’ssometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road.",1346
3136,"Thepark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed oneof the gates into the ground.",1346
3137,"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she wastempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates andlook into the park.",1347
3138,"The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent hadmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to theverdure of the early trees.",1347
3139,"She was on the point of continuing herwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grovewhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its beingMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.",1347
3140,"But the person who advanced wasnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,pronounced her name.",1347
3141,"She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved againtowards the gate.",1347
3142,"He had by that time reached it also; and, holding outa letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughtycomposure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope ofmeeting you.",1347
3143,"Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” andthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soonout of sight.",1347
3144,"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, writtenquite through, in a very close hand.",1348
3145,The envelope itself was likewisefull.,1348
3146,"Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.",1348
3147,"It was datedfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",1348
3148,"“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension ofits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of thoseoffers, which were last night so disgusting to you.",1349
3149,"I write without anyintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and theeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,should have been spared, had not my character required it to be writtenand read.",1349
3150,"You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demandyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but Idemand it of your justice.",1349
3151,"“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equalmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge.",1350
3152,"The first mentioned was,that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingleyfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of variousclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediateprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.",1350
3153,"Wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledgedfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expectits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two youngpersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, couldbear no comparison.",1350
3154,"But from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hopeto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions andtheir motives has been read.",1350
3155,"If, in the explanation of them which is dueto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may beoffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.",1350
3156,"The necessity mustbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.",1350
3157,"I had not been long inHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingleypreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country.",1350
3158,Butit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had anyapprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.,1350
3159,I had often seen himin love before.,1350
3160,"At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing withyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidentalinformation, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise toa general expectation of their marriage.",1350
3161,"He spoke of it as a certainevent, of which the time alone could be undecided.",1350
3162,From that moment Iobserved my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceivethat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessedin him.,1350
3163,Your sister I also watched.,1350
3164,"Her look and manners were open,cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiarregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, thatthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invitethem by any participation of sentiment.",1350
3165,"If _you_ have not been mistakenhere, _I_ must have been in an error.",1350
3166,Your superior knowledge of yoursister must make the latter probable.,1350
3167,"If it be so, if I have been misledby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not beenunreasonable.",1350
3168,"But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity ofyour sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the mostacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heartwas not likely to be easily touched.",1350
3169,That I was desirous of believingher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that myinvestigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes orfears.,1350
3170,"I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; Ibelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.",1350
3171,My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last nightacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put asidein my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil tomy friend as to me.,1350
3172,"But there were other causes of repugnance; causeswhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in bothinstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were notimmediately before me.",1350
3173,"These causes must be stated, though briefly.",1350
3174,"Thesituation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing incomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almostuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, andoccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offendyou.",1350
3175,"But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give youconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoidany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed onyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense anddisposition of both.",1350
3176,"I will only say, farther, that from what passedthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and everyinducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve myfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.",1350
3177,"He leftNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,remember, with the design of soon returning.",1350
3178,The part which I acted isnow to be explained.,1350
3179,"His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excitedwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alikesensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, weshortly resolved on joining him directly in London.",1350
3180,We accordinglywent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to myfriend the certain evils of such a choice.,1350
3181,I described and enforced themearnestly.,1350
3182,"But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayedhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately haveprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, whichI hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference.",1350
3183,"He had beforebelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,regard.",1350
3184,"But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a strongerdependence on my judgment than on his own.",1350
3185,"To convince him, therefore,that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point.",1350
3186,"To persuadehim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had beengiven, was scarcely the work of a moment.",1350
3187,I cannot blame myself forhaving done thus much.,1350
3188,"There is but one part of my conduct, in the wholeaffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that Icondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from himyour sister’s being in town.",1350
3189,"I knew it myself, as it was known to MissBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.",1350
3190,"That they mighthave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regarddid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without somedanger.",1350
3191,"Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.",1350
3192,"It isdone, however, and it was done for the best.",1350
3193,"On this subject I havenothing more to say, no other apology to offer.",1350
3194,"If I have wounded yoursister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives whichgoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have notyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weightyaccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it bylaying before you the whole of his connection with my family.",1350
3195,Of what hehas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what Ishall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.,1350
3196,"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many yearsthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct inthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of serviceto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness wastherefore liberally bestowed.",1350
3197,"My father supported him at school, andafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable togive him a gentleman’s education.",1350
3198,"My father was not only fond of thisyoung man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also thehighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,intended to provide for him in it.",1350
3199,"As for myself, it is many, many yearssince I first began to think of him in a very different manner.",1350
3200,"Thevicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful toguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape theobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and whohad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcycould not have.",1350
3201,Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree youonly can tell.,1350
3202,"But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham hascreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfoldinghis real character.",1350
3203,It adds even another motive.,1350
3204,"My excellent fatherdied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to thelast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me topromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession mightallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family livingmight be his as soon as it became vacant.",1350
3205,There was also a legacy ofone thousand pounds.,1350
3206,"His own father did not long survive mine; andwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform methat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I shouldnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediatepecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not bebenefited.",1350
3207,"He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and Imust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a veryinsufficient support therein.",1350
3208,"I rather wished than believed him to besincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to hisproposal.",1350
3209,I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.,1350
3210,Thebusiness was therefore soon settled.,1350
3211,"He resigned all claim to assistancein the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.",1350
3212,All connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved.,1350
3213,"I thought too ill of him to invite himto Pemberley, or admit his society in town.",1350
3214,"In town, I believe, hechiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and beingnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness anddissipation.",1350
3215,"For about three years I heard little of him; but on thedecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.",1350
3216,"Hiscircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,were exceedingly bad.",1350
3217,"He had found the law a most unprofitable study,and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would presenthim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be littledoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.",1350
3218,"You willhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or forresisting every repetition of it.",1350
3219,His resentment was in proportion tothe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent inhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.,1350
3220,"After thisperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.",1350
3221,"How he lived, Iknow not.",1350
3222,But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on mynotice.,1350
3223,"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forgetmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce meto unfold to any human being.",1350
3224,"Having said thus much, I feel no doubt ofyour secrecy.",1350
3225,"My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was leftto the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, andmyself.",1350
3226,"About a year ago, she was taken from school, and anestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went withthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prioracquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we weremost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so farrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained astrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she waspersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement.",1350
3227,"Shewas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating herimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it toherself.",1350
3228,"I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intendedelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grievingand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,acknowledged the whole to me.",1350
3229,You may imagine what I felt and how Iacted.,1350
3230,"Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any publicexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge.",1350
3231,"Mr. Wickham’schief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirtythousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenginghimself on me was a strong inducement.",1350
3232,His revenge would have beencomplete indeed.,1350
3233,"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event inwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutelyreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of crueltytowards Mr. Wickham.",1350
3234,"I know not in what manner, under what form offalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to bewondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerningeither.",1350
3235,"Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainlynot in your inclination.",1350
3236,You may possibly wonder why all this was nottold you last night.,1350
3237,But I was not then master enough of myself to knowwhat could or ought to be revealed.,1350
3238,"For the truth of everything hererelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of ColonelFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, andstill more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has beenunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.",1350
3239,"Ifyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, youcannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; andthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavourto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in thecourse of the morning.",1350
3240,"I will only add, God bless you.",1350
3241,“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”,1351
3243,CHAPTER XXXVI.,1355
3245,"Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it tocontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents.",1357
3246,"But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerlyshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",1357
3247,Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.,1357
3248,"With amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation togive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.",1357
3249,"With a strongprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account ofwhat had happened at Netherfield.",1357
3250,"She read with an eagerness whichhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowingwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to thesense of the one before her eyes.",1357
3251,"His belief of her sister’sinsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of thereal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have anywish of doing him justice.",1357
3252,"He expressed no regret for what he had donewhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.",1357
3253,It was allpride and insolence.,1357
3254,"But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--whenshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelingswere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.",1358
3255,"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.",1358
3256,"She wishedto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!",1358
3257,This cannot be!,1358
3258,"This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she hadgone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would notregard it, that she would never look in it again.",1358
3259,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest onnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.",1359
3260,"The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactlywhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with hisown words.",1359
3261,"So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came tothe will, the difference was great.",1359
3262,"What Wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err.",1359
3263,"But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, theparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensionsto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.",1359
3264,"She put down theletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but withlittle success.",1359
3265,On both sides it was only assertion.,1359
3266,Again she read on.,1359
3267,"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.",1359
3268,"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay toMr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she couldbring no proof of its injustice.",1360
3269,"She had never heard of him before hisentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at thepersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,had there renewed a slight acquaintance.",1360
3270,"Of his former way of life,nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told",1360
3272,     “Meeting accidentally in Town”,1362
3274,himself.,1364
3275,"As to his real character, had information been in her power,she had never felt a wish of inquiring.",1364
3276,"His countenance, voice, andmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.",1364
3277,"She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguishedtrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from theattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atonefor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class whatMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’continuance.",1364
3278,But no such recollection befriended her.,1364
3279,"She could see himinstantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she couldremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of theneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him inthe mess.",1364
3280,"After pausing on this point a considerable while, she oncemore continued to read.",1364
3281,"But, alas!",1364
3282,"the story which followed, of hisdesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passedbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and atlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to ColonelFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received theinformation of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whosecharacter she had no reason to question.",1364
3283,"At one time she had almostresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardnessof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction thatMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not beenwell assured of his cousin’s corroboration.",1364
3284,She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.,1365
3285,Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.,1365
3286,"She was _now_struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, andwondered it had escaped her before.",1365
3287,"She saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct.",1365
3288,"She remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ballthe very next week.",1365
3289,"She remembered, also, that till the Netherfieldfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one butherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’scharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father wouldalways prevent his exposing the son.",1365
3290,How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!,1366
3291,"Hisattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely andhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longerthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.",1366
3292,"His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he hadeither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifyinghis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had mostincautiously shown.",1366
3293,"Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainterand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could notbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long agoasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive aswere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of theiracquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them muchtogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anythingthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke himof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he wasesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as abrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of hissister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had hisactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation ofeverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; andthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable manas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.",1366
3294,She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.,1367
3295,"Of neither Darcy nor Wickhamcould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,prejudiced, absurd.",1367
3296,“How despicably have I acted!” she cried.,1368
3297,"“I, who have prided myself onmy discernment!",1368
3298,"I, who have valued myself on my abilities!",1368
3299,"who haveoften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified myvanity in useless or blameless distrust.",1368
3300,How humiliating is thisdiscovery!,1368
3301,"Yet, how just a humiliation!",1368
3302,"Had I been in love, I could nothave been more wretchedly blind.",1368
3303,"But vanity, not love, has been myfolly.",1368
3304,"Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglectof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courtedprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either wereconcerned.",1368
3305,"Till this moment, I never knew myself.”",1368
3306,"From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a linewhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.",1369
3307,Widelydifferent was the effect of a second perusal.,1369
3308,"How could she deny thatcredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged togive in the other?",1369
3309,He declared himself to have been totally unsuspiciousof her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering whatCharlotte’s opinion had always been.,1369
3310,Neither could she deny the justiceof his description of Jane.,1369
3311,"She felt that Jane’s feelings, thoughfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constantcomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with greatsensibility.",1369
3312,"When she came to that part of the letter in which her family werementioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her senseof shame was severe.",1370

3314,The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt.,1371
3315,"It soothed, butit could not console her for the contempt which had been thusself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered thatJane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearestrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurtby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything shehad ever known before.",1371
3316,"After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to everyvariety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, andreconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and soimportant, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her atlength return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearingcheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections asmust make her unfit for conversation.",1372

3419,Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins youhave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appearthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will beas well to be silent.,1414

3426,Poor Charlotte!,1415
3427,it was melancholy to leave her to suchsociety!,1415

3447,"To knowthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonishJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her ownvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptationto openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecisionin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried intorepeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sisterfurther.",1427

3551,Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterlypartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectlynatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.,1466
3552,She wassorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner solittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for theunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.,1466
3553,"“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainlyought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase hisdisappointment.”",1467
3554,"“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he hasother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.",1468
3555,"You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”",1468
3556,“Blame you!,1469
3557,"Oh, no.”",1469
3558,“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”,1470
3559,“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”,1471
3560,"“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the verynext day.”",1472
3561,"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as faras they concerned George Wickham.",1473
3562,"What a stroke was this for poor Jane,who would willingly have gone through the world without believing thatso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was herecollected in one individual!",1473
3563,"Nor was Darcy’s vindication, thoughgrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.",1473
3564,"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, andseek to clear one, without involving the other.",1473
3565,"“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make bothof them good for anything.",1474
3566,"Take your choice, but you must be satisfiedwith only one.",1474
3567,There is but such a quantity of merit between them; justenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shiftingabout pretty much.,1474
3568,"For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”",1474
3569,"It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.",1475
3570,"“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she.",1476
3571,“Wickham sovery bad!,1476
3572,It is almost past belief.,1476
3573,And poor Mr. Darcy!,1476
3574,"dear Lizzy,only consider what he must have suffered.",1476
3575,Such a disappointment!,1476
3576,andwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too!,1476
3577,and having to relate such athing of his sister!,1476
3578,"It is really too distressing, I am sure you mustfeel it so.”",1476
3579,"“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so fullof both.",1477
3580,"I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growingevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent.",1477
3581,"Your profusion makes mesaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be aslight as a feather.”",1477
3582,“Poor Wickham!,1478
3583,there is such an expression of goodness in hiscountenance!,1478
3584,such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”,1478
3585,“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of thosetwo young men.,1479
3586,"One has got all the goodness, and the other all theappearance of it.”",1479
3587,“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as youused to do.”,1480
3588,"“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a disliketo him, without any reason.",1481
3589,"It is such a spur to one’s genius, such anopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.",1481
3590,One may be continuallyabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughingat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”,1481
3591,"“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treatthe matter as you do now.”",1482
3592,"“Indeed, I could not.",1483
3593,"I was uncomfortable enough, I was veryuncomfortable--I may say unhappy.",1483
3594,"And with no one to speak to of what Ifelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had!",1483
3595,"Oh, how I wanted you!”",1483
3596,"“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressionsin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear whollyundeserved.”",1484
3597,“Certainly.,1485
3598,But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a mostnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.,1485
3599,There isone point on which I want your advice.,1485
3600,"I want to be told whether Iought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understandWickham’s character.”",1485
3601,"Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be nooccasion for exposing him so dreadfully.",1486
3602,What is your own opinion?”,1486
3603,“That it ought not to be attempted.,1487
3604,Mr. Darcy has not authorized me tomake his communication public.,1487
3605,"On the contrary, every particularrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible tomyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hisconduct, who will believe me?",1487
3606,"The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy isso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people inMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.",1487
3607,I am not equal toit.,1487
3608,"Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify toanybody here what he really is.",1487
3609,"Some time hence it will be all foundout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.",1487
3610,At present I will say nothing about it.”,1487
3611,“You are quite right.,1488
3612,To have his errors made public might ruin him forever.,1488
3613,"He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious tore-establish a character.",1488
3614,We must not make him desperate.”,1488
3615,The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.,1489
3616,"Shehad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for afortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever shemight wish to talk again of either.",1489
3617,"But there was still somethinglurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure.",1489
3618,"She dared notrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sisterhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend.",1489
3619,Here was knowledge inwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less thana perfect understanding between the parties could justify her inthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery.,1489
3620,"“And then,” said she, “ifthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely beable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable mannerhimself.",1489
3621,The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lostall its value!”,1489
3622,"She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the realstate of her sister’s spirits.",1490
3623,Jane was not happy.,1490
3624,She still cherished avery tender affection for Bingley.,1490
3625,"Having never even fancied herself inlove before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and fromher age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments oftenboast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him toevery other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to thefeelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of thoseregrets which must have been injurious to her own health and theirtranquillity.",1490
3626,"“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ ofthis sad business of Jane’s?",1491
3627,"For my part, I am determined never to speakof it again to anybody.",1491
3628,I told my sister Philips so the other day.,1491
3629,But Icannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.,1491
3630,"Well, he is avery undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the leastchance in the world of her ever getting him now.",1491
3631,"There is no talk of hiscoming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired ofeverybody, too, who is likely to know.”",1491
3633,     “I am determined never to speak of it again”],1493
3634,“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”,1494
3635,"“Oh, well!",1495
3636,it is just as he chooses.,1495
3637,"Nobody wants him to come; though Ishall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I washer, I would not have put up with it.",1495
3638,"Well, my comfort is, I am sureJane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what hehas done.”",1495
3639,But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation shemade no answer.,1496
3640,"“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so theCollinses live very comfortable, do they?",1497
3641,"Well, well, I only hope itwill last.",1497
3642,And what sort of table do they keep?,1497
3643,"Charlotte is anexcellent manager, I dare say.",1497
3644,"If she is half as sharp as her mother,she is saving enough.",1497
3645,"There is nothing extravagant in _their_housekeeping, I dare say.”",1497
3646,"“No, nothing at all.”",1498
3647,"“A great deal of good management, depend upon it.",1499
3648,"Yes, yes.",1499
3649,_They_ willtake care not to outrun their income.,1499
3650,_They_ will never be distressedfor money.,1499
3651,"Well, much good may it do them!",1499
3652,"And so, I suppose, they oftentalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.",1499
3653,"They look upon itquite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”",1499
3654,“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”,1500
3655,“No; it would have been strange if they had.,1501
3656,But I make no doubt theyoften talk of it between themselves.,1501
3657,"Well, if they can be easy with anestate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.",1501
3658,_I_ should beashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”,1501
3660,“When Colonel Miller’s regiment went away”,1504
3662,CHAPTER XLI.,1507
3664,The first week of their return was soon gone.,1509
3665,The second began.,1509
3666,"It wasthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies inthe neighbourhood were drooping apace.",1509
3667,The dejection was almostuniversal.,1509
3668,"The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.",1509
3669,"Veryfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty andLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend suchhard-heartedness in any of the family.",1509
3670,“Good Heaven!,1510
3671,What is to become of us?,1510
3672,What are we to do?” would theyoften exclaim in the bitterness of woe.,1510
3673,"“How can you be smiling so,Lizzy?”",1510
3674,Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered whatshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.,1511
3675,"“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when ColonelMiller’s regiment went away.",1512
3676,I thought I should have broke my heart.”,1512
3677,"“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.",1513
3678,“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.,1514
3679,“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton!,1515
3680,But papa is so disagreeable.”,1515
3681,“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”,1516
3682,"“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”added Kitty.",1517
3683,Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually throughLongbourn House.,1518
3684,Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all senseof pleasure was lost in shame.,1518
3685,She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’sobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon hisinterference in the views of his friend.,1518
3686,"But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for shereceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of theregiment, to accompany her to Brighton.",1519
3687,"This invaluable friend was avery young woman, and very lately married.",1519
3688,"A resemblance in good-humourand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out oftheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.",1519
3689,"The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcelyto be described.",1520
3690,"Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flewabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’scongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fatein terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.",1520
3691,"“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend.",1521
3692,"I have just as muchright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”",1521
3693,"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to makeher resigned.",1522
3694,"As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far fromexciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that sheconsidered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sensefor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were itknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let hergo.",1522
3695,"She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s generalbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship ofsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet moreimprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations mustbe greater than at home.",1522
3696,"He heard her attentively, and then said,--",1522
3697,"“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some publicplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so littleexpense or inconvenience to her family as under the presentcircumstances.”",1523
3698,"“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage tous all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded andimprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure youwould judge differently in the affair.”",1524
3699,“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet.,1525
3700,“What!,1525
3701,has she frightened awaysome of your lovers?,1525

3706,"“Indeed, you are mistaken.",1526
3707,I have no such injuries to resent.,1526
3708,"It is notof peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.",1526
3709,"Ourimportance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by thewild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which markLydia’s character.",1526
3710,"Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly.",1526
3711,"If you, my dearfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, andof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business ofher life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.",1526
3712,"Her characterwill be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirtthat ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in theworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyondyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness ofher mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universalcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite.",1526
3713,In this danger Kittyis also comprehended.,1526
3714,She will follow wherever Lydia leads.,1526
3715,"Vain,ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled!",1526
3716,"Oh, my dear father, can yousuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised whereverthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in thedisgrace?”",1526
3717,"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--",1527
3718,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.",1528
3719,"Wherever you and Jane are known,you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to lessadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very sillysisters.",1528
3720,We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go toBrighton.,1528
3721,"Let her go, then.",1528
3722,"Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and willkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be anobject of prey to anybody.",1528
3723,At Brighton she will be of less importanceeven as a common flirt than she has been here.,1528
3724,The officers will findwomen better worth their notice.,1528
3725,"Let us hope, therefore, that her beingthere may teach her her own insignificance.",1528
3726,"At any rate, she cannot growmany degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the restof her life.”",1528
3727,"With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinioncontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.",1529
3728,"It was notin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.",1529
3729,"She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret overunavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of herdisposition.",1529
3730,"Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with herfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in theirunited volubility.",1530
3731,"In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprisedevery possibility of earthly happiness.",1530
3732,"She saw, with the creative eyeof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.",1530
3733,She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them atpresent unknown.,1530
3734,"She saw all the glories of the camp: its tentsstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the youngand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, shesaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least sixofficers at once.",1530
3736,“Tenderly flirting”,1532
3738,"Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects andsuch realities as these, what would have been her sensations?",1534
3739,"They couldhave been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly thesame.",1534
3740,Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for themelancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go therehimself.,1534
3741,"But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their rapturescontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leavinghome.",1535
3742,Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.,1536
3743,"Having beenfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was prettywell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.",1536
3744,"She had evenlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.",1536
3745,"In his presentbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions whichhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, afterwhat had since passed, to provoke her.",1536
3746,"She lost all concern for him infinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolousgallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel thereproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatevercause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.",1536
3747,"On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabethdisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making someinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, shementioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent threeweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.",1537
3748,"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’srecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seenhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,asked her how she had liked him.",1538
3749,Her answer was warmly in his favour.,1538
3750,"With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did yousay that he was at Rosings?”",1538
3751,“Nearly three weeks.”,1539
3752,“And you saw him frequently?”,1540
3753,"“Yes, almost every day.”",1541
3754,“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”,1542
3755,"“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”",1543
3756,"“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her.",1544
3757,"“And praymay I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it inaddress that he improves?",1544
3758,Has he deigned to add aught of civility to hisordinary style?,1544
3759,"for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and moreserious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”",1544
3760,"“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth.",1545
3761,"“In essentials, I believe, he is very muchwhat he ever was.”",1545
3762,"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether torejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning.",1546
3763,"There was asomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensiveand anxious attention, while she added,--",1546
3764,"“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean thateither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”",1547
3765,"Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitatedlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off hisembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest ofaccents,--",1548
3766,"“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readilycomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assumeeven the _appearance_ of what is right.",1549
3767,"His pride, in that direction,may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deterhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.",1549
3768,"I only fear thatthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, ismerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion andjudgment he stands much in awe.",1549
3769,"His fear of her has always operated, Iknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to hiswish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain hehas very much at heart.”",1549
3770,"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by aslight inclination of the head.",1550
3771,"She saw that he wanted to engage her onthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulgehim.",1550
3772,"The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguishElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly amutual desire of never meeting again.",1550
3773,"When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,from whence they were to set out early the next morning.",1551
3774,The separationbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.,1551
3775,Kitty was theonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.,1551
3776,"Mrs.Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss theopportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which therewas every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamoroushappiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieusof her sisters were uttered without being heard.",1551

3779,CHAPTER XLII.,1556
3781,"Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she couldnot have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domesticcomfort.",1558
3782,"Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearanceof good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married awoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early intheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her.",1558
3783,"Respect,esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views ofdomestic happiness were overthrown.",1558
3784,But Mr. Bennet was not of adisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his ownimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too oftenconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.,1558
3785,He was fond ofthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principalenjoyments.,1558
3786,To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than asher ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.,1558
3787,"This is notthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to hiswife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the truephilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.",1558
3788,"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of herfather’s behaviour as a husband.",1559
3789,"She had always seen it with pain; butrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment ofherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and tobanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligationand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her ownchildren, was so highly reprehensible.",1559
3790,"But she had never felt sostrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of sounsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arisingfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, evenif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",1559
3791,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found littleother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.",1560
3792,"Their partiesabroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother andsister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything aroundthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kittymight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbersof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose dispositiongreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all herfolly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as awatering-place and a camp.",1560
3793,"Upon the whole, therefore, she found, whathas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had lookedforward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself.",1560
3794,"It was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to havesome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for thepresent, and prepare for another disappointment.",1560
3795,"Her tour to the Lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in thescheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",1560
3796,"“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.",1561
3797,"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.",1561
3798,"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realized.",1561
3799,A scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”,1561
3800,"When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutelyto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, andalways very short.",1562
3801,"Those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officershad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, whichshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to thecamp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still lessto be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were muchtoo full of lines under the words to be made public.",1562
3802,"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.",1563
3803,Everythingwore a happier aspect.,1563
3804,"The families who had been in town for the wintercame back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.",1563
3805,"Mrs.Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middleof June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Merytonwithout tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabethhope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerablyreasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, bysome cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regimentshould be quartered in Meryton.",1563
3806,"The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letterarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent.",1564
3807,"Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London againwithin a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go sofar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it withthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give upthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to thepresent plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.",1564
3808,In thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.,1564
3809,"Thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and wherethey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,Dovedale, or the Peak.",1564
3810,Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeingthe Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.,1565
3811,But itwas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;and all was soon right again.,1565
3812,"With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.",1566
3813,It wasimpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and itsowner.,1566
3814,"“But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”",1566
3815,The period of expectation was now doubled.,1567
3816,Four weeks were to pass awaybefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival.,1567
3817,"But they did pass away, and Mr. andMrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear atLongbourn.",1567
3818,"The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and twoyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousinJane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense andsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in everyway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",1567
3819,"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the nextmorning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.",1568
3820,"Oneenjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; asuitableness which comprehended health and temper to bearinconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affectionand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there weredisappointments abroad.",1568

3822,A small part of Derbyshire is all the presentconcern.,1569
3823,"To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’sformer residence, and where she had lately learned that someacquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seenall the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles ofLambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.",1569
3824,Itwas not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it.,1569
3825,"Intalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed aninclination to see the place again.",1569
3826,"Mr. Gardiner declared hiswillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",1569

3828,"“A place, too, with which so many of youracquaintance are connected.",1570
3829,"Wickham passed all his youth there, youknow.”",1570
3830,Elizabeth was distressed.,1571
3831,"She felt that she had no business atPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.",1571
3832,"Shemust own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.",1571
3833,Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity.,1572
3834,"“If it were merely a fine houserichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but thegrounds are delightful.",1572
3835,They have some of the finest woods in thecountry.”,1572
3836,Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce.,1573
3837,"Thepossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantlyoccurred.",1573
3838,It would be dreadful!,1573
3839,"She blushed at the very idea; andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run sucha risk.",1573
3840,"But against this there were objections; and she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.",1573
3841,"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaidwhether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of itsproprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down forthe summer?",1574
3842,"A most welcome negative followed the last question; and heralarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived thenext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, andwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any disliketo the scheme.",1574

3848,"Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance ofPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turnedin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",1582
3849,"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.",1583
3850,"Theyentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.",1583
3851,"Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admiredevery remarkable spot and point of view.",1584
3852,"They gradually ascended forhalf a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught byPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into whichthe road with some abruptness wound.",1584
3853,"It was a large, handsome stonebuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of highwoody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.",1584
3854,Its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned.,1584
3855,Elizabeth was delighted.,1584
3856,"Shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.",1584
3857,They wereall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!,1584
3858,"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned.",1585
3859,She dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken.,1585
3860,"On applying to see the place, they were admitted into thehall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure towonder at her being where she was.",1585
3861,"The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much lessfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.",1586
3862,Theyfollowed her into the dining-parlour.,1586
3863,"It was a large, well-proportionedroom, handsomely fitted up.",1586
3864,"Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, wentto a window to enjoy its prospect.",1586
3865,"The hill, crowned with wood, fromwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from thedistance, was a beautiful object.",1586
3866,"Every disposition of the ground wasgood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scatteredon its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could traceit, with delight.",1586
3867,"As they passed into other rooms, these objects weretaking different positions; but from every window there were beautiesto be seen.",1586
3868,"The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furnituresuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, withadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselesslyfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than thefurniture of Rosings.",1586
3869,"“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!",1587
3870,Withthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted!,1587
3871,"Instead ofviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, andwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.",1587
3872,"But, no,” recollectingherself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost tome; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”",1587
3873,This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.,1588
3874,"She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were reallyabsent, but had not courage for it.",1589
3875,"At length, however, the question wasasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynoldsreplied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a largeparty of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey hadnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!",1589
3876,Her aunt now called her to look at a picture.,1590
3877,"She approached, and sawthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several otherminiatures, over the mantel-piece.",1590
3878,"Her aunt asked her, smilingly, howshe liked it.",1590
3879,"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was thepicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, whohad been brought up by him at his own expense.",1590
3880,"“He is now gone into thearmy,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”",1590
3881,"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could notreturn it.",1591
3882,"“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,“is my master--and very like him.",1592
3883,It was drawn at the same time as theother--about eight years ago.”,1592
3884,"“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face.",1593
3885,"But, Lizzy, you can tellus whether it is like or not.”",1593
3886,Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on thisintimation of her knowing her master.,1594
3887,“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”,1595
3888,"Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”",1596
3889,"“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”",1597
3890,"“Yes, very handsome.”",1598
3891,"“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs youwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this.",1599
3892,"This room was my latemaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used tobe then.",1599
3893,He was very fond of them.”,1599
3894,This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.,1600
3895,"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawnwhen she was only eight years old.",1601
3896,“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.,1602
3897,"“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and soaccomplished!",1603
3898,She plays and sings all day long.,1603
3899,In the next room is anew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: shecomes here to-morrow with him.”,1603
3900,"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged hercommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, eitherfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of hermaster and his sister.",1604
3901,“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”,1605
3902,"“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half histime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”",1606
3903,"“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”",1607
3904,"“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”",1608
3905,"“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.",1609
3906,I do not know who isgood enough for him.”,1609
3907,Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.,1610
3908,"Elizabeth could not help saying, “It isvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”",1610
3909,"“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knowshim,” replied the other.",1611
3910,"Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known himever since he was four years old.”",1611
3911,"This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to herideas.",1612
3912,That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.,1612
3913,"Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and wasgrateful to her uncle for saying,--",1612
3914,“There are very few people of whom so much can be said.,1613
3915,You are lucky inhaving such a master.”,1613
3916,"“Yes, sir, I know I am.",1614
3917,"If I were to go through the world, I could notmeet with a better.",1614
3918,"But I have always observed, that they who aregood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and hewas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in theworld.”",1614
3919,Elizabeth almost stared at her.,1615
3920,“Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.,1615
3921,"“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.",1616
3922,"“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--justas affable to the poor.”",1617
3923,"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.",1618
3924,Mrs.Reynolds could interest her on no other point.,1618
3925,"She related the subjectsof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of thefurniture in vain.",1618
3926,"Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of familyprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of hermaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on hismany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",1618
3927,"“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that everlived.",1619
3928,"Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing butthemselves.",1619
3929,There is not one of his tenants or servants but what willgive him a good name.,1619
3930,Some people call him proud; but I am sure I neversaw anything of it.,1619
3931,"To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattleaway like other young men.”",1619
3932,“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.,1620
3933,"“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”",1621
3934,“Perhaps we might be deceived.”,1622
3935,“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”,1623
3936,"On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very prettysitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness thanthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, whenlast at Pemberley.",1624
3937,"“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towardsone of the windows.",1625
3938,"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enterthe room.",1626
3939,"“And this is always the way with him,” she added.",1626
3940,"“Whatevercan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.",1626
3941,Thereis nothing he would not do for her.”,1626
3942,"The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, wereall that remained to be shown.",1627
3943,"In the former were many good paintings:but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been alreadyvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of MissDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, andalso more intelligible.",1627
3944,"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger.",1628
3945,Elizabeth walked on in questof the only face whose features would be known to her.,1628
3946,"At last itarrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, withsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,when he looked at her.",1628
3947,"She stood several minutes before the picture, inearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted thegallery.",1628
3948,"Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in hisfather’s lifetime.",1628
3949,"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height oftheir acquaintance.",1629
3950,The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynoldswas of no trifling nature.,1629
3951,What praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant?,1629
3952,"As a brother, a landlord, a master, sheconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!",1629
3953,Howmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!,1629
3954,How much of goodor evil must be done by him!,1629
3955,"Every idea that had been brought forward bythe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood beforethe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes uponherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitudethan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softenedits impropriety of expression.",1629
3956,"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, wereconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",1630
3957,"As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned backto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former wasconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.",1631
3958,"They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was hisappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.",1632
3959,"Their eyesinstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepestblush.",1632
3960,"He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at leastof perfect civility.",1632
3961,"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome.",1633
3962,"Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, onbeholding his master, must immediately have told it.",1633
3963,"They stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer shereturned to his civil inquiries after her family.",1633
3964,"Amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that heuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of theimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the fewminutes in which they continued together were some of the mostuncomfortable of her life.",1633
3965,"Nor did he seem much more at ease; when hespoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated hisinquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stayin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughts.",1633
3966,"At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a fewmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and tookleave.",1634
3967,"The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of hisfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her ownfeelings, followed them in silence.",1635
3968,She was overpowered by shame andvexation.,1635
3969,"Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judgedthing in the world!",1635
3970,How strange must it appear to him!,1635
3971,In what adisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man!,1635
3972,It might seem as ifshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again!,1635
3973,Oh!,1635
3974,why did she come?,1635
3975,"or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?",1635
3976,"Had they beenonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of hisdiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, thatmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage.",1635
3977,She blushed again andagain over the perverseness of the meeting.,1635
3978,"And his behaviour, sostrikingly altered,--what could it mean?",1635
3979,"That he should even speak toher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after herfamily!",1635
3980,"Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.",1635
3981,"What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, whenhe put his letter into her hand!",1635
3982,"She knew not what to think, or how toaccount for it.",1635
3983,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some timebefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemedto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, shedistinguished no part of the scene.",1636
3984,"Her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy thenwas.",1636
3985,"She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; inwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,she was still dear to him.",1636
3986,"Perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which wasnot like ease.",1636
3987,"Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeingher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her withcomposure.",1636
3988,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",1637
3989,"They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the openingof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views ofthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woodsoverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.",1638
3990,"Mr. Gardinerexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might bebeyond a walk.",1638
3991,"With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was tenmiles round.",1638
3992,"It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomedcircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent amonghanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.",1638
3993,"They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air ofthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; andthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for thestream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which borderedit.",1638
3994,"Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossedthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only ofreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible.",1638
3995,"Her niece was,therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but theirprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge thetaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the manabout them, that he advanced but little.",1638
3996,"Whilst wandering on in thisslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment wasquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcyapproaching them, and at no great distance.",1638
3997,"The walk being here lesssheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before theymet.",1638
3998,"Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for aninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak withcalmness, if he really intended to meet them.",1638
3999,"For a few moments, indeed,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.",1638
4000,"The idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; theturning past, he was immediately before them.",1638
4001,"With a glance she saw thathe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had notgot beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unluckyrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley fromher might be mischievously construed.",1638
4002,"Her colour changed, and she saidno more.",1638
4003,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.",1639
4004,"This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; andshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride hadrevolted, in his offer to herself.",1639
4005,"“What will be his surprise,” thoughtshe, “when he knows who they are!",1639
4006,He takes them now for people offashion.”,1639
4007,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named theirrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he boreit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions.",1640
4008,"That he was _surprised_ by theconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered intoconversation with Mr. Gardiner.",1640
4009,"Elizabeth could not but be pleased,could not but triumph.",1640
4010,It was consoling that he should know she had somerelations for whom there was no need to blush.,1640
4011,"She listened mostattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in everyexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,his taste, or his good manners.",1640
4012,"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcyinvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as hechose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the sametime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport.",1641
4013,"Mrs. Gardiner, who waswalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of herwonder.",1641
4014,"Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; thecompliment must be all for herself.",1641
4015,"Her astonishment, however, wasextreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered?",1641
4016,Fromwhat can it proceed?,1641
4017,"It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sakethat his manners are thus softened.",1641
4018,My reproofs at Hunsford could notwork such a change as this.,1641
4019,It is impossible that he should still loveme.”,1641
4020,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the twogentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to thebrink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.",1642
4021,"It originated inMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, foundElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferredher husband’s.",1642
4022,"Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked ontogether.",1642
4023,After a short silence the lady first spoke.,1642
4024,"She wished him toknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had beenvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before weleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected inthe country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.",1642
4025,"“Theywill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”",1642
4026,Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.,1643
4027,"Her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentionedbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind wasnot very differently engaged.",1643
4028,"“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after apause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you.",1644
4029,"Will you allowme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at Lambton?”",1644
4030,The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it.,1645
4031,"She immediately feltthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it wassatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of her.",1645
4032,They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.,1646
4033,Elizabethwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered andpleased.,1646
4034,His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind.,1646
4035,"They soon outstripped the others; and when they hadreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of amile behind.",1646
4036,"He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself nottired, and they stood together on the lawn.",1647
4037,"At such a time much mighthave been said, and silence was very awkward.",1647
4038,"She wanted to talk, butthere seemed an embargo on every subject.",1647
4039,"At last she recollected thatshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale withgreat perseverance.",1647
4040,Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patienceand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.,1647
4041,"On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go intothe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and theyparted on each side with the utmost politeness.",1648
4042,"Mr. Darcy handed theladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the house.",1648
4043,The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.,1649
4044,"“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.",1650
4045,"“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied heraunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.",1651
4046,"I can nowsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,_I_ have seen nothing of it.”",1651
4047,“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.,1652
4048,It was morethan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for suchattention.,1652
4049,His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”,1652
4050,"“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features areperfectly good.",1653
4051,But how came you to tell us that he was sodisagreeable?”,1653
4052,"Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had likedhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morning.",1654
4053,"“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” repliedher uncle.",1655
4054,"“Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take himat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, andwarn me off his grounds.”",1655
4055,"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but saidnothing.",1656
4056,"“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor Wickham.",1657
4057,He has not an ill-natured look.,1657
4058,"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks.",1657
4059,"And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.",1657
4060,"But, to be sure, thegood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!",1657
4061,I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.,1657
4062,"But he is a liberalmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehendsevery virtue.”",1657
4063,"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in asguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from hisrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, norWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.",1658
4064,"Inconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected, without actually namingher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",1658
4065,"Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think ofanything else.",1659
4066,"Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they hadno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of anintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.",1659
4067,"The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabethmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothingbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, aboveall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",1660
4069,CHAPTER XLIV.,1664
4071,"Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.",1666
4072,But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their ownarrival at Lambton these visitors came.,1666
4073,"They had been walking about theplace with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in acurricle driving up the street.",1666
4074,"Elizabeth, immediately recognizing thelivery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surpriseto her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected.",1666
4075,"Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and manyof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea onthe business.",1666
4076,"Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now feltthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from sucha quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.",1666
4077,"While thesenewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation ofElizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing.",1666
4078,"She was quite amazedat her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, shedreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much inher favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.",1666
4079,"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walkedup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.",1667
4080,"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introductiontook place.",1668
4081,With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her newacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.,1668
4082,"Since herbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy.",1668
4083,She found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllable.,1668
4084,"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, thoughlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearancewomanly and graceful.",1669
4085,"She was less handsome than her brother, but therewas sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectlyunassuming and gentle.",1669
4086,"Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her asacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was muchrelieved by discerning such different feelings.",1669
4087,"They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley wasalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express hersatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick stepwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.",1670
4088,"AllElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she stillfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffectedcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again.",1670
4089,"Heinquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, andlooked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.",1670
4090,To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personagethan to herself.,1671
4091,They had long wished to see him.,1671
4092,"The whole party beforethem, indeed, excited a lively attention.",1671
4093,"The suspicions which had justarisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towardseach with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew fromthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew whatit was to love.",1671
4094,Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little indoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration wasevident enough.,1671
4095,"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.",1672
4096,"She wanted to ascertain thefeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and tomake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where shefeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whomshe endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.",1672
4097,"Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to bepleased.",1672
4099,     “To make herself agreeable to all”,1674
4101,"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!",1676
4102,how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in alike manner.,1676
4103,"Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than onformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notionthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.",1676
4104,"But,though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to hisbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane.",1676
4105,Nolook appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.,1676
4106,Nothingoccurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.,1676
4107,"Onthis point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstancesoccurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoteda recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish ofsaying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.",1676
4108,"Heobserved to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, andin a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very longtime since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she couldreply, he added, “It is above eight months.",1676
4109,"We have not met since the26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”",1676
4110,"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwardstook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.",1677
4111,"There was not much in the question,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner whichgave them meaning.",1677
4112,"It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; butwhenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of generalcomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so farremoved from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced herthat the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived oneday.",1678
4113,"When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting thegood opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago wouldhave been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollectedtheir last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, thechange was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she couldhardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.",1678
4114,"Never, even in thecompany of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relationsat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free fromself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance couldresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even theacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would drawdown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield andRosings.",1678
4115,"Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they aroseto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressingtheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinnerat Pemberley, before they left the country.",1679
4116,"Miss Darcy, though with adiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,readily obeyed.",1679
4117,"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowinghow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to itsacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.",1679
4118,"Presuming, however,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment thanany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond ofsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage forher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",1679
4119,"Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabethagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries tomake after all their Hertfordshire friends.",1680
4120,"Elizabeth, construing allthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; andon this account, as well as some others, found herself, when theirvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with somesatisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had beenlittle.",1680
4121,"Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from heruncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear theirfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",1680
4122,But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it wasnot their wish to force her communication.,1681
4123,It was evident that she wasmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;it was evident that he was very much in love with her.,1681
4124,"They saw much tointerest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",1681
4125,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as faras their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.",1682
4126,"They couldnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his characterfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any referenceto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was knownwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy.",1682
4127,"There was now an interest,however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensiblethat the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was fouryears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to behastily rejected.",1682
4128,Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence oftheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.,1682
4129,"They hadnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market townwhere the family did not visit.",1682
4130,"It was acknowledged, however, that hewas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",1682
4131,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not heldthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with theson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-knownfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behindhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",1683
4132,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more thanthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was notlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; andshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.",1684
4133,Shecertainly did not hate him.,1684
4134,"No; hatred had vanished long ago, and shehad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,that could be so called.",1684
4135,"The respect created by the conviction of hisvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for sometime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightenedinto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in hisfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,which yesterday had produced.",1684
4136,"But above all, above respect and esteem,there was a motive within her of good-will which could not beoverlooked.",1684
4137,"It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having onceloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all thepetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all theunjust accusations accompanying her rejection.",1684
4138,"He who, she had beenpersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on thisaccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; andwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the goodopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.",1684
4139,"Sucha change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment butgratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, assuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by nomeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.",1684
4140,"She respected,she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in hiswelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare todepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of boththat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she stillpossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",1684
4141,"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, thatsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the veryday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a latebreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, bysome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that itwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the followingmorning.",1685
4142,"They were, therefore, to go.",1685
4143,"Elizabeth was pleased; though whenshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",1685
4144,Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.,1686
4145,"The fishing scheme had beenrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meetingsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.",1686
4147,     “Engaged by the river”],1689
4148,CHAPTER XLV.,1691
4150,"Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her hadoriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcomeher appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to knowwith how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would nowbe renewed.",1693
4151,"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.",1694
4152,"Its windows,opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woodyhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnutswhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.",1694
4153,"In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting therewith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived inLondon.",1695
4154,"Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended withall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and thefear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselvesinferior the belief of her being proud and reserved.",1695
4155,"Mrs. Gardiner andher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",1695
4156,"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; andon their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,succeeded for a few moments.",1696
4157,"It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, agenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kindof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of theothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help fromElizabeth, the conversation was carried on.",1696
4158,"Miss Darcy looked as if shewished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture ashort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",1696
4159,"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, withoutcalling her attention.",1697
4160,"This observation would not have prevented herfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at aninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessityof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her.",1697
4161,"She expected everymoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, shefeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whethershe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.",1697
4162,"Aftersitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing MissBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a coldinquiry after the health of her family.",1697
4163,"She answered with equalindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.",1697
4164,"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by theentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all thefinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many asignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had beengiven, to remind her of her post.",1698
4165,"There was now employment for the wholeparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and thebeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collectedthem round the table.",1698
4166,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whethershe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by thefeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though buta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began toregret that he came.",1699
4167,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three othergentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left himonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit toGeorgiana that morning.",1700
4168,"No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wiselyresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the morenecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because shesaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviourwhen he first came into the room.",1700
4169,"In no countenance was attentivecuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of thesmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of itsobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentionsto Mr. Darcy were by no means over.",1700
4170,"Miss Darcy, on her brother’sentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that hewas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.",1700

4173,They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”,1701

4176,"Had Miss Bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would haverefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discomposeElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believedher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her inDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the folliesand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected withthat corps.",1702
4177,Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’smeditated elopement.,1702
4178,"To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecywas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connectionsher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wishwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becominghereafter her own.",1702
4179,"He had certainly formed such a plan; and withoutmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from MissBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of his friend.",1702

4183,But Georgiana would not join her.,1704
4184,"Herbrother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgmentcould not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leaveGeorgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely andamiable.",1704

4190,"“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could seeany beauty in her.",1707

4194,"They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do notlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiencywithout fashion, which is intolerable.”",1707
4195,"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was notthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not alwayswise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all thesuccess she expected.",1708
4196,"He was resolutely silent, however; and, from adetermination of making him speak, she continued,--",1708
4197,"“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we allwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollectyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_a beauty!",1709
4198,"I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards sheseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty atone time.”",1709
4199,"“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I haveconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”",1710

4207,"Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter fromJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had beenrenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but onthe third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by thereceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked thatit had been mis-sent elsewhere.",1718
4208,"Elizabeth was not surprised at it, asJane had written the direction remarkably ill.",1718
4209,"They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and heruncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off bythemselves.",1719
4210,The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had beenwritten five days ago.,1719

4233,"Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowingwhat she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized theother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: ithad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.",1721
4234,"“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; Iwish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, myhead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.",1722

4237,"Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton theday before, not many hours after the express.",1722
4238,"Though Lydia’s shortletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to GretnaGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeatedto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,intending to trace their route.",1722

4246,"My father andmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.",1722
4247,"Manycircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be marriedprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?",1722
4248,Impossible!,1722
4249,"I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposedto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed myhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted.",1722

4263,"Her pale face andimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himselfenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’ssituation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.",1723

4394,"Lydia has nobrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’sbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ woulddo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, insuch a matter.”",1765

4397,"But, really, I know not what to say.",1767
4398,Perhaps I am not doing her justice.,1767

4410,"“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring.",1771

4421,"As that was thecase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could itapparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all theneighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?",1773
4422,"And even when itwas settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity ofopening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.",1773

4429,"Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particularattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”",1775
4430,"It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject byits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, duringthe whole of the journey.",1776

4433,"They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night onthe road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day.",1777

4482,"Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt tooppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged itbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they couldmost trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on thesubject.",1797

4510,My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt howimprudent a match it must be.,1807

4610,"No     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind.",1849
4611,The     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of     this.,1849

4617,"Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.",1853

4625,"There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed outas likely to give any news of him.",1855
4626,"And in the wretched state of his ownfinances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition tohis fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpiredthat he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.",1855

5078,"He had been some days in town before he was able to     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another     reason for his resolving to follow us.",2025
5079,"There is a lady, it seems, a     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though     he did not say what.",2025
5080,"She then took a large house in Edward Street,     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.",2025
5081,"This Mrs.     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.",2025
5082,But     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he     wanted.,2025
5083,"She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be     found.",2025
5084,"Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they     would have taken up their abode with her.",2025
5085,"At length, however, our     kind friend procured the wished-for direction.",2025
5086,They were in ----     Street.,2025
5087,"He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.",2025
5088,"His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,     offering his assistance as far as it would go.",2025
5089,But he found Lydia     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.,2025
5090,She cared for none     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of     leaving Wickham.,2025
5091,"She was sure they should be married some time or     other, and it did not much signify when.",2025
5092,"Since such were her     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he     easily learnt had never been _his_ design.",2025
5093,He confessed himself     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone.,2025
5094,"He meant to     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,     he could conjecture very little about it.",2025
5095,"He must go somewhere, but     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live     on.",2025
5096,Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.,2025
5097,"Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been     benefited by marriage.",2025
5098,"But he found, in reply to this question,     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making     his fortune by marriage, in some other country.",2025
5099,"Under such     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the     temptation of immediate relief.",2025
5100,"They met several times, for there     was much to be discussed.",2025
5101,"Wickham, of course, wanted more than he     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.",2025
5102,"Everything     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch     Street the evening before I came home.",2025
5103,"But Mr. Gardiner could not     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.",2025
5104,"He did     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him     till after the departure of the former.",2025
5105,"He did not leave his name,     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called     on business.",2025
5106,On Saturday he came again.,2025
5107,"Your father was gone, your     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk     together.",2025
5108,"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.",2025
5109,"It     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express     was sent off to Longbourn.",2025
5110,But our visitor was very obstinate.,2025
5111,"I     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,     after all.",2025
5112,He has been accused of many faults at different times;     but _this_ is the true one.,2025
5113,"Nothing was to be done that he did not     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have     settled the whole.",2025
5114,"They battled it together for a long time, which     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it     deserved.",2025
5115,"But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where     it was due.",2025
5116,"But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or     Jane at most.",2025
5117,"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done     for the young people.",2025
5118,"His debts are to be paid, amounting, I     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his     commission purchased.",2025
5119,"The reason why all this was to be done by him     alone, was such as I have given above.",2025
5120,"It was owing to him, to his     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been     received and noticed as he was.",2025
5121,"Perhaps there was some truth in     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_     reserve can be answerable for the event.",2025
5122,"But in spite of all this     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit     for _another interest_ in the affair.",2025
5123,"When all this was resolved     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to     receive the last finish.",2025
5124,I believe I have now told you everything.,2025
5125,It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.,2025
5126,"Lydia came to     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house.",2025
5127,"_He_ was     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no     fresh pain.",2025
5128,"I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all     the unhappiness she had brought on her family.",2025
5129,"If she heard me, it     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.",2025
5130,"I was sometimes     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,     and for their sakes had patience with her.",2025
5131,"Mr. Darcy was punctual     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.",2025
5132,"He     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on     Wednesday or Thursday.",2025
5133,"Will you be very angry with me, my dear     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold     enough to say before) how much I like him?",2025
5134,"His behaviour to us has,     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.",2025
5135,"His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his     wife may teach him.",2025
5136,I thought him very sly; he hardly ever     mentioned your name.,2025
5137,But slyness seems the fashion.,2025
5138,"Pray forgive     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I     have been all round the park.",2025
5139,A low phaeton with a nice little pair     of ponies would be the very thing.,2025
5140,But I must write no more.,2025
5141,The     children have been wanting me this half hour.,2025
5142,"“Yours, very sincerely,",2026
5143,“M.,2027
5144,GARDINER.”,2027
5145,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore thegreatest share.",2028
5146,"The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty hadproduced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward hersister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion ofgoodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to bejust, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatestextent to be true!",2028
5147,"He had followed them purposely to town, he had takenon himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such aresearch; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom hemust abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequentlymeet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he alwaysmost wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him topronounce.",2028
5148,He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regardnor esteem.,2028
5149,Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her.,2028
5150,"But itwas a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon feltthat even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on hisaffection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able toovercome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship withWickham.",2028
5151,Brother-in-law of Wickham!,2028
5152,Every kind of pride must revolt fromthe connection.,2028
5153,"He had, to be sure, done much.",2028
5154,She was ashamed to thinkhow much.,2028
5155,"But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked noextraordinary stretch of belief.",2028
5156,"It was reasonable that he should feelhe had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercisingit; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her mightassist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must bematerially concerned.",2028
5157,"It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know thatthey were under obligations to a person who could never receive areturn.",2028
5158,"They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything tohim.",2028
5159,"Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation shehad ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towardshim!",2028
5160,"For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud thatin a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the betterof himself.",2028
5161,She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again andagain.,2028
5162,It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.,2028
5163,"She was even sensibleof some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastlyboth she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidencesubsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.",2028
5164,"She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken byWickham.",2029
5165,"“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,as he joined her.",2030
5166,"“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not followthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”",2031

5211,"The quiet, theretirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas ofhappiness!",2053
5212,But it was not to be.,2053
5213,Did you ever hear Darcy mention thecircumstance when you were in Kent?”,2053
5214,"“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it wasleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”",2054
5215,“You have!,2055

5217,"“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not sopalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actuallydeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the businesshad been compromised accordingly.”",2056

5314,"“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do notknow.”",2099

5322,"She knew but littleof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardnesswhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first timeafter receiving his explanatory letter.",2102
5323,Both sisters were uncomfortableenough.,2102
5324,"Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and theirmother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to becivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by eitherof them.",2102

5326,"To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensiveinformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with aninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, aswhat Jane felt for Bingley.",2102
5327,"Her astonishment at his coming--at hiscoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in Derbyshire.",2102
5328,"The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half aminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre toher eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.",2103
5329,"“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be earlyenough for expectation.”",2104
5330,"She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring tolift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of hersister as the servant was approaching the door.",2105
5331,"Jane looked a littlepaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.",2105
5332,"On thegentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them withtolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from anysymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.",2105
5333,"Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat downagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.",2106
5334,Shehad ventured only one glance at Darcy.,2106
5335,"He looked serious as usual; and,she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than asshe had seen him at Pemberley.",2106
5336,"But, perhaps, he could not in hermother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.",2106

5341,"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a questionwhich she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything.",2109

5552,"“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much.",2199
5553,I do not deserve it.,2199
5554,"Oh,why is not everybody as happy?”",2199
5555,"Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, adelight, which words could but poorly express.",2200
5556,Every sentence ofkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.,2200
5557,"But she would notallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to besaid, for the present.",2200
5558,"“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried.",2201
5559,"“I would not on anyaccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear itfrom anyone but myself.",2201
5560,He is gone to my father already.,2201
5561,"Oh, Lizzy, toknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dearfamily!",2201
5562,how shall I bear so much happiness?”,2201
5563,"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up thecard-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.",2202
5564,"Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and easewith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so manyprevious months of suspense and vexation.",2203
5565,"“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxiouscircumspection!",2204
5566,of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!,2204
5567,"thehappiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”",2204
5568,"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with herfather had been short and to the purpose.",2205
5569,"“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.",2206
5570,“With my mother upstairs.,2207
5571,"She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”",2207
5572,"He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishesand affection of a sister.",2208
5573,Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed herdelight in the prospect of their relationship.,2208
5574,"They shook hands withgreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listento all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all hisexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had forbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition ofJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her andhimself.",2208
5575,"It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction ofMiss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, asmade her look handsomer than ever.",2209
5576,"Kitty simpered and smiled, and hopedher turn was coming soon.",2209
5577,"Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, orspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and whenMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showedhow really happy he was.",2209
5578,"Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till theirvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, heturned to his daughter and said,--",2210
5579,"“Jane, I congratulate you.",2211
5580,You will be a very happy woman.”,2211
5581,"Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for hisgoodness.",2212
5582,"“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure inthinking you will be so happily settled.",2213
5583,I have not a doubt of yourdoing very well together.,2213
5584,Your tempers are by no means unlike.,2213
5585,"You areeach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; soeasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you willalways exceed your income.”",2213
5586,“I hope not so.,2214
5587,Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would beunpardonable in _me_.”,2214
5588,“Exceed their income!,2215
5589,"My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are youtalking of?",2215
5590,"Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likelymore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am sohappy!",2215
5591,I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night.,2215
5592,I knew how itwould be.,2215
5593,"I always said it must be so, at last.",2215
5594,I was sure you could notbe so beautiful for nothing!,2215
5595,"I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, whenhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it wasthat you should come together.",2215
5596,"Oh, he is the handsomest young man thatever was seen!”",2215
5597,"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.",2216
5598,Jane was beyond competition herfavourite child.,2216
5599,At that moment she cared for no other.,2216
5600,Her youngersisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happinesswhich she might in future be able to dispense.,2216
5601,Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kittybegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.,2217
5602,"Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till aftersupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enoughdetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thoughthimself obliged to accept.",2218
5603,"Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; forwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: butshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours ofseparation that must sometimes occur.",2219
5604,"In the absence of Jane, he alwaysattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; andwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.",2219
5605,"“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that hewas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!",2220
5606,I had not believedit possible.”,2220
5607,"“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth.",2221
5608,“But how did he account forit?”,2221
5609,“It must have been his sisters’ doing.,2222
5610,"They were certainly no friends tohis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might havechosen so much more advantageously in many respects.",2222
5611,"But when they see,as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they willlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though wecan never be what we once were to each other.”",2222
5612,"“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I everheard you utter.",2223
5613,Good girl!,2223
5614,"It would vex me, indeed, to see you againthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”",2223
5615,"“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November hereally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferentwould have prevented his coming down again?”",2224
5616,"“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of hismodesty.”",2225
5617,"This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, andthe little value he put on his own good qualities.",2226
5618,"Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interferenceof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgivingheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudiceher against him.",2227
5619,“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” criedJane.,2228
5620,"“Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessedabove them all?",2228
5621,If I could but see you as happy!,2228
5622,If there were but suchanother man for you!”,2228
5623,“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.,2229
5624,"Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have yourhappiness.",2229
5625,"No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have verygood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”",2229
5626,The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long asecret.,2230
5627,"Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, andshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all herneighbours in Meryton.",2230
5628,"The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in theworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.",2231
5630,CHAPTER LVI.,2235
5632,"One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had beenformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in thedining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by thesound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up thelawn.",2237
5633,"It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, theequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.",2237
5634,"The horseswere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant whopreceded it, were familiar to them.",2237
5635,"As it was certain, however, thatsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoidthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into theshrubbery.",2237
5636,"They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining threecontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrownopen, and their visitor entered.",2237
5637,It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.,2237
5638,"They were of course all intending to be surprised: but theirastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, eveninferior to what Elizabeth felt.",2238
5639,"She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made noother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of thehead, and sat down without saying a word.",2239
5640,"Elizabeth had mentioned hername to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request ofintroduction had been made.",2239
5641,"Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of suchhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness.",2240
5642,"After sittingfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--",2240
5643,"“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.",2241
5644,"That lady, I suppose, is yourmother?”",2241
5645,Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.,2242
5646,"“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”",2243
5647,"“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.",2244
5648,“She is my youngest girl but one.,2244
5649,"My youngest of all is lately married,and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”",2244
5650,"“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after ashort silence.",2245
5651,"“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, Iassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”",2246
5652,“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening insummer: the windows are full west.”,2247
5653,"Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and thenadded,--",2248
5654,“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. andMrs. Collins well?”,2249
5655,"“Yes, very well.",2250
5656,I saw them the night before last.”,2250
5657,"Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her fromCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.",2251
5658,"But noletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.",2251
5659,"Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take somerefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--",2252
5660,"“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wildernesson one side of your lawn.",2253
5661,"I should be glad to take a turn in it, if youwill favour me with your company.”",2253
5662,"“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about thedifferent walks.",2254
5663,I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”,2254
5664,"Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,attended her noble guest downstairs.",2255
5665,"As they passed through the hall,Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour anddrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to bedecent-looking rooms, walked on.",2255
5666,"Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that herwaiting-woman was in it.",2256
5667,They proceeded in silence along the gravel walkthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort forconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent anddisagreeable.,2256
5669,“After a short survey”,2258
5671,"“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked inher face.",2260
5672,"As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the followingmanner:--",2261
5673,"“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of myjourney hither.",2262
5674,"Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why Icome.”",2262
5675,Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.,2263
5676,"“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to accountfor the honour of seeing you here.”",2264
5677,"“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought toknow that I am not to be trifled with.",2265
5678,"But however insincere _you_ maychoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.",2265
5679,"My character has ever beencelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of suchmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.",2265
5680,A report of a mostalarming nature reached me two days ago.,2265
5681,"I was told, that not only yoursister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soonafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.",2265
5682,"Though I_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure himso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved onsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known toyou.”",2265
5683,"“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouringwith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of comingso far.",2266
5684,What could your Ladyship propose by it?”,2266
5685,“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”,2267
5686,"“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabethcoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a reportis in existence.”",2268
5687,“If!,2269
5688,do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?,2269
5689,Has it not beenindustriously circulated by yourselves?,2269
5690,Do you not know that such areport is spread abroad?”,2269
5691,“I never heard that it was.”,2270
5692,"“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”",2271
5693,“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship.,2272
5694,_You_may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”,2272
5695,“This is not to be borne.,2273
5696,"Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.",2273
5697,"Hashe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”",2273
5698,“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”,2274
5699,"“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of hisreason.",2275
5700,"But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.",2275
5701,Youmay have drawn him in.”,2275
5702,"“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”",2276
5703,"“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?",2277
5704,I have not been accustomed to suchlanguage as this.,2277
5705,"I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”",2277
5706,“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour asthis ever induce me to be explicit.”,2278
5707,“Let me be rightly understood.,2279
5708,"This match, to which you have thepresumption to aspire, can never take place.",2279
5709,"No, never.",2279
5710,Mr. Darcy isengaged to _my daughter_.,2279
5711,"Now, what have you to say?”",2279
5712,"“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he willmake an offer to me.”",2280
5713,"Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--",2281
5714,“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.,2282
5715,"From their infancy,they have been intended for each other.",2282
5716,"It was the favourite wish of_his_ mother, as well as of hers.",2282
5717,"While in their cradles we planned theunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would beaccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman ofinferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied tothe family?",2282
5718,Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to histacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh?,2282
5719,Are you lost to every feeling ofpropriety and delicacy?,2282
5720,"Have you not heard me say, that from hisearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”",2282
5721,“Yes; and I had heard it before.,2283
5722,But what is that to me?,2283
5723,"If there is noother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not bekept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marryMiss de Bourgh.",2283
5724,You both did as much as you could in planning themarriage.,2283
5725,Its completion depended on others.,2283
5726,"If Mr. Darcy is neither byhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to makeanother choice?",2283
5727,"And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”",2283
5728,"“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it.",2284
5729,"Yes, MissBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family orfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.",2284
5730,"You willbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.",2284
5731,Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentionedby any of us.”,2284
5732,"“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth.",2285
5733,"“But the wife of Mr.Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarilyattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no causeto repine.”",2285
5734,"“Obstinate, headstrong girl!",2286
5735,I am ashamed of you!,2286
5736,Is this your gratitudefor my attentions to you last spring?,2286
5737,Is nothing due to me on thatscore?,2286
5738,Let us sit down.,2286
5739,"You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I camehere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will Ibe dissuaded from it.",2286
5740,I have not been used to submit to any person’swhims.,2286
5741,I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”,2286
5742,“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;but it will have no effect on _me_.”,2287
5743,“I will not be interrupted!,2288
5744,Hear me in silence.,2288
5745,My daughter and mynephew are formed for each other.,2288

5747,Their fortune onboth sides is splendid.,2288
5748,"They are destined for each other by the voice ofevery member of their respective houses; and what is to dividethem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,connections, or fortune!",2288
5749,Is this to be endured?,2288
5750,"But it must not, shallnot be!",2288

5754,“True.,2290
5755,You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter.,2290

5759,"“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew doesnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”",2291
5760,"“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”",2292
5761,"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging LadyCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after amoment’s deliberation,--",2293
5762,“I am not.”,2294
5763,Lady Catherine seemed pleased.,2295
5764,“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”,2296
5765,“I will make no promise of the kind.”,2297
5766,"“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished.",2298
5767,I expected to find a morereasonable young woman.,2298
5768,But do not deceive yourself into a belief that Iwill ever recede.,2298
5769,I shall not go away till you have given me theassurance I require.”,2298
5770,“And I certainly _never_ shall give it.,2299
5771,I am not to be intimidated intoanything so wholly unreasonable.,2299
5772,Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marryyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make_their_ marriage at all more probable?,2299
5773,"Supposing him to be attached tome, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it onhis cousin?",2299
5774,"Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments withwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been asfrivolous as the application was ill-judged.",2299
5775,"You have widely mistaken mycharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.",2299
5776,"How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself inmine.",2299
5777,"I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on thesubject.”",2299
5778,"“Not so hasty, if you please.",2300
5779,I have by no means done.,2300
5780,To all theobjections I have already urged I have still another to add.,2300
5781,I am nostranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamouselopement.,2300
5782,"I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was apatched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle.",2300
5783,And is_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister?,2300
5784,"Is _her_ husband, who is the sonof his late father’s steward, to be his brother?",2300
5785,Heaven and earth!--ofwhat are you thinking?,2300
5786,Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”,2300
5787,"“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.",2301
5788,"“You have insulted me, in every possible method.",2301

5805,"“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has anypossible claim on me, in the present instance.",2308
5806,No principle of eitherwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.,2308
5807,"And with regard to theresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’sconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join inthe scorn.”",2308
5808,“And this is your real opinion!,2309

5814,I hoped to find youreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”,2309
5815,"In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door ofthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--",2310
5816,"“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.",2311
5817,I send no compliments to yourmother.,2311
5818,You deserve no such attention.,2311
5819,I am most seriously displeased.”,2311
5820,"Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade herLadyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.",2312
5821,Sheheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs.,2312
5822,"Her motherimpatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why LadyCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.",2312
5823,"“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”",2313
5824,“She is a very fine-looking woman!,2314
5825,and her calling here was prodigiouslycivil!,2314
5826,"for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.",2314
5827,"She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing throughMeryton, thought she might as well call on you.",2314
5828,"I suppose she hadnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”",2314
5829,Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for toacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.,2315

5832,CHAPTER LVII.,2320
5834,The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threwElizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for manyhours learn to think of it less than incessantly.,2322
5835,"Lady Catherine, itappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosingsfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.Darcy.",2322
5836,"It was a rational scheme, to be sure!",2322
5837,"but from what the report oftheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when theexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supplythe idea.",2322
5838,She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of hersister must bring them more frequently together.,2322
5839,"And her neighbours atLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with theCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) hadonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ hadlooked forward to as possible at some future time.",2322
5840,"In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not helpfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persistingin this interference.",2323
5841,"From what she had said of her resolution toprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate anapplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similarrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she darednot pronounce.",2323
5842,"She knew not the exact degree of his affection for hisaunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to supposethat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and itwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt wouldaddress him on his weakest side.",2323
5843,"With his notions of dignity, he wouldprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weakand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.",2323
5844,"If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had oftenseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation mightsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignityunblemished could make him.",2324
5845,In that case he would return no more.,2324
5846,LadyCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement toBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.,2324
5847,"“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to hisfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understandit.",2325
5848,"I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of hisconstancy.",2325
5849,"If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he mighthave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret himat all.”",2325
5850,"The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor hadbeen, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the samekind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; andElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.",2326
5851,"The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by herfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.",2327
5852,"“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”",2328
5853,She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tellher was heightened by the supposition of its being in some mannerconnected with the letter he held.,2329
5854,"It suddenly struck her that it mightbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all theconsequent explanations.",2329
5855,"She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down.",2330
5856,"Hethen said,--",2330
5857,“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished meexceedingly.,2331
5858,"As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know itscontents.",2331
5859,I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brinkof matrimony.,2331
5860,Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”,2331
5861,"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneousconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explainedhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed toherself, when her father continued,--",2332
5862,“You look conscious.,2333
5863,Young ladies have great penetration in such mattersas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover thename of your admirer.,2333

5869,I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he sayson that point.,2335
5870,"What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thusoffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself onthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,of which we have been advertised by the same authority.",2335
5871,"Your daughterElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, afterher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fatemay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personagesin this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?",2335
5872,"‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything theheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, andextensive patronage.",2335
5873,"Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warnmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by aprecipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,Lizzy, who this gentleman is?",2335
5874,But now it comes out.,2335

5876,"Darcy_, you see, is the man!",2335
5877,"Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_surprised you.",2335
5878,"Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, withinthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie moreeffectually to what they related?",2335
5879,"Mr. Darcy, who never looks at anywoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ inhis life!",2335
5880,It is admirable!”,2335
5881,"Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only forceone most reluctant smile.",2336

5887,"I thought it myduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that sheand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not runhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sadbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that theirliving together before the marriage took place should be so generallyknown.",2339
5888,"I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrainfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the youngcouple into your house as soon as they were married.",2339

6052,"She had only to say inreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her ownknowledge.",2403
6053,"She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anythingelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.",2403
6054,"The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.",2404
6055,Theacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.,2404
6056,"Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happythan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,there were other evils before her.",2404
6057,She anticipated what would be felt inthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no oneliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.,2404
6058,At night she opened her heart to Jane.,2405
6059,"Though suspicion was very farfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.",2405
6060,"“You are joking, Lizzy.",2406
6061,This cannot be!,2406
6062,Engaged to Mr. Darcy!,2406
6063,"No, no,you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”",2406
6064,"“This is a wretched beginning, indeed!",2407
6065,"My sole dependence was on you;and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.",2407
6066,"Yet, indeed, Iam in earnest.",2407
6067,I speak nothing but the truth.,2407
6068,"He still loves me, and weare engaged.”",2407
6069,Jane looked at her doubtingly.,2408
6070,"“Oh, Lizzy!",2408
6071,it cannot be.,2408
6072,I know how muchyou dislike him.”,2408
6073,“You know nothing of the matter.,2409
6074,_That_ is all to be forgot.,2409
6075,Perhaps Idid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as thesea good memory is unpardonable.,2409
6076,This is the last time I shall everremember it myself.”,2409
6077,Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.,2410
6078,"Elizabeth again, and moreseriously, assured her of its truth.",2410
6079,“Good heaven!,2411
6080,can it be really so?,2411
6081,"Yet now I must believe you,” criedJane.",2411
6082,"“My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are youcertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can behappy with him?”",2411
6083,“There can be no doubt of that.,2412
6084,It is settled between us already that weare to be the happiest couple in the world.,2412
6085,"But are you pleased, Jane?",2412
6086,Shall you like to have such a brother?”,2412
6087,"“Very, very much.",2413
6088,Nothing could give either Bingley or myself moredelight.,2413
6089,"But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.",2413
6090,And do youreally love him quite well enough?,2413
6091,"Oh, Lizzy!",2413
6092,do anything rather thanmarry without affection.,2413
6093,Are you quite sure that you feel what you oughtto do?”,2413
6094,"“Oh, yes!",2414
6095,You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when Itell you all.”,2414
6096,“What do you mean?”,2415
6097,"“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley.",2416
6098,I amafraid you will be angry.”,2416
6099,"“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious.",2417
6100,I want to talk very seriously.,2417
6101,Let me know everything that I am to know without delay.,2417
6102,Will you tell mehow long you have loved him?”,2417
6103,"“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful groundsat Pemberley.”",2418
6104,"Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced thedesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances ofattachment.",2419
6105,"When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothingfurther to wish.",2419
6106,"“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.",2420
6107,Ialways had a value for him.,2420
6108,"Were it for nothing but his love of you, Imust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and yourhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.",2420
6109,"But,Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.",2420
6110,How little did youtell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton!,2420
6111,"I owe all that I knowof it to another, not to you.”",2420
6112,Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.,2421
6113,She had been unwilling tomention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had madeher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longerconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage.,2421
6114,"All was acknowledged,and half the night spent in conversation.",2421
6115,"“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the nextmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again withour dear Bingley!",2422
6116,What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be alwayscoming here?,2422
6117,"I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something orother, and not disturb us with his company.",2422
6118,What shall we do with him?,2422
6119,"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’sway.”",2422
6120,Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yetwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such anepithet.,2423
6121,"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, andshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs.",2424
6122,"Bennet, have you no more laneshereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”",2424
6123,"“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walkto Oakham Mount this morning.",2425
6124,"It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy hasnever seen the view.”",2425
6125,"“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I amsure it will be too much for Kitty.",2426
6126,"Won’t it, Kitty?”",2426
6127,Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.,2427
6128,"Darcy professed a greatcuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silentlyconsented.",2427
6129,"As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,saying,--",2427
6130,"“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have thatdisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it.",2428
6131,"It isall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking tohim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”",2428
6132,"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should beasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself theapplication for her mother’s.",2429
6133,"She could not determine how her motherwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeurwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether shewere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, itwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit toher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear thefirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of herdisapprobation.",2429
6134,"In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she sawMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it wasextreme.",2430
6135,"She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going tobe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should befilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretchedreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.",2430
6136,"In a few minuteshe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, whilepretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; hewants you in the library.” She was gone directly.",2430
6137,"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.",2431
6138,"“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing?",2431
6139,Are you out of your senses to beaccepting this man?,2431
6140,Have not you always hated him?”,2431
6141,"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been morereasonable, her expressions more moderate!",2432
6142,"It would have spared her fromexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.",2432
6143,"“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him.",2433
6144,"He is rich, to besure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.",2433
6145,But will they make you happy?”,2433
6146,"“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of myindifference?”",2434
6147,“None at all.,2435
6148,"We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; butthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”",2435
6149,"“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.",2436
6150,Indeed he has no improper pride.,2436
6151,He is perfectly amiable.,2436
6152,You do notknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him insuch terms.”,2436
6153,"“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent.",2437
6154,"He is the kindof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which hecondescended to ask.",2437
6155,"I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved onhaving him.",2437
6156,But let me advise you to think better of it.,2437
6157,"I know yourdisposition, Lizzy.",2437
6158,"I know that you could be neither happy norrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you lookedup to him as a superior.",2437
6159,Your lively talents would place you in thegreatest danger in an unequal marriage.,2437
6160,You could scarcely escapediscredit and misery.,2437
6161,"My child, let me not have the grief of seeing_you_ unable to respect your partner in life.",2437
6162,You know not what you areabout.”,2437
6163,"Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really theobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which herestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty thathis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of manymonths’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to thematch.",2438
6164,"“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more tosay.",2439
6165,"If this be the case, he deserves you.",2439
6166,"I could not have parted withyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”",2439
6167,"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcyhad voluntarily done for Lydia.",2440
6168,He heard her with astonishment.,2440
6169,"“This is an evening of wonders, indeed!",2441
6170,"And so, Darcy did everything;made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got himhis commission!",2441
6171,So much the better.,2441
6172,It will save me a world of troubleand economy.,2441
6173,"Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ havepaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their ownway.",2441
6174,"I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm abouthis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”",2441
6175,"He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his readingMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed herat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men comefor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”",2442
6176,"Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, afterhalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to jointhe others with tolerable composure.",2443
6177,"Everything was too recent forgaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longeranything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiaritywould come in time.",2443
6178,"When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,and made the important communication.",2444
6179,"Its effect was most extraordinary;for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable toutter a syllable.",2444
6180,"Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she couldcomprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit whatwas for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of alover to any of them.",2444
6181,"She began at length to recover, to fidget about inher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",2444
6182,“Good gracious!,2445
6183,Lord bless me!,2445
6184,only think!,2445
6185,dear me!,2445
6186,Mr. Darcy!,2445
6187,Who wouldhave thought it?,2445
6188,And is it really true?,2445
6189,"Oh, my sweetest Lizzy!",2445
6190,how richand how great you will be!,2445
6191,"What pin-money, what jewels, what carriagesyou will have!",2445
6192,Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all.,2445
6193,I am sopleased--so happy.,2445
6194,Such a charming man!,2445
6195,so handsome!,2445
6196,so tall!,2445
6197,"Oh, mydear Lizzy!",2445
6198,pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before.,2445
6199,Ihope he will overlook it.,2445
6200,"Dear, dear Lizzy.",2445
6201,A house in town!,2445
6202,Everythingthat is charming!,2445
6203,Three daughters married!,2445
6204,Ten thousand a year!,2445
6205,"Oh,Lord!",2445
6206,what will become of me?,2445
6207,I shall go distracted.”,2445
6208,"This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; andElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,soon went away.",2446
6209,"But before she had been three minutes in her own room,her mother followed her.",2446
6210,"“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else.",2447
6211,"Tenthousand a year, and very likely more!",2447
6212,’Tis as good as a lord!,2447
6213,And aspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.,2447
6214,"But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fondof, that I may have it to-morrow.”",2447
6215,"This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentlemanhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certainpossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’consent, there was still something to be wished for.",2448
6216,"But the morrowpassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stoodin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speakto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or markher deference for his opinion.",2448
6217,Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to getacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was risingevery hour in his esteem.,2449
6218,"“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he.",2450
6219,"“Wickham, perhaps,is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as wellas Jane’s.”",2450
6221,“The obsequious civility.”,2453
6223,CHAPTER LX.,2456
6225,"Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.",2458
6226,“How couldyou begin?” said she.,2458
6227,"“I can comprehend your going on charmingly, whenyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the firstplace?”",2458
6228,"“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, whichlaid the foundation.",2459
6229,It is too long ago.,2459
6230,I was in the middle before Iknew that I _had_ begun.”,2459
6231,"“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviourto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoketo you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.",2460
6232,"Now, besincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”",2460
6233,“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”,2461
6234,“You may as well call it impertinence at once.,2462
6235,It was very little less.,2462
6236,"The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officiousattention.",2462
6237,"You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.",2462
6238,"I roused andinterested you, because I was so unlike _them_.",2462
6239,"Had you not been reallyamiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains youtook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; andin your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduouslycourted you.",2462
6240,"There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectlyreasonable.",2462
6241,To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinksof _that_ when they fall in love.”,2462
6242,"“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she wasill at Netherfield?”",2463
6243,“Dearest Jane!,2464
6244,who could have done less for her?,2464
6245,But make a virtue of itby all means.,2464
6246,"My good qualities are under your protection, and you areto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to meto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwillingto come to the point at last?",2464
6247,"What made you so shy of me, when youfirst called, and afterwards dined here?",2464
6248,"Why, especially, when youcalled, did you look as if you did not care about me?”",2464
6249,"“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”",2465
6250,“But I was embarrassed.”,2466
6251,“And so was I.”,2467
6252,“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”,2468
6253,“A man who had felt less might.”,2469
6254,"“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and thatI should be so reasonable as to admit it!",2470
6255,"But I wonder how long you_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.",2470
6256,I wonder whenyou _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you!,2470
6257,My resolution ofthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.,2470
6258,"_Toomuch_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfortsprings from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned thesubject?",2470
6259,This will never do.”,2470
6260,“You need not distress yourself.,2471
6261,The moral will be perfectly fair.,2471
6262,LadyCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means ofremoving all my doubts.,2471
6263,I am not indebted for my present happiness toyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude.,2471
6264,I was not in a humour towait for an opening of yours.,2471
6265,"My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,and I was determined at once to know everything.”",2471
6266,"“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,for she loves to be of use.",2472
6267,"But tell me, what did you come down toNetherfield for?",2472
6268,Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?,2472
6269,or had you intended any more serious consequences?”,2472
6270,"“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether Imight ever hope to make you love me.",2473
6271,"My avowed one, or what I avowed tomyself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, andif she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”",2473
6272,“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is tobefall her?”,2474
6273,"“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.",2475
6274,But it ought tobe done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be donedirectly.”,2475
6275,"“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, andadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.",2476
6276,"ButI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”",2476
6277,"From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcyhad been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’slong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew wouldbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunthad already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote asfollows:--",2477
6278,"“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say thetruth, I was too cross to write.",2478
6279,You supposed more than really existed.,2478
6280,"But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject willafford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatlyerr.",2478
6281,"You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal morethan you did in your last.",2478
6282,"I thank you again and again, for not going tothe Lakes.",2478
6283,How could I be so silly as to wish it!,2478
6284,Your idea of theponies is delightful.,2478
6285,We will go round the park every day.,2478
6286,I am thehappiest creature in the world.,2478
6287,"Perhaps other people have said sobefore, but no one with such justice.",2478
6288,"I am happier even than Jane; sheonly smiles, I laugh.",2478

6297,"But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew.",2481
6298,He has     more to give.,2481
6299,"“Yours sincerely,” etc.",2482
6300,Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approachingmarriage were all that was affectionate and insincere.,2483
6301,"She wrote even toJane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her formerprofessions of regard.",2483
6302,"Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; andthough feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a muchkinder answer than she knew was deserved.",2483
6303,The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information wasas sincere as her brother’s in sending it.,2484
6304,"Four sides of paper wereinsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire ofbeing loved by her sister.",2484
6305,"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulationsto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that theCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge.",2485
6306,The reason of thissudden removal was soon evident.,2485
6307,"Lady Catherine had been rendered soexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, thatCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away tillthe storm was blown over.",2485
6308,"At such a moment, the arrival of her friendwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of theirmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when shesaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of herhusband.",2485
6309,"He bore it, however, with admirable calmness.",2485
6310,"He could evenlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying awaythe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their allmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure.",2485
6311,"If he didshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.",2485
6312,"Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on hisforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood intoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’sgood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must bevulgar.",2486
6313,"Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, atall likely to make her more elegant.",2486
6314,"Elizabeth did all she could toshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious tokeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he mightconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelingsarising from all this took from the season of courtship much of itspleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forwardwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society solittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of theirfamily party at Pemberley.",2486
6316,CHAPTER LXI.,2490
6318,Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet gotrid of her two most deserving daughters.,2492
6319,"With what delighted pride sheafterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may beguessed.",2492
6320,"I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that theaccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many ofher children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domesticfelicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervousand invariably silly.",2492
6321,Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for herdrew him oftener from home than anything else could do.,2493
6322,"He delighted ingoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.",2493
6323,Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.,2494
6324,"So neara vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.",2494
6325,"The darling wish of hissisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring countyto Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other sourceof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",2494
6326,"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time withher two elder sisters.",2495
6327,"In society so superior to what she had generallyknown, her improvement was great.",2495
6328,"She was not of so ungovernable atemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, shebecame, by proper attention and management, less irritable, lessignorant, and less insipid.",2495
6329,"From the further disadvantage of Lydia’ssociety she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickhamfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise ofballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.",2495
6330,Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarilydrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quiteunable to sit alone.,2496
6331,"Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, butshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was nolonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change withoutmuch reluctance.",2496
6332,"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution fromthe marriage of her sisters.",2497
6333,"He bore with philosophy the conviction thatElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitudeand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite ofeverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet beprevailed on to make his fortune.",2497
6334,"The congratulatory letter whichElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, byhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.",2497
6335,Theletter was to this effect:--,2497
6336,"     /* “My dear Lizzy, */",2498
6337,     “I wish you joy.,2499
6338,"If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear     Wickham, you must be very happy.",2499
6339,"It is a great comfort to have you     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will     think of us.",2499
6340,I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live     upon without some help.,2499
6341,"Any place would do of about three or four     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,     if you had rather not.",2499
6342,"“Yours,” etc.",2500
6343,"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured inher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.",2501
6344,"Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practiceof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, shefrequently sent them.",2501
6345,"It had always been evident to her that such anincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant intheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient totheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane orherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towardsdischarging their bills.",2501
6346,"Their manner of living, even when therestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in theextreme.",2501
6347,"They were always moving from place to place in quest of acheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.",2501
6348,"His affectionfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims toreputation which her marriage had given her.",2501
6349,"Though Darcy could neverreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted himfurther in his profession.",2501
6350,"Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, whenher husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with theBingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that evenBingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_of giving them a hint to be gone.",2501
6351,"Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as shethought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, shedropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost asattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civilityto Elizabeth.",2502
6352,Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisterswas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.,2503
6353,"They were able to love eachother, even as well as they intended.",2503
6354,"Georgiana had the highest opinionin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with anastonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner oftalking to her brother.",2503
6355,"He, who had always inspired in herself a respectwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of openpleasantry.",2503
6356,Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen inher way.,2503
6357,"By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that awoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will notalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.",2503
6358,"Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, inher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent himlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some timeall intercourse was at an end.",2504
6359,"But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, herresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosityto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait onthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods hadreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but thevisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.",2504
6360,With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms.,2505
6361,"Darcy,as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both eversensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringingher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.",2505
6363,                                  THE                                  END                                   ],2507
