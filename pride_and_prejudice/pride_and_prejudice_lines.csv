1,[Illustration],1
2,_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving,3
3,by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies,3
4,to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very,3
5,"numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it",3
6,brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as,3
7,to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by,3
8,"allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and",3
9,proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet,3
10,"unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be",3
11,found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the,3
12,novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger,3
13,"Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted",3
14,"critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that",3
15,"of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with",3
16,"difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling",3
17,"in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite",3
18,delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly,3
19,"theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost",3
20,wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that,3
21,"Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might",3
22,very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;,3
23,yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and,3
24,"others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and",3
25,Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does,3
26,not want them._,3
27,"_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes",4
28,"would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present",4
29,book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss,4
30,Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge,4
31,"of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the",4
32,more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather,4
33,"more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most",4
34,"peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the",4
35,"Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,",4
36,"I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It",4
37,"seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most",4
38,eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention,4
39,"in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show",4
40,cause._,4
41,"_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the",5
42,"reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,",5
43,when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and,5
44,"finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till",5
45,"1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this",5
46,"combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the",5
47,"critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct",5
48,"superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it",5
49,"possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost",5
50,"regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident",5
51,could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia,5
52,"and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de",5
53,théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the,5
54,"story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.",5
55,"All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.",5
56,"Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the",5
57,"same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the",5
58,"hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between",5
59,Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the,5
60,"intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think",5
61,the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen,5
62,"always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her",5
63,opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to,5
64,"be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly",5
65,natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given,5
66,"by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from",5
67,the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive,5
68,aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of,5
69,the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare,5
70,"say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or",5
71,"garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and",5
72,"delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would",5
73,"certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,",5
74,"which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can",5
75,"avail himself, appear at once on the stage._",5
76,"_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to",6
77,"more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest",6
78,"merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts",6
79,and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it,6
80,"will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite",6
81,consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built,6
82,"novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which",6
83,displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all,6
84,faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot,6
85,acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the,6
86,"ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one",6
87,should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what,6
88,seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her,6
89,faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John,6
90,"Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,",6
91,"but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still",6
92,superior to them._,6
93,_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate,7
94,"that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to",7
95,"express, and at any particular time likely to be differently",7
96,apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a,7
97,"greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of",7
98,the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of,7
99,"scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,",7
100,"obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,",7
101,"for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in",7
102,"Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was",7
103,masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of,7
104,"common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,",7
105,avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a,7
106,certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those,7
107,who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the,7
108,"savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness",7
109,"of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that",7
110,"her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much",7
111,"protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a",7
112,"restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in",7
113,"roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,",7
114,"of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early",7
115,"nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,",7
116,would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate,7
117,"husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the",7
118,"innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play",7
119,at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel,7
120,"of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected",7
121,Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been,7
122,written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the,7
123,"days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I",7
124,think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s,7
125,"own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over",7
126,her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the,7
127,"English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous",7
128,"falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and",7
129,"snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means",7
130,"the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells",7
131,"beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and",7
132,"that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then",7
133,"every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a",7
134,"fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is",7
135,a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even,7
136,"have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she",7
137,"took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at",7
138,"work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,",7
139,"and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she",7
140,was immensely the better for it as an artist._,7
141,"_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed",8
142,"that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,",8
143,combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that,8
144,we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature,8
145,painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the,8
146,"term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling",8
147,"at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than",8
148,of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should,8
149,myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a,8
150,"microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the",8
151,littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to,8
152,paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not,8
153,feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very,8
154,"short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not",8
155,"much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a",8
156,single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her,8
157,composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly,8
158,anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century,8
159,seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott,8
160,"required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and",8
161,German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an,8
162,"English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when",8
163,ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might,8
164,"pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the",8
165,"gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were",8
166,subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which,8
167,Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular,8
168,"taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost",8
169,touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey,8
170,even in a black one._,8
171,"_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which",9
172,"only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the",9
173,"first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are",9
174,"true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she",9
175,"has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes",9
176,the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any,9
177,"Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously",9
178,piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get,9
179,"none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can",9
180,shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the,9
181,"myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.",9
182,Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book,9
183,only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.,9
184,Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have,9
185,"stirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_",9
186,"himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the",9
187,breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with,9
188,"just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I",9
189,"should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her",9
190,to Addison in others._,9
191,_This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears,10
192,"nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.",10
193,Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison,10
194,"ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has",10
195,"been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he",10
196,"_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds",10
197,"of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and",10
198,"distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,",10
199,to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at,10
200,the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we,10
201,"possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first",10
202,"draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The",10
203,"formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait",10
204,"is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.",10
205,"Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the",10
206,"“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain",10
207,"side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century",10
208,"humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,",10
209,"its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,",10
210,"its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech",10
211,or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled,10
212,"with reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions",10
213,are historically true._,10
214,_But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily,11
215,exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the,11
216,"figures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like",11
217,"Mr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,",11
218,"perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me",11
219,very faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible,11
220,"to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble",11
221,"birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,",11
222,"as Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady",11
223,"Powerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,",11
224,"rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of",11
225,developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present,11
226,"themselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even",11
227,"Miss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him",11
228,"for the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must",11
229,"always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her",11
230,or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but,11
231,"the ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,",11
232,except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of,11
233,"the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the",11
234,"consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that",11
235,even Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is,11
236,"difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,",11
237,or when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of,11
238,the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his,11
239,"consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,",11
240,do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.,11
241,Let us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry,11
242,to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just,11
243,"related as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these",11
244,"pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the",11
245,result of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s,11
246,"readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by",11
247,"the readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as",11
248,they are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction,11
249,outside of these four._,11
250,_The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been,12
251,"already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties",12
252,"difficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have",12
253,"glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely",12
254,amusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and,12
255,"Lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have",12
256,differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and,12
257,vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common,12
258,"weaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has",12
259,"taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;",12
260,"not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting",12
261,"traditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming",12
262,her privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of,12
263,"first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and",12
264,"singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but",12
265,perhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings,12
266,in that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not,12
267,to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and,12
268,"respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.",12
269,"Collins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish",12
270,that the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite,12
271,"these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe",12
272,poor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._,12
273,"_The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de",13
274,"Bourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,",13
275,"further than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though",13
276,"delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between",13
277,"comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and",13
278,that Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in,13
279,dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in,13
280,"drab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet",13
281,"not disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with",13
282,a cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the,13
283,hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._,13
284,_Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of,14
285,"Miss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,",14
286,whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into,14
287,"comparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is",14
288,"unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while",14
289,his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I,14
290,cannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which,14
291,"his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and",14
292,"nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its",14
293,sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s,14
294,scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in,14
295,even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of,14
296,his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he,14
297,"been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting",14
298,"under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come",14
299,husband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the,14
300,"probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really",14
301,"injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in",14
302,"love, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that",14
303,"phenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,",14
304,only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal,14
305,charm._,14
306,"_The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen",15
307,"herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather",15
308,to be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_,15
309,allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was,15
310,always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and,15
311,"except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate",15
312,"sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing",15
313,about her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the,15
314,lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost,15
315,"strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and",15
316,secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her,15
317,propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give,15
318,at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never,15
319,"“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest",15
320,obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early,15
321,"speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to",15
322,"serious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,",15
323,"as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the",15
324,"final ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then",15
325,too she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself,15
326,or anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with,15
327,"as personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of",15
328,this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same,15
329,"kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have",15
330,been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons,15
331,who ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the,15
332,injury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family,15
333,aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._,15
334,"_Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a",16
335,"common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her",16
336,"playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a",16
337,certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.,16
338,Nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent,16
339,Darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the,16
340,"idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.",16
341,"Elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the",16
342,"“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)",16
343,"women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea",16
344,"that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with",16
345,"her if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”",16
346,"she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of",16
347,passion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so,16
348,"invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of",16
349,"these qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.",16
350,"But I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have",16
351,"married Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and",16
352,anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’,16
353,conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked,16
354,"to the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della",16
355,Cruscans of this._,16
356,"_And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of",17
357,charm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic,17
358,exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In,17
359,the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young,17
360,ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at,17
361,"least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can",17
362,"help doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth",17
363,"Bennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara",17
364,Grant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I,17
365,"should, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana",17
366,"and Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one",17
367,of the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._,17

370,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession",21
371,of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.,21
372,However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his,22
373,"first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds",22
374,"of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful",22
375,property of some one or other of their daughters.,22
376,"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that",23
377,Netherfield Park is let at last?”,23
378,Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.,24
379,"“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she",25
380,told me all about it.”,25
381,Mr. Bennet made no answer.,26
382,"“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.",27
383,"“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”",28
384,[Illustration:,29
385,“He came down to see the place”,30
386,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],31
387,This was invitation enough.,32
388,"“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken",33
389,by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came,33
390,"down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much",33
391,delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is,33
392,"to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be",33
393,in the house by the end of next week.”,33
394,“What is his name?”,34
395,“Bingley.”,35
396,“Is he married or single?”,36
397,"“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or",37
398,five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”,37
399,“How so? how can it affect them?”,38
400,"“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You",39
401,must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”,39
402,“Is that his design in settling here?”,40
403,"“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he",41
404,"_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as",41
405,soon as he comes.”,41
406,“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send,42
407,"them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are",42
408,"as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the",42
409,party.”,42
410,"“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but",43
411,I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five,43
412,"grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”",43
413,"“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”",44
414,"“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into",45
415,the neighbourhood.”,45
416,"“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”",46
417,“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would,47
418,"be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,",47
419,"merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new",47
420,"comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit",47
421,"him, if you do not.”",47
422,"“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very",48
423,glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my,48
424,hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though,48
425,I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”,48
426,“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the,49
427,"others: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so",49
428,good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”,49
429,"“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are",50
430,all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of,50
431,quickness than her sisters.”,50
432,"“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take",51
433,delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”,51
434,"“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They",52
435,are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration,52
436,these twenty years at least.”,52
437,"“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”",53
438,"“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four",54
439,thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”,54
440,"“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not",55
441,visit them.”,55
442,"“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them",56
443,all.”,56
444,"Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,",57
445,"reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had",57
446,been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind,57
447,"was less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,",57
448,"little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she",57
449,fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her,57
450,daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.,57

457,[Illustration],71
458,Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He,72
459,"had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his",72
460,wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was,72
461,paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following,72
462,"manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he",72
463,"suddenly addressed her with,--",72
464,"“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”",73
465,"“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,",74
466,"resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”",74
467,"“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the",75
468,"assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”",75
469,“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces,76
470,"of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion",76
471,of her.”,76
472,"“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do",77
473,not depend on her serving you.”,77
474,"Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain",78
475,"herself, began scolding one of her daughters.",78
476,"“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little",79
477,compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”,79
478,"“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times",80
479,them ill.”,80
480,"“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When",81
481,"is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”",81
482,“To-morrow fortnight.”,82
483,"“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till",83
484,"the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for",83
485,she will not know him herself.”,83
486,"“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce",84
487,Mr. Bingley to _her_.”,84
488,"“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him",85
489,myself; how can you be so teasing?”,85
490,“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly,86
491,very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a,86
492,"fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after",86
493,"all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,",86
494,"as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I",86
495,will take it on myself.”,86
496,"The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,",87
497,nonsense!”,87
498,“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do,88
499,"you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on",88
500,"them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,",88
501,"Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read",88
502,"great books, and make extracts.”",88
503,"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.",89
504,"“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.",90
505,Bingley.”,90
506,"“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.",91
507,“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I,92
508,"had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on",92
509,"him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we",92
510,cannot escape the acquaintance now.”,92
511,The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.,93
512,Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy,93
513,"was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the",93
514,while.,93
515,"“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should",94
516,persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to,94
517,"neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a",94
518,"good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a",94
519,word about it till now.”,94
520,"“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,",95
521,"as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",95
522,"“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was",96
523,shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;,96
524,"or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so",96
525,"pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but",96
526,"for your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_",96
527,"the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next",96
528,ball.”,96
529,"“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the",97
530,"youngest, I’m the tallest.”",97
531,The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would,98
532,"return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to",98
533,dinner.,98

540,"Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five",111
541,"daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her",111
542,husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him,111
543,"in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and",111
544,distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at,111
545,"last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,",111
546,Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been,111
547,"delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely",111
548,"agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly",111
549,with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of,111
550,dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively,111
551,hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.,111
552,"“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”",112
553,"said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well",112
554,"married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”",112
555,"In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten",113
556,minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being,113
557,"admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard",113
558,much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more,113
559,"fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper",113
560,"window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.",113
561,An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had,114
562,Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her,114
563,"housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley",114
564,"was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to",114
565,"accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite",114
566,disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town,114
567,so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that,114
568,"he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never",114
569,settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a,114
570,little by starting the idea of his,114
571,[Illustration:,115
572,     “When the Party entered”,116
573,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],117
574,being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a,118
575,report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and,118
576,seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a,118
577,number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,118
578,"that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,",118
579,his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the,118
580,"assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his",118
581,"two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.",118
582,Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant,119
583,"countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,",119
584,"with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely",119
585,looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention,119
586,"of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and",119
587,"the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after",119
588,"his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen",119
589,"pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was",119
590,"much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great",119
591,"admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust",119
592,which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be,119
593,"proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his",119
594,"large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,",119
595,"disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his",119
596,friend.,119
597,Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal,120
598,"people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,",120
599,"was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one",120
600,himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for,120
601,themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced,120
602,"only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being",120
603,"introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in",120
604,"walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.",120
605,"His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in",120
606,"the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",120
607,"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of",120
608,his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his,120
609,having slighted one of her daughters.,120
610,"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit",121
611,"down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been",121
612,standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and,121
613,"Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his",121
614,friend to join it.,121
615,"“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you",122
616,standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better,122
617,dance.”,122
618,"“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am",123
619,"particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it",123
620,"would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not",123
621,another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to,123
622,stand up with.”,123
623,"“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a",124
624,"kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my",124
625,"life as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,",124
626,uncommonly pretty.”,124
627,"“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.",125
628,"Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.",125
629,"“Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one",126
630,"of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I",126
631,dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”,126
632,[Illustration:,127
633,“She is tolerable”,128
634,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],129
635,"“Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at",130
636,"Elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,",130
637,“She is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I am in no,130
638,humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted,130
639,by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her,130
640,"smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”",130
641,Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth,131
642,"remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,",131
643,"however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,",131
644,"playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.",131
645,The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.,132
646,Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield,132
647,"party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been",132
648,distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her,132
649,"mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s",132
650,pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most,132
651,accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been,132
652,"fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they",132
653,"had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good",132
654,"spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they",132
655,were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a,132
656,"book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a",132
657,good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised,132
658,such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s,132
659,views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he,132
660,had a very different story to hear.,132
661,"“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most",133
662,"delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.",133
663,"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well",133
664,"she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with",133
665,"her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her",133
666,twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second,133
667,"time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand",133
668,"up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody",133
669,"can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going",133
670,"down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and",133
671,"asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss",133
672,"King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane",133
673,"again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”",133
674,"“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,",134
675,"“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of",134
676,his partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”,134
677,"“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He",135
678,is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never,135
679,in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the,135
680,lace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”,135
681,Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any,136
682,description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch,136
683,"of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some",136
684,"exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",136
685,"“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not",137
686,"suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at",137
687,"all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring",137
688,"him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very",137
689,"great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my",137
690,"dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”",137
691,[Illustration],141
692,CHAPTER IV.,145
693,[Illustration],147
694,"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in",148
695,"her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much",148
696,she admired him.,148
697,"“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,",149
698,"good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,",149
699,with such perfect good breeding!”,149
700,"“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought",150
701,likewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”,150
702,“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I,151
703,did not expect such a compliment.”,151
704,“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between,152
705,"us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What",152
706,could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help,152
707,seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in,152
708,"the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is",152
709,"very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a",152
710,stupider person.”,152
711,“Dear Lizzy!”,153
712,"“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.",154
713,You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable,154
714,in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”,154
715,“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak,155
716,what I think.”,155
717,“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_,156
718,"good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of",156
719,others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it,156
720,"everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the",156
721,"good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing",156
722,"of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,",156
723,"too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”",156
724,"“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you",157
725,"converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep",157
726,his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming,157
727,neighbour in her.”,157
728,"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at",158
729,the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more,158
730,"quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and",158
731,"with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was",158
732,"very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine",158
733,"ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the",158
734,power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.,158
735,They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private,158
736,seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the,158
737,"habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people",158
738,"of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of",158
739,themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in,158
740,the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their,158
741,memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been,158
742,acquired by trade.,158
743,Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred,159
744,"thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,",159
745,"but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and",159
746,"sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a",159
747,"good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those",159
748,"who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the",159
749,"remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to",159
750,purchase.,159
751,His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,160
752,"though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no",160
753,"means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had",160
754,"married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider",160
755,his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of,160
756,"age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to",160
757,"look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an",160
758,"hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied",160
759,"with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.",160
760,"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a",161
761,great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the,161
762,"easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition",161
763,"could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he",161
764,"never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley",161
765,"had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In",161
766,"understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means",161
767,"deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,",161
768,"reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not",161
769,inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley,161
770,was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually,161
771,giving offence.,161
772,The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently,162
773,characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier,162
774,girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;,162
775,"there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted",162
776,"with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel",162
777,"more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people",162
778,"in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had",162
779,"felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or",162
780,pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too,162
781,much.,162
782,Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired,163
783,"her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom",163
784,they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore,163
785,established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such,163
786,commendation to think of her as he chose.,163
787,[Illustration: [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],167
788,CHAPTER V.,171
789,[Illustration],173
790,Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets,174
791,were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade,174
792,"in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the",174
793,honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The,174
794,"distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a",174
795,disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;,174
796,"and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about",174
797,"a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he",174
798,"could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by",174
799,"business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,",174
800,"though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the",174
801,"contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,",174
802,"friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him",174
803,courteous.,174
804,"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a",175
805,valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest,175
806,"of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was",175
807,Elizabeth’s intimate friend.,175
808,That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a,176
809,ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly,176
810,brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.,176
811,"“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil",177
812,"self-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”",177
813,“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”,178
814,"“Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be",179
815,"sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he",179
816,_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something,179
817,about Mr. Robinson.”,179
818,“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not,180
819,I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton,180
820,"assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty",180
821,"women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his",180
822,"answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,",180
823,beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”,180
824,"“Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as",181
825,"if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”",181
826,"“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said",182
827,"Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,",182
828,is he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”,182
829,“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his,183
830,"ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite",183
831,a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he,183
832,sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”,183
833,[Illustration: “Without once opening his lips”,184
834,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],185
835,"“Are you quite sure, ma’am? Is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.",186
836,“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”,186
837,"“Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he",187
838,could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being,187
839,spoke to.”,187
840,"“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless",188
841,among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably,188
842,agreeable.”,188
843,"“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very",189
844,"agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it",189
845,"was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had",189
846,"heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come",189
847,to the ball in a hack chaise.”,189
848,"“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I",190
849,wish he had danced with Eliza.”,190
850,"“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,",191
851,if I were you.”,191
852,"“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”",192
853,"“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride",193
854,"often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so",193
855,"very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,",193
856,"should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_",193
857,to be proud.”,193
858,"“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive",194
859,"_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”",194
860,"“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her",195
861,"reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have",195
862,"ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human",195
863,"nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us",195
864,who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some,195
865,"quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different",195
866,"things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be",195
867,proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of,195
868,ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”,195
869,"“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his",196
870,"sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of",196
871,"foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”",196
872,"“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.",197
873,"Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle",197
874,directly.”,197
875,The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she,198
876,would; and the argument ended only with the visit.,198
877,[Illustration],199
878,[Illustration],203
879,CHAPTER VI.,207
880,[Illustration],209
881,The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit,210
882,was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the,210
883,good-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was,210
884,"found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,",210
885,a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the,210
886,two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest,210
887,pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of,210
888,"everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;",210
889,"though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,",210
890,"in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It",210
891,"was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and",210
892,to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference,210
893,"which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a",210
894,way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it,210
895,"was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane",210
896,"united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an",210
897,"uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the",210
898,"suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss",210
899,Lucas.,210
900,"“It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose",211
901,on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be,211
902,so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill,211
903,"from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and",211
904,it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the,211
905,dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every,211
906,"attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all",211
907,_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are,211
908,very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without,211
909,"encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_",211
910,affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he,211
911,"may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”",211
912,"“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can",212
913,"perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to",212
914,discover it too.”,212
915,"“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”",213
916,"“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal",214
917,"it, he must find it out.”",214
918,"“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane",215
919,"meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they",215
920,"always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that",215
921,every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should,215
922,therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his,215
923,"attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling",215
924,in love as much as she chooses.”,215
925,"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in",216
926,question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined,216
927,"to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But",216
928,these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she,216
929,"cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its",216
930,reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four,216
931,"dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,",216
932,and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite,216
933,enough to make her understand his character.”,216
934,"“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might",217
935,only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must,217
936,remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four,217
937,evenings may do a great deal.”,217
938,“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both,218
939,"like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other",218
940,"leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”",218
941,"“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if",219
942,"she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a",219
943,chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a,219
944,twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If,219
945,"the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or",219
946,"ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the",219
947,least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to,219
948,have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as,219
949,possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your,219
950,life.”,219
951,"“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not",220
952,"sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”",220
953,"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth",221
954,was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some,221
955,interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely,221
956,allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the,221
957,"ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no",221
958,sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had,221
959,"hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered",221
960,uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To,221
961,this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had,221
962,detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry,221
963,"in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and",221
964,pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those,221
965,"of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of",221
966,this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made,221
967,"himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough",221
968,to dance with.,221
969,"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing",222
970,"with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so",222
971,"drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were",222
972,assembled.,222
973,"“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my",223
974,conversation with Colonel Forster?”,223
975,“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”,224
976,"“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see",225
977,"what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by",225
978,"being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”",225
979,[Illustration: “The entreaties of several” [_Copyright 1894 by George,226
980,Allen._]],226
981,"On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have",227
982,"any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such",227
983,"a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she",227
984,"turned to him and said,--",227
985,"“Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well",228
986,"just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at",228
987,Meryton?”,228
988,“With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady,229
989,energetic.”,229
990,“You are severe on us.”,230
991,"“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going",231
992,"to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”",231
993,“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me,232
994,to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a,232
995,"musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would",232
996,really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of,232
997,"hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,",232
998,"she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing",232
999,"at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is",232
1000,"of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and",232
1001,I shall keep mine to swell my song.”,232
1002,"Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song",233
1003,"or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she",233
1004,"would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her",233
1005,"sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in",233
1006,"the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always",233
1007,impatient for display.,233
1008,Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her,234
1009,"application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited",234
1010,"manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she",234
1011,"had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with",234
1012,"much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the",234
1013,"end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by",234
1014,"Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with",234
1015,"some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in",234
1016,dancing at one end of the room.,234
1017,Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of,235
1018,"passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too",235
1019,much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas,235
1020,"was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--",235
1021,"“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is",236
1022,"nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first",236
1023,refinements of polished societies.”,236
1024,"“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst",237
1025,the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”,237
1026,"Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he",238
1027,"continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt",238
1028,"not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”",238
1029,"“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”",239
1030,"“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do",240
1031,you often dance at St. James’s?”,240
1032,"“Never, sir.”",241
1033,“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”,242
1034,“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”,243
1035,"“You have a house in town, I conclude?”",244
1036,Mr. Darcy bowed.,245
1037,"“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of",246
1038,superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of,246
1039,London would agree with Lady Lucas.”,246
1040,He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to,247
1041,"make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was",247
1042,"struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to",247
1043,"her,--",247
1044,"“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow",248
1045,me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You,248
1046,"cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”",248
1047,"And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though",248
1048,"extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly",248
1049,"drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--",248
1050,"“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you",249
1051,not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”,249
1052,"Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of",250
1053,"her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at",250
1054,all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.,250
1055,"“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me",251
1056,the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the,251
1057,"amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us",251
1058,for one half hour.”,251
1059,"“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.",252
1060,"“He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we",253
1061,cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a,253
1062,partner?”,253
1063,"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured",254
1064,"her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some",254
1065,"complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--",254
1066,“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”,255
1067,“I should imagine not.”,256
1068,“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many,257
1069,"evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of",257
1070,"your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the",257
1071,"noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these",257
1072,people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”,257
1073,"“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more",258
1074,agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure,258
1075,which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”,258
1076,"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he",259
1077,would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.,259
1078,"Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--",259
1079,“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”,260
1080,“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.,261
1081,How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you,261
1082,joy?”,261
1083,“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s,262
1084,"imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love",262
1085,"to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”",262
1086,"“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as",263
1087,"absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and",263
1088,of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”,263
1089,"He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to",264
1090,entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her,264
1091,"that all was safe, her wit flowed along.",264

1095,CHAPTER VII.,274
1096,[Illustration],276
1097,Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two,277
1098,"thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,",277
1099,"in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s",277
1100,"fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply",277
1101,"the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and",277
1102,had left her four thousand pounds.,277
1103,"She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their",278
1104,"father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in",278
1105,London in a respectable line of trade.,278
1106,The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most,279
1107,"convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted",279
1108,"thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and",279
1109,"to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,",279
1110,"Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:",279
1111,"their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing",279
1112,"better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning",279
1113,"hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of",279
1114,"news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn",279
1115,"some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both",279
1116,with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in,279
1117,"the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was",279
1118,the head-quarters.,279
1119,Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting,280
1120,intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the,280
1121,"officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,",280
1122,and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips,280
1123,"visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity",280
1124,unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.,280
1125,"Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their",280
1126,"mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of",280
1127,an ensign.,280
1128,"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.",281
1129,"Bennet coolly observed,--",281
1130,"“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two",282
1131,"of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but",282
1132,I am now convinced.”,282
1133,"Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect",283
1134,"indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and",283
1135,"her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the",283
1136,next morning to London.,283
1137,"“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so",284
1138,ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly,284
1139,"of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”",284
1140,"“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”",285
1141,"“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”",286
1142,"“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I",287
1143,"had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must",287
1144,so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly,287
1145,foolish.”,287
1146,"“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of",288
1147,"their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will",288
1148,not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I,288
1149,"liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my",288
1150,"heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,",288
1151,"should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought",288
1152,Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in,288
1153,his regimentals.”,288
1154,"“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain",289
1155,Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first,289
1156,came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”,289
1157,Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a,290
1158,"note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited",290
1159,"for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was",290
1160,"eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--",290
1161,"“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,",291
1162,"Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”",291
1163,"“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.",292
1164,"     /* NIND “My dear friend, */",293
1165,     “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and,294
1166,"     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our",294
1167,     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never,294
1168,     end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of,294
1169,     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.,294
1170,"     Yours ever,",294
1171,“CAROLINE BINGLEY.”,295
1172,“With the officers!” cried Lydia: “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of,296
1173,_that_.”,296
1174,"“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”",297
1175,“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.,298
1176,"“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to",299
1177,rain; and then you must stay all night.”,299
1178,"“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that",300
1179,they would not offer to send her home.”,300
1180,"“Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;",301
1181,and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”,301
1182,“I had much rather go in the coach.”,302
1183,"“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are",303
1184,"wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”",303
1185,[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics],304
1186,“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”,305
1187,"“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose",306
1188,will be answered.”,306
1189,She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses,307
1190,"were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her",307
1191,mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad,307
1192,day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it,307
1193,"rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was",307
1194,delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;,307
1195,Jane certainly could not come back.,307
1196,"“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than",308
1197,"once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next",308
1198,"morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her",308
1199,contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield,308
1200,brought the following note for Elizabeth:--,308
1201,"     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */",309
1202,"     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be",310
1203,     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will,310
1204,     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on,310
1205,     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear,310
1206,"     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a",310
1207,"     headache, there is not much the matter with me.",310
1208,"“Yours, etc.”",311
1209,"“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note",312
1210,"aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she",312
1211,should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of,312
1212,"Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”",312
1213,"“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little",313
1214,trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays,313
1215,"there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the",313
1216,carriage.”,313
1217,"Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the",314
1218,"carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was",314
1219,her only alternative. She declared her resolution.,314
1220,"“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a",315
1221,"thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get",315
1222,there.”,315
1223,“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”,316
1224,"“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the",317
1225,horses?”,317
1226,"“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,",318
1227,when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”,318
1228,"“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every",319
1229,"impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,",319
1230,exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”,319
1231,"“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.",320
1232,"Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off",320
1233,together.,320
1234,"“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may",321
1235,"see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”",321
1236,In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one,322
1237,"of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing",322
1238,"field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing",322
1239,"over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last",322
1240,"within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face",322
1241,glowing with the warmth of exercise.,322
1242,"She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were",323
1243,"assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.",323
1244,That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such,323
1245,"dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and",323
1246,Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt,323
1247,"for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their",323
1248,brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was,323
1249,"good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst",323
1250,nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the,323
1251,brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to,323
1252,the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was,323
1253,thinking only of his breakfast.,323
1254,Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss,324
1255,"Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well",324
1256,enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her,324
1257,"immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving",324
1258,"alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed",324
1259,"for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,",324
1260,"however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,",324
1261,could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the,324
1262,extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended,324
1263,her.,324
1264,"When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth",325
1265,"began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and",325
1266,solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having,325
1267,"examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a",325
1268,"violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;",325
1269,"advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice",325
1270,"was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head",325
1271,"ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were",325
1272,"the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact",325
1273,nothing to do elsewhere.,325
1274,"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very",326
1275,"unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only",326
1276,"wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern",326
1277,at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer,326
1278,of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the,326
1279,"present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was",326
1280,"despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring",326
1281,back a supply of clothes.,326
1282,[Illustration:,327

1289,[Illustration],339
1290,"At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six",340
1291,Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then,340
1292,"poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the",340
1293,"much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very",340
1294,"favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing",340
1295,"this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how",340
1296,"shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked",340
1297,being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their,340
1298,"indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored",340
1299,Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.,340
1300,"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could",341
1301,"regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his",341
1302,attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling,341
1303,herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the,341
1304,others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was,341
1305,"engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.",341
1306,"Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to",341
1307,"eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain",341
1308,"dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.",341
1309,"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley",342
1310,began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were,342
1311,"pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:",342
1312,"she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst",342
1313,"thought the same, and added,--",342
1314,"“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent",343
1315,walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really,343
1316,looked almost wild.”,343
1317,"“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very",344
1318,nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the,344
1319,"country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”",344
1320,"“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep",345
1321,"in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to",345
1322,hide it not doing its office.”,345
1323,"“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was",346
1324,all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well,346
1325,when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite,346
1326,escaped my notice.”,346
1327,"“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am",347
1328,inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such,347
1329,an exhibition.”,347
1330,“Certainly not.”,348
1331,"“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,",349
1332,"above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by",349
1333,"it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,",349
1334,a most country-town indifference to decorum.”,349
1335,"“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said",350
1336,Bingley.,350
1337,"“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,",351
1338,“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine,351
1339,eyes.”,351
1340,"“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A",352
1341,"short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--",352
1342,"“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet",353
1343,"girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such",353
1344,"a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no",353
1345,chance of it.”,353
1346,“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in,354
1347,Meryton?”,354
1348,"“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”",355
1349,"“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.",356
1350,"“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it",357
1351,would not make them one jot less agreeable.”,357
1352,“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any,358
1353,"consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.",358
1354,To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their,359
1355,"hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of",359
1356,their dear friend’s vulgar relations.,359
1357,"With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on",360
1358,"leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.",360
1359,"She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till",360
1360,"late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and",360
1361,when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go,360
1362,"down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole",360
1363,"party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting",360
1364,"them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the",360
1365,"excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay",360
1366,"below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.",360
1367,“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”,361
1368,"“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great",362
1369,"reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”",362
1370,"“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I",363
1371,"am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”",363
1372,"“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and",364
1373,I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”,364
1374,"Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table",365
1375,where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her,365
1376,others; all that his library afforded.,365
1377,“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own,366
1378,"credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more",366
1379,than I ever looked into.”,366
1380,Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those,367
1381,in the room.,367
1382,"“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left",368
1383,so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at,368
1384,"Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”",368
1385,"“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many",369
1386,generations.”,369
1387,“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying,370
1388,books.”,370
1389,“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as,371
1390,these.”,371
1391,“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of,372
1392,"that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be",372
1393,half as delightful as Pemberley.”,372
1394,“I wish it may.”,373
1395,“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that,374
1396,"neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a",374
1397,finer county in England than Derbyshire.”,374
1398,"“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”",375
1399,"“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”",376
1400,"“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get",377
1401,Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”,377
1402,"Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little",378
1403,"attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near",378
1404,"the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest",378
1405,"sister, to observe the game.",378
1406,“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will,379
1407,she be as tall as I am?”,379
1408,"“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or",380
1409,rather taller.”,380
1410,“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me,381
1411,"so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished",381
1412,for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”,381
1413,"“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience",382
1414,to be so very accomplished as they all are.”,382
1415,"“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”",383
1416,"“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and",384
1417,net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am,384
1418,"sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without",384
1419,being informed that she was very accomplished.”,384
1420,"“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has",385
1421,too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no,385
1422,otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very,385
1423,far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I,385
1424,cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my,385
1425,acquaintance that are really accomplished.”,385
1426,"“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.",386
1427,"“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your",387
1428,idea of an accomplished woman.”,387
1429,“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”,388
1430,"“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really",389
1431,esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met,389
1432,"with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,",389
1433,"dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all",389
1434,"this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of",389
1435,"walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word",389
1436,will be but half deserved.”,389
1437,"“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add",390
1438,something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive,390
1439,reading.”,390
1440,“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.,391
1441,I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”,391
1442,“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all,392
1443,this?”,392
1444,"“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and",393
1445,"application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”",393
1446,Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her,394
1447,"implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who",394
1448,"answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with",394
1449,bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all,394
1450,"conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the",394
1451,room.,394
1452,"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is",395
1453,one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other,395
1454,"sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it",395
1455,"succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”",395
1456,"“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,",396
1457,“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend,396
1458,to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is,396
1459,despicable.”,396
1460,Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to,397
1461,continue the subject.,397
1462,"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and",398
1463,that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for,398
1464,"immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could",398
1465,"be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most",398
1466,eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so,398
1467,unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled,398
1468,"that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet",398
1469,were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters,398
1470,"declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,",398
1471,"however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to",398
1472,his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every,398
1473,possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.,398

1477,CHAPTER IX.,408
1478,[Illustration],410
1479,"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the",411
1480,morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the,411
1481,"inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,",411
1482,and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his,411
1483,"sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a",411
1484,"note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her",411
1485,"own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and",411
1486,"its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her",411
1487,"two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.",411
1488,"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been",412
1489,very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was,412
1490,"not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her",412
1491,restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She,412
1492,"would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried",412
1493,"home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think",412
1494,"it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss",412
1495,"Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all",412
1496,attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes,412
1497,that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.,412
1498,"“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be",413
1499,moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass,413
1500,a little longer on your kindness.”,413
1501,"“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am",414
1502,"sure, will not hear of her removal.”",414
1503,"“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,",415
1504,“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she,415
1505,remains with us.”,415
1506,Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.,416
1507,"“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not",417
1508,"know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a",417
1509,"vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is",417
1510,"always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest",417
1511,temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to,417
1512,"_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect",417
1513,over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is,417
1514,"equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I",417
1515,"hope, though you have but a short lease.”",417
1516,"“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I",418
1517,"should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five",418
1518,"minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”",418
1519,"“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.",419
1520,"“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.",420
1521,“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”,421
1522,“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen,422
1523,"through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”",422
1524,"“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,",423
1525,intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”,423
1526,"“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in",424
1527,the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”,424
1528,"“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were",425
1529,a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”,425
1530,“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at,426
1531,least that advantage.”,426
1532,"“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for",427
1533,such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and,427
1534,unvarying society.”,427
1535,"“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be",428
1536,observed in them for ever.”,428
1537,"“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a",429
1538,country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_,429
1539,going on in the country as in town.”,429
1540,"Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,",430
1541,"turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete",430
1542,"victory over him, continued her triumph,--",430
1543,"“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for",431
1544,"my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal",431
1545,"pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”",431
1546,"“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and",432
1547,"when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their",432
1548,"advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”",432
1549,"“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that",433
1550,"gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing",433
1551,at all.”,433
1552,"“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her",434
1553,mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not,434
1554,"such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which",434
1555,you must acknowledge to be true.”,434
1556,"“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with",435
1557,"many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few",435
1558,neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”,435
1559,Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his,436
1560,"countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards",436
1561,"Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of",436
1562,"saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if",436
1563,Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.,436
1564,"“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir",437
1565,"William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so",437
1566,genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_,437
1567,is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very,437
1568,important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”,437
1569,“Did Charlotte dine with you?”,438
1570,"“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For",439
1571,"my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own",439
1572,work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to,439
1573,"judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I",439
1574,assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think,439
1575,Charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”,439
1576,"“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.",440
1577,"“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself",441
1578,"has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast",441
1579,"of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody",441
1580,better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own,441
1581,partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my,441
1582,"brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my",441
1583,sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.,441
1584,"But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he",441
1585,"wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”",441
1586,"“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has",442
1587,"been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first",442
1588,discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”,442
1589,"“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.",443
1590,"“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is",444
1591,"strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I",444
1592,am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”,444
1593,Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth,445
1594,tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to,445
1595,"speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.",445
1596,Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to,445
1597,"Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was",445
1598,"unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be",445
1599,"civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,",445
1600,"indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and",445
1601,"soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of",445
1602,her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to,445
1603,"each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the",445
1604,youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming,445
1605,into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.,445
1606,"Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion",446
1607,"and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose",446
1608,affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high,446
1609,"animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the",446
1610,"attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her",446
1611,"own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was",446
1612,"very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the",446
1613,"ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be",446
1614,the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer,446
1615,to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.,446
1616,"“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when",447
1617,"your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of",447
1618,the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”,447
1619,Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to,448
1620,"wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter",448
1621,"would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she",448
1622,"added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel",448
1623,Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”,448
1624,"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned",449
1625,"instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the",449
1626,"remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,",449
1627,"could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of",449
1628,all Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.,449
1629,[Illustration],453
1630,CHAPTER X.,457
1631,[Illustration],459
1632,The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss,460
1633,"Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who",460
1634,"continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined",460
1635,"their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.",460
1636,"Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching",460
1637,"the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by",460
1638,"messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and",460
1639,Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.,460
1640,"Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in",461
1641,attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual,461
1642,"commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness",461
1643,"of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern",461
1644,"with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was",461
1645,exactly in unison with her opinion of each.,461
1646,“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”,462
1647,He made no answer.,463
1648,“You write uncommonly fast.”,464
1649,“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”,465
1650,“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a,466
1651,"year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”",466
1652,"“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”",467
1653,“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”,468
1654,"“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”",469
1655,“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend,470
1656,pens remarkably well.”,470
1657,“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”,471
1658,“How can you contrive to write so even?”,472
1659,He was silent.,473
1660,"“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,",474
1661,and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful,474
1662,"little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss",474
1663,Grantley’s.”,474
1664,“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At,475
1665,present I have not room to do them justice.”,475
1666,"“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you",476
1667,"always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”",476
1668,"“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me",477
1669,to determine.”,477
1670,"“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with",478
1671,ease cannot write ill.”,478
1672,"“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her",479
1673,"brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much",479
1674,"for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”",479
1675,“My style of writing is very different from yours.”,480
1676,"“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way",481
1677,"imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”",481
1678,“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which,482
1679,means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”,482
1680,"“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”",483
1681,"“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of",484
1682,"humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an",484
1683,indirect boast.”,484
1684,“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”,485
1685,“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in,486
1686,"writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of",486
1687,"thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you",486
1688,think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with,486
1689,"quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any",486
1690,attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.,486
1691,"Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield",486
1692,"you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of",486
1693,"panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very",486
1694,laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business,486
1695,"undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”",486
1696,"“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the",487
1697,"foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I",487
1698,"believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this",487
1699,"moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless",487
1700,precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”,487
1701,“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you,488
1702,would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as,488
1703,"dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were",488
1704,"mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay",488
1705,"till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not",488
1706,"go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”",488
1707,"“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did",489
1708,not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much,489
1709,more than he did himself.”,489
1710,"“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my",490
1711,friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am,490
1712,afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means,490
1713,"intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a",490
1714,"circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I",490
1715,could.”,490
1716,“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention,491
1717,as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”,491
1718,"“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for",492
1719,himself.”,492
1720,"“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,",493
1721,"but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to",493
1722,"stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,",493
1723,"that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and",493
1724,"the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering",493
1725,one argument in favour of its propriety.”,493
1726,“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit,494
1727,with you.”,494
1728,“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of,495
1729,either.”,495
1730,"“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of",496
1731,friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make,496
1732,"one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason",496
1733,one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have,496
1734,"supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the",496
1735,"circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour",496
1736,"thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,",496
1737,where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no,496
1738,"very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying",496
1739,"with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”",496
1740,"“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange",497
1741,with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to,497
1742,"appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting",497
1743,between the parties?”,497
1744,"“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not",498
1745,"forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more",498
1746,"weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure",498
1747,"you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with",498
1748,"myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not",498
1749,"know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in",498
1750,"particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,",498
1751,when he has nothing to do.”,498
1752,Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was,499
1753,"rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly",499
1754,"resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her",499
1755,brother for talking such nonsense.,499
1756,"“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,",500
1757,and want to silence this.”,500
1758,“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss,501
1759,"Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very",501
1760,thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”,501
1761,"“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.",502
1762,Darcy had much better finish his letter.”,502
1763,"Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.",503
1764,"When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth",504
1765,for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to,504
1766,"the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the",504
1767,"way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she",504
1768,seated herself.,504
1769,"Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,",505
1770,"Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books",505
1771,"that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed",505
1772,on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of,505
1773,"admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because",505
1774,"he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,",505
1775,"at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her",505
1776,"more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in",505
1777,any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked,505
1778,him too little to care for his approbation.,505
1779,"After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a",506
1780,"lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near",506
1781,"Elizabeth, said to her,--",506
1782,"“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an",507
1783,opportunity of dancing a reel?”,507
1784,"She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some",508
1785,surprise at her silence.,508
1786,"“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately",509
1787,"determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’",509
1788,that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always,509
1789,"delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of",509
1790,"their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell",509
1791,you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you,509
1792,dare.”,509
1793,“Indeed I do not dare.”,510
1794,"Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his",511
1795,gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her,511
1796,"manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had",511
1797,never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really,511
1798,"believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he",511
1799,should be in some danger.,511
1800,"Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great",512
1801,anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some,512
1802,assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.,512
1803,"She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of",513
1804,"their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.",513
1805,"“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the",514
1806,"next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this",514
1807,"desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;",514
1808,"and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after",514
1809,"the officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to",514
1810,"check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,",514
1811,which your lady possesses.”,514
1812,[Illustration:,515
1813,"     “No, no; stay where you are”",516
1814,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],517
1815,“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”,518
1816,“Oh yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed,519
1817,in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the,519
1818,"judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different",519
1819,"lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it",519
1820,"taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”",519
1821,"“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their",520
1822,"colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be",520
1823,copied.”,520
1824,At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and,521
1825,Elizabeth herself.,521
1826,"“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some",522
1827,"confusion, lest they had been overheard.",522
1828,"“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without",523
1829,telling us that you were coming out.”,523
1830,"Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk",524
1831,"by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,",524
1832,"and immediately said,--",524
1833,“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the,525
1834,avenue.”,525
1835,"But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,",526
1836,"laughingly answered,--",526
1837,"“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to",527
1838,uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a,527
1839,fourth. Good-bye.”,527
1840,"She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of",528
1841,being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered,528
1842,as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.,528

1846,CHAPTER XI.,538
1847,[Illustration],540
1848,"When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and",541
1849,"seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,",541
1850,where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of,541
1851,pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were,541
1852,during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers,541
1853,of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment,541
1854,"with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their",541
1855,acquaintance with spirit.,541
1856,"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;",542
1857,"Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had",542
1858,something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed,542
1859,himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst,542
1860,"also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness",542
1861,and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and,542
1862,"attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she",542
1863,"should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,",542
1864,"to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the",542
1865,"door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.",542
1866,"Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great",542
1867,delight.,542
1868,When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the,543
1869,card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.,543
1870,"Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open",543
1871,"petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the",543
1872,silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.,543
1873,"Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the",543
1874,sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;,543
1875,"and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and",543
1876,"rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss",543
1877,Bennet.,543
1878,Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.,544
1879,"Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was",544
1880,"perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She",544
1881,"could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her",544
1882,"question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be",544
1883,"amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the",544
1884,"second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it",544
1885,"is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no",544
1886,enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a,544
1887,"book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not",544
1888,an excellent library.”,544
1889,"No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and",545
1890,"cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing",545
1891,"her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly",545
1892,"towards him and said,--",545
1893,"“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at",546
1894,"Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult",546
1895,the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not,546
1896,some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a,546
1897,pleasure.”,546
1898,"“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he",547
1899,"chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled",547
1900,"thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send",547
1901,round my cards.”,547
1902,"“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were",548
1903,carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably,548
1904,tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much,548
1905,more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the,548
1906,day.”,548
1907,"“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be",549
1908,near so much like a ball.”,549
1909,"Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about",550
1910,"the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at",550
1911,"whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the",550
1912,"desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,",550
1913,"turning to Elizabeth, said,--",550
1914,"“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a",551
1915,turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so,551
1916,long in one attitude.”,551
1917,"Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley",552
1918,succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked,552
1919,up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as,552
1920,"Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was",552
1921,"directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that",552
1922,he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down,552
1923,"the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would",552
1924,interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his,552
1925,meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.,552
1926,"“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be",553
1927,"severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask",553
1928,nothing about it.”,553
1929,"Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in",554
1930,"anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his",554
1931,two motives.,554
1932,"“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon",555
1933,as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing,555
1934,"the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret",555
1935,"affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures",555
1936,"appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be",555
1937,"completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better",555
1938,as I sit by the fire.”,555
1939,"“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so",556
1940,abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”,556
1941,"“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We",557
1942,can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate,557
1943,"as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”",557
1944,“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not,558
1945,"yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,",558
1946,"no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose",558
1947,"ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.",558
1948,Darcy may hug himself.”,558
1949,“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an,559
1950,"uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would",559
1951,be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a,559
1952,laugh.”,559
1953,"“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The",560
1954,"wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may",560
1955,be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a,560
1956,joke.”,560
1957,"“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am",561
1958,not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies,561
1959,"and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I",561
1960,"laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what",561
1961,you are without.”,561
1962,“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of,562
1963,my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong,562
1964,understanding to ridicule.”,562
1965,“Such as vanity and pride.”,563
1966,"“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real",564
1967,superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”,564
1968,Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.,565
1969,"“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;",566
1970,“and pray what is the result?”,566
1971,“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it,567
1972,himself without disguise.”,567
1973,"“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,",568
1974,"but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch",568
1975,"for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the",568
1976,convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of,568
1977,"others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My",568
1978,feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper,568
1979,would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for,568
1980,ever.”,568
1981,"“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment",569
1982,_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I,569
1983,really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”,569
1984,"“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular",570

1986,“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”,571
1987,"“And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand",572
1988,them.”,572
1989,"“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a",573
1990,"conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my",573
1991,waking Mr. Hurst.”,573
1992,"Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was",574
1993,"opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for",574
1994,it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.,574

1996,CHAPTER XII.,582
1997,[Illustration],584
1998,"In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the",585
1999,"next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for",585
2000,"them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on",585
2001,"her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which",585
2002,"would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive",585
2003,"them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at",585
2004,"least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.",585
2005,Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage,585
2006,"before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley",585
2007,"and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very",585
2008,"well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively",585
2009,"resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the",585
2010,"contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,",585
2011,"she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at",585
2012,length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield,585
2013,"that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.",585
2014,The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was,586
2015,said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on,586
2016,Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was,586
2017,then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike,586
2018,of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.,586
2019,The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so,587
2020,"soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be",587
2021,safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where,587
2022,she felt herself to be right.,587
2023,To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at,588
2024,Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss,588
2025,Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He,588
2026,wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration,588
2027,should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of,588
2028,"influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been",588
2029,"suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight",588
2030,"in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke",588
2031,ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at,588
2032,"one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most",588
2033,"conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.",588
2034,"On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost",589
2035,"all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last",589
2036,"very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,",589
2037,after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to,589
2038,"see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most",589
2039,"tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of",589
2040,the whole party in the liveliest spirits.,589
2041,They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet,590
2042,"wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much",590
2043,"trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their",590
2044,"father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really",590
2045,glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The,590
2046,"evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its",590
2047,"animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and",590
2048,Elizabeth.,590
2049,"They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human",591
2050,nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of,591
2051,threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information,591
2052,"for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said",591
2053,in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers,591
2054,had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it,591
2055,had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.,591

2058,[Illustration],601
2059,"“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at",602
2060,"breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,",602
2061,because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”,602
2062,"“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,",603
2063,unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in; and I hope _my_ dinners,603
2064,are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”,603
2065,“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”,604
2066,Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.,605
2067,"Bingley, I am sure. Why, Jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly",605
2068,"thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.",605
2069,But--good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got,605
2070,"to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill this",605
2071,moment.”,605
2072,"“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I",606
2073,never saw in the whole course of my life.”,606
2074,This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being,607
2075,eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.,607
2076,"After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus",608
2077,"explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a",608
2078,"fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,",608
2079,"and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,",608
2080,"when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he",608
2081,pleases.”,608
2082,"“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.",609
2083,Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing,609
2084,"in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own",609
2085,"children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago",609
2086,to do something or other about it.”,609
2087,Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.,610
2088,They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.,610
2089,Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail,610
2090,bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of,610
2091,"five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.",610
2092,"“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and",611
2093,nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.,611
2094,"But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little",611
2095,softened by his manner of expressing himself.”,611
2096,"“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of",612
2097,"him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false",612
2098,"friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father",612
2099,did before him?”,612
2100,"“Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that",613
2101,"head, as you will hear.”",613
2102,"     /* RIGHT “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, _15th October_. */",614
2103,"“Dear Sir,",615
2104,     “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured,616
2105,"     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since I have had the",616
2106,"     misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the",616
2107,"     breach: but, for some time, I was kept back by my own doubts,",616
2108,     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be,616
2109,     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be,616
2110,"     at variance.”--‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’--“My mind, however, is now",616
2111,"     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at Easter,",616
2112,     I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of,616
2113,"     the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis",616
2114,"     de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the",616
2115,"     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest",616
2116,     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her,616
2117,"     Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies",616
2118,"     which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,",616
2119,"     moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing",616
2120,     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on,616
2121,     these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of,616
2122,"     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my",616
2123,     being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly,616
2124,"     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered",616
2125,     olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the,616
2126,"     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to",616
2127,"     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make",616
2128,     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. If you should,616
2129,"     have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself",616
2130,"     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday,",616
2131,"     November 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your",616
2132,"     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do",616
2133,"     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting",616
2134,"     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other",616
2135,"     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir,",616
2136,"     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your",616
2137,"     well-wisher and friend,",616
2138,“WILLIAM COLLINS.”,617
2139,"“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”",618
2140,"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most",618
2141,"conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, I doubt not, will",618
2142,"prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so",618
2143,indulgent as to let him come to us again.”,618
2144,"“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if",619
2145,"he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to",619
2146,discourage him.”,619
2147,"“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean",620
2148,"to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his",620
2149,credit.”,620
2150,Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady,621
2151,"Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying",621
2152,his parishioners whenever it were required.,621
2153,"“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There",622
2154,is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by,622
2155,apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would,622
2156,"help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”",622
2157,"“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the",623
2158,reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his,623
2159,letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”,623
2160,"“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem",624
2161,"defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I",624
2162,think it is well expressed.”,624
2163,To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any,625
2164,degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should,625
2165,"come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had",625
2166,received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for,625
2167,"their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,",625
2168,and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which,625
2169,astonished her husband and daughters.,625
2170,"Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great",626
2171,politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the,626
2172,"ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need",626
2173,"of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,",626
2174,heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and,626
2175,"stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated",626
2176,before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of,626
2177,"daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this",626
2178,"instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not",626
2179,doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This,626
2180,gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.,626
2181,"Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--",626
2182,"“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may",627
2183,prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so,627
2184,oddly.”,627
2185,"“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”",628
2186,"“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you",629
2187,"must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,",629
2188,"I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates",629
2189,will go when once they come to be entailed.”,629
2190,"“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and",630
2191,"could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing",630
2192,forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come,630
2193,"prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,",630
2194,when we are better acquainted----”,630
2195,He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each,631
2196,other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The,631
2197,"hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;",631
2198,and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s,631
2199,"heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his",631
2200,"own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;",631
2201,and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its,631
2202,"cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured",631
2203,"him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good",631
2204,"cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged",631
2205,pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared,631
2206,herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a,631
2207,quarter of an hour.,631
2208,[Illustration],635
2209,CHAPTER XIV,639
2210,[Illustration],641
2211,"During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants",642
2212,"were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his",642
2213,"guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to",642
2214,"shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady",642
2215,"Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his",642
2216,"comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen",642
2217,better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him,642
2218,to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect,642
2219,he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a,642
2220,"person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself",642
2221,experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to,642
2222,approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of,642
2223,"preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,",642
2224,"and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of",642
2225,quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many,642
2226,"people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.",642
2227,She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she,642
2228,made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the,642
2229,"neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or",642
2230,two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to,642
2231,"marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had",642
2232,"once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly",642
2233,"approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed",642
2234,"to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.",642
2235,"“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I",643
2236,dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies,643
2237,"in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”",643
2238,“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane,644
2239,"from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”",644
2240,"“I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”",645
2241,"“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very",646
2242,extensive property.”,646
2243,"“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than",647
2244,many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”,647
2245,"“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says",648
2246,"that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the",648
2247,handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks,648
2248,the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly,648
2249,"constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many",648
2250,"accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am",648
2251,"informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still",648
2252,"resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends",648
2253,to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”,648
2254,“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at,649
2255,court.”,649
2256,“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;,650
2257,"and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived",650
2258,the British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased,650
2259,with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to,650
2260,offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to,650
2261,"ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her",650
2262,charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most,650
2263,"elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by",650
2264,"her. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and",650
2265,it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to,650
2266,pay.”,650
2267,"“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you",651
2268,that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask,651
2269,whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the,651
2270,"moment, or are the result of previous study?”",651
2271,“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I,652
2272,sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant,652
2273,"compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to",652
2274,give them as unstudied an air as possible.”,652
2275,Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd,653
2276,"as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,",653
2277,"maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,",653
2278,"and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner",653
2279,in his pleasure.,653
2280,"By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad",654
2281,"to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,",654
2282,glad to invite him,654
2283,[Illustration:,655
2284,“Protested,656
2285,that he never read novels”      H.T Feb 94,656
2286,],656
2287,"to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book",657
2288,was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be,657
2289,"from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,",657
2290,"protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia",657
2291,"exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he",657
2292,chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and,657
2293,"before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she",657
2294,"interrupted him with,--",657
2295,"“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away",658
2296,"Richard? and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me",658
2297,so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more,658
2298,"about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”",658
2299,Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.,659
2300,"Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--",659
2301,“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books,660
2302,"of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes",660
2303,"me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to",660
2304,them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”,660
2305,"Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at",661
2306,"backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted",661
2307,very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.,661
2308,Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s,661
2309,"interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would",661
2310,"resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his",661
2311,"young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any",661
2312,"affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared",661
2313,for backgammon.,661
2314,[Illustration],665
2315,CHAPTER XV.,669
2316,[Illustration],671
2317,"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had",672
2318,been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of,672
2319,his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and,672
2320,"miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he",672
2321,had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful,672
2322,acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had,672
2323,given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good,672
2324,"deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in",672
2325,"retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected",672
2326,prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de,672
2327,Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he,672
2328,"felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,",672
2329,"mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a",672
2330,"clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of",672
2331,"pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.",672
2332,"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to",673
2333,marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had,673
2334,"a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found",673
2335,them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.,673
2336,This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s,673
2337,"estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and",673
2338,"suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own",673
2339,part.,673
2340,His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face,674
2341,"confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what",674
2342,was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled,674
2343,"choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter",674
2344,"of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a",674
2345,"conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally",674
2346,"to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at",674
2347,"Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general",674
2348,"encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to",674
2349,"her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could",674
2350,not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her,674
2351,_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to,674
2352,"hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”",674
2353,Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon,675
2354,"done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally",675
2355,"next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.",675
2356,"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have",676
2357,two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of,676
2358,"the day before, was now high in her good graces.",676
2359,Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister,677
2360,"except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,",677
2361,"at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,",677
2362,and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed,677
2363,"him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with",677
2364,"one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.",677
2365,"Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such",677
2366,doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been,677
2367,"always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told",677
2368,"Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the",677
2369,"house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,",677
2370,was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their,677
2371,"walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker",677
2372,"than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and",677
2373,go.,677
2374,"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his",678
2375,"cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of",678
2376,the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes,678
2377,"were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and",678
2378,"nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in",678
2379,"a shop window, could recall them.",678
2380,"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom",679
2381,"they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking",679
2382,with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very,679
2383,"Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and",679
2384,"he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all",679
2385,"wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible",679
2386,"to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting",679
2387,"something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the",679
2388,"pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same",679
2389,"spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to",679
2390,"introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day",679
2391,"before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in",679
2392,their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted,679
2393,only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was,679
2394,"greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine",679
2395,"countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction",679
2396,was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a,679
2397,readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the,679
2398,"whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,",679
2399,"when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were",679
2400,seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group,679
2401,"the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual",679
2402,"civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the",679
2403,"principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on",679
2404,"purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and",679
2405,"was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they",679
2406,were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth,679
2407,"happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,",679
2408,"was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,",679
2409,"one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,",679
2410,touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.,679
2411,What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was,679
2412,impossible not to long to know.,679
2413,"In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what",680
2414,"passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.",680
2415,Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of,681
2416,"Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s",681
2417,"pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.",681
2418,"Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the",681
2419,invitation.,681
2420,"Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from",682
2421,"their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly",682
2422,"expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own",682
2423,"carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if",682
2424,"she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had",682
2425,"told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,",682
2426,"because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed",682
2427,towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with,682
2428,"her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,",682
2429,"apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with",682
2430,"her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be",682
2431,justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to,682
2432,her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good,682
2433,breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to,682
2434,"by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she",682
2435,"could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had",682
2436,"brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s",682
2437,"commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,",682
2438,"she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham",682
2439,"appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;",682
2440,but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the,682
2441,"officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,",682
2442,disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the,682
2443,"next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.",682
2444,"Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn",682
2445,would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips,682
2446,protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery,682
2447,"tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such",682
2448,"delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.",682
2449,"Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,",682
2450,"with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.",682
2451,"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass",683
2452,between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or,683
2453,"both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such",683
2454,behaviour than her sister.,683
2455,Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.,684
2456,"Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady",684
2457,"Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for",684
2458,"she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even",684
2459,"pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although",684
2460,"utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be",684
2461,"attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so",684
2462,much attention in the whole course of his life.,684
2463,[Illustration],688
2464,CHAPTER XVI.,692
2465,[Illustration],694
2466,As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their,695
2467,"aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for",695
2468,"a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach",695
2469,conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the,695
2470,"girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,",695
2471,"that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in",695
2472,the house.,695
2473,"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.",696
2474,"Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much",696
2475,"struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he",696
2476,might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour,696
2477,at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much,696
2478,gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings,696
2479,"was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the",696
2480,"description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found",696
2481,"that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all",696
2482,"the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison",696
2483,with the housekeeper’s room.,696
2484,"In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,",697
2485,"with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the",697
2486,"improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the",697
2487,gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive,697
2488,"listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she",697
2489,"heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as",697
2490,"soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,",697
2491,"and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine",697
2492,"their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the",697
2493,"interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.",697
2494,"The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,",697
2495,"Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking",697
2496,"of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The",697
2497,"officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,",697
2498,gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but,697
2499,"Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and",697
2500,"walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,",697
2501,"breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.",697
2502,[Illustration:,698
2503,“The officers of the ----shire”,699
2504,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],700
2505,Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was,701
2506,"turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated",701
2507,himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into,701
2508,"conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the",701
2509,"probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,",701
2510,"dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the",701
2511,skill of the speaker.,701
2512,With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the,702
2513,"officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young",702
2514,ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind,702
2515,"listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly",702
2516,supplied with coffee and muffin.,702
2517,"When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,",703
2518,"in return, by sitting down to whist.",703
2519,"“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to",704
2520,improve myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very,704
2521,"thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.",704
2522,"Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he",705
2523,received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there,705
2524,"seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most",705
2525,"determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,",705
2526,"she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets",705
2527,"and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.",705
2528,"Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore",705
2529,"at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,",705
2530,"though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,",705
2531,the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even,705
2532,"mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly",705
2533,relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far,705
2534,"Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in",705
2535,a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.,705
2536,"“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject",706
2537,"drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I",706
2538,understand.”,706
2539,"“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten",707
2540,thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of,707
2541,giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been,707
2542,"connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”",707
2543,Elizabeth could not but look surprised.,708
2544,"“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after",709
2545,"seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting",709
2546,yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”,709
2547,"“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent",710
2548,"four days in the same house with him, and I think him very",710
2549,disagreeable.”,710
2550,"“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being",711
2551,agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him,711
2552,too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to,711
2553,be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general,711
2554,"astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly",711
2555,anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”,711
2556,“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the,712
2557,"neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in",712
2558,Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find,712
2559,him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”,712
2560,"“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short",713
2561,"interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond",713
2562,their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The,713
2563,"world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his",713
2564,"high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”",713
2565,"“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an",714
2566,ill-tempered man.”,714
2567,Wickham only shook his head.,715
2568,"“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is",716
2569,likely to be in this country much longer.”,716
2570,“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I,717
2571,was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will,717
2572,not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”,717
2573,“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_,718
2574,"wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,",718
2575,"and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for",718
2576,avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of,718
2577,"very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.",718
2578,"His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men",718
2579,"that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be",718
2580,in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a,718
2581,thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been,718
2582,scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and,718
2583,"everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the",718
2584,memory of his father.”,718
2585,"Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with",719
2586,all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.,719
2587,"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the",720
2588,"neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he",720
2589,"had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but",720
2590,very intelligible gallantry.,720
2591,"“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,",721
2592,“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a,721
2593,"most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me",721
2594,"further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great",721
2595,attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.,721
2596,"Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and",721
2597,my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.,721
2598,"A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have",721
2599,now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I,721
2600,was brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in,721
2601,"possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we",721
2602,were speaking of just now.”,721
2603,“Indeed!”,722
2604,“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best,723
2605,"living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.",723
2606,"I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,",723
2607,"and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given",723
2608,elsewhere.”,723
2609,“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his,724
2610,will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”,724
2611,“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to,725
2612,give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the,725
2613,"intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely",725
2614,"conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim",725
2615,"to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.",725
2616,"Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I",725
2617,"was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no",725
2618,"less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done",725
2619,"anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I",725
2620,"may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too",725
2621,"freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very",725
2622,"different sort of men, and that he hates me.”",725
2623,“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”,726
2624,“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I,727
2625,"can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”",727
2626,"Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than",728
2627,ever as he expressed them.,728
2628,"“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can",729
2629,have induced him to behave so cruelly?”,729
2630,"“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but",730
2631,attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me,730
2632,"less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon",730
2633,"attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had",730
2634,not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort,730
2635,of preference which was often given me.”,730
2636,“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked,731
2637,"him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be",731
2638,"despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of",731
2639,"descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as",731
2640,this!”,731
2641,"After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_",732
2642,"remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of",732
2643,"his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition",732
2644,must be dreadful.”,732
2645,"“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can",733
2646,hardly be just to him.”,733
2647,"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To",734
2648,"treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his",734
2649,"father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very",734
2650,countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself,734
2651,"with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from",734
2652,"childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest",734
2653,manner.”,734
2654,"“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest",735
2655,"part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,",735
2656,"sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_",735
2657,"father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,",735
2658,appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use,735
2659,"to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the",735
2660,"Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most",735
2661,"intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to",735
2662,be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;,735
2663,"and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a",735
2664,"voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it",735
2665,to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”,735
2666,“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very,736
2667,pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better,736
2668,"motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for",736
2669,dishonesty I must call it.”,736
2670,"“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be",737
2671,traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has,737
2672,connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none,737
2673,of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger,737
2674,impulses even than pride.”,737
2675,“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”,738
2676,“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money,739
2677,"freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the",739
2678,"poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his",739
2679,"father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to",739
2680,"degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the",739
2681,"Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,",739
2682,"which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and",739
2683,careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up,739
2684,as the most attentive and best of brothers.”,739
2685,“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”,740
2686,He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to,741
2687,"speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very",741
2688,"proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond",741
2689,of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is,741
2690,"nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,",741
2691,"and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her",741
2692,"home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her",741
2693,education.”,741
2694,"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not",742
2695,"help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--",742
2696,"“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,",743
2697,"who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,",743
2698,be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you,743
2699,know Mr. Bingley?”,743
2700,“Not at all.”,744
2701,"“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.",745
2702,Darcy is.”,745
2703,“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not,746
2704,want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth,746
2705,"his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a",746
2706,very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride,746
2707,"never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,",746
2708,"sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing",746
2709,something for fortune and figure.”,746
2710,"The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round",747
2711,"the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin",747
2712,Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were,747
2713,made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;,747
2714,"but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured",747
2715,"her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;",747
2716,"that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not",747
2717,make herself uneasy.,747
2718,"“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a",748
2719,"card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I",748
2720,am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There,748
2721,"are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady",748
2722,"Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding",748
2723,little matters.”,748
2724,Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for,749
2725,"a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations",749
2726,were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.,749
2727,"“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a",750
2728,living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her,750
2729,"notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”",750
2730,“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy,751
2731,were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”,751
2732,"“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s",752
2733,connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before,752
2734,yesterday.”,752
2735,"“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is",753
2736,believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”,753
2737,"This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss",754
2738,"Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her",754
2739,"affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already",754
2740,self-destined to another.,754
2741,"“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her",755
2742,"daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her",755
2743,"Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of",755
2744,"her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”",755
2745,"“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have",756
2746,not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked,756
2747,"her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the",756
2748,reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe,756
2749,"she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from",756
2750,"her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who",756
2751,chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of,756
2752,the first class.”,756
2753,"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and",757
2754,they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put,757
2755,"an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.",757
2756,Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of,757
2757,"Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to",757
2758,"everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done",757
2759,gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could,757
2760,"think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all",757
2761,the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as,757
2762,"they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia",757
2763,"talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the",757
2764,"fish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and",757
2765,"Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses",757
2766,"at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing",757
2767,"that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage",757
2768,before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.,757
2769,[Illustration:,761
2770,     “delighted to see their dear friend again”,762
2771,],762
2772,CHAPTER XVII.,766
2773,[Illustration],768
2774,"Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.",769
2775,Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she,769
2776,knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.,769
2777,Bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the,769
2778,veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The,769
2779,possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to,769
2780,interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be,769
2781,"done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and",769
2782,throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be,769
2783,otherwise explained.,769
2784,"“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or",770
2785,"other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps",770
2786,"misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to",770
2787,"conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,",770
2788,without actual blame on either side.”,770
2789,"“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in",771
2790,behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the,771
2791,"business? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of",771
2792,somebody.”,771
2793,"“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my",772
2794,"opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light",772
2795,"it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a",772
2796,"manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is",772
2797,"impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his",772
2798,"character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so",772
2799,excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”,772
2800,“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that,773
2801,Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last,773
2802,"night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not",773
2803,"so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”",773
2804,"“It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to",774
2805,think.”,774
2806,“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”,775
2807,"But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.",776
2808,"Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when",776
2809,the affair became public.,776
2810,"The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this",777
2811,"conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom",777
2812,they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their,777
2813,"personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was",777
2814,fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see,777
2815,"their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and",777
2816,repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their,777
2817,separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;,777
2818,"avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,",777
2819,"and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from",777
2820,"their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and",777
2821,hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.,777
2822,The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every,778
2823,female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in,778
2824,"compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by",778
2825,"receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a",778
2826,ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the,778
2827,"society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and",778
2828,Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.,778
2829,"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look",778
2830,and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended,778
2831,"less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they",778
2832,"each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,",778
2833,"he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball",778
2834,"was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she",778
2835,had no disinclination for it.,778
2836,"“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I",779
2837,think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.,779
2838,Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who,779
2839,consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for,779
2840,everybody.”,779
2841,"Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did",780
2842,"not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking",780
2843,"him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he",780
2844,"did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s",780
2845,amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no,780
2846,"scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,",780
2847,"either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to",780
2848,dance.,780
2849,"“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of",781
2850,"this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can",781
2851,have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing,781
2852,"myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair",781
2853,cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of,781
2854,"soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a",781
2855,preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right,781
2856,"cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”",781
2857,Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being,782
2858,engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins,782
2859,instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help,782
2860,"for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce",782
2861,"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as",782
2862,good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his,782
2863,"gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first",782
2864,"struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of",782
2865,"being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a",782
2866,"quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.",782
2867,"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing",782
2868,"civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a",782
2869,compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than,782
2870,"gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before",782
2871,her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage,782
2872,"was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose",782
2873,"to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the",782
2874,"consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,",782
2875,"till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.",782
2876,"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the",783
2877,younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;,783
2878,"for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was",783
2879,such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No,783
2880,"aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses",783
2881,for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some,783
2882,trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement,783
2883,of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on,783
2884,"Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday",783
2885,endurable to Kitty and Lydia.,783
2886,[Illustration],787
2887,CHAPTER XVIII.,791
2888,[Illustration],793
2889,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in",794
2890,"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a",794
2891,doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of,794
2892,meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that,794
2893,might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than,794
2894,"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all",794
2895,"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than",794
2896,might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the,794
2897,"dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s",794
2898,"pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this",794
2899,"was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was",794
2900,"pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and",794
2901,who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business,794
2902,"the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant",794
2903,"smile,--",794
2904,"“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if",795
2905,he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”,795
2906,"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by",796
2907,"Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for",796
2908,"Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling",796
2909,of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate,796
2910,"disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to",796
2911,the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.,796
2912,"Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She",796
2913,"was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away",796
2914,with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in,796
2915,"speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.",796
2916,But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect,797
2917,"of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her",797
2918,"spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she",797
2919,"had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary",797
2920,"transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her",797
2921,"particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of",797
2922,"distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and",797
2923,"solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong",797
2924,"without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a",797
2925,disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her,797
2926,release from him was ecstasy.,797
2927,"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of",798
2928,"Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances",798
2929,"were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with",798
2930,"her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took",798
2931,"her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without",798
2932,"knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again",798
2933,"immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of",798
2934,mind: Charlotte tried to console her.,798
2935,“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”,799
2936,“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find,800
2937,a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an,800
2938,evil.”,800
2939,"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her",801
2940,"hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a",801
2941,"simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant",801
2942,in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no,801
2943,"answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which",801
2944,"she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and",801
2945,reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.,801
2946,They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to,801
2947,"imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at",801
2948,"first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it",801
2949,"would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,",801
2950,"she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again",801
2951,"silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,",801
2952,with--,801
2953,"“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the",802
2954,"dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the",802
2955,"room, or the number of couples.”",802
2956,"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be",803
2957,said.,803
2958,"“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I",804
2959,may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but,804
2960,_now_ we may be silent.”,804
2961,"“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”",805
2962,"“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be",806
2963,"entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of",806
2964,"_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the",806
2965,trouble of saying as little as possible.”,806
2966,"“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you",807
2967,imagine that you are gratifying mine?”,807
2968,"“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great",808
2969,"similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,",808
2970,"taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say",808
2971,"something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to",808
2972,posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”,808
2973,"“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”",809
2974,"said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_",809
2975,"think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”",809
2976,“I must not decide on my own performance.”,810
2977,He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down,811
2978,"the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often",811
2979,"walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist",811
2980,"the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just",811
2981,been forming a new acquaintance.”,811
2982,The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his,812
2983,"features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself",812
2984,"for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a",812
2985,"constrained manner said,--",812
2986,“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his,813
2987,"_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,",813
2988,is less certain.”,813
2989,"“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,",814
2990,"with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all",814
2991,his life.”,814
2992,"Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At",815
2993,"that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass",815
2994,"through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.",815
2995,"Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on",815
2996,his dancing and his partner.,815
2997,"“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very",816
2998,superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the,816
2999,"first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not",816
3000,"disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,",816
3001,"especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing",816
3002,"at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will",816
3003,"then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.",816
3004,You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of,816
3005,"that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”",816
3006,[Illustration:,817
3007,“Such very superior dancing is not,818
3008,often seen.”,818
3009,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],819
3010,The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir,820
3011,"William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his",820
3012,"eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and",820
3013,"Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,",820
3014,"he turned to his partner, and said,--",820
3015,“Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking,821
3016,of.”,821
3017,“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have,822
3018,interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for,822
3019,"themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,",822
3020,and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”,822
3021,"“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.",823
3022,"“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same",824
3023,feelings.”,824
3024,"“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be",825
3025,no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”,825
3026,“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of,826
3027,something else.”,826
3028,"“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,",827
3029,with a look of doubt.,827
3030,"“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her",828
3031,"thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared",828
3032,"by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,",828
3033,"that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was",828
3034,"unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being",828
3035,created_?”,828
3036,"“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.",829
3037,“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”,830
3038,“I hope not.”,831
3039,"“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,",832
3040,to be secure of judging properly at first.”,832
3041,“May I ask to what these questions tend?”,833
3042,"“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring",834
3043,to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”,834
3044,“And what is your success?”,835
3045,She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different,836
3046,accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”,836
3047,"“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary",837
3048,"greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were",837
3049,"not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to",837
3050,fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”,837
3051,"“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another",838
3052,opportunity.”,838
3053,"“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.",839
3054,"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in",839
3055,"silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for",839
3056,"in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,",839
3057,"which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against",839
3058,another.,839
3059,"They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,",840
3060,"with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--",840
3061,"“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?",841
3062,"Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand",841
3063,"questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his",841
3064,"other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.",841
3065,"Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give",841
3066,"implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using",841
3067,"him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always",841
3068,"remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a",841
3069,"most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very",841
3070,well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear,841
3071,to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he,841
3072,"could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he",841
3073,was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.,841
3074,"His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and",841
3075,"I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this",841
3076,"discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his",841
3077,"descent, one could not expect much better.”",841
3078,"“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”",842
3079,"said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing",842
3080,"worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can",842
3081,"assure you, he informed me himself.”",842
3082,"“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.",843
3083,“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”,843
3084,“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if,844
3085,you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see,844
3086,nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.,844
3087,"Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make",844
3088,inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of,844
3089,"such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently",844
3090,marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.,844
3091,"Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude",844
3092,"for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave",844
3093,way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.,844
3094,"“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her",845
3095,"sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have",845
3096,"been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case",845
3097,you may be sure of my pardon.”,845
3098,"“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing",846
3099,satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his,846
3100,"history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have",846
3101,"principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,",846
3102,"the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that",846
3103,Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has,846
3104,"received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his",846
3105,"sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am",846
3106,"afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s",846
3107,regard.”,846
3108,“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”,847
3109,“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”,848
3110,“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am,849
3111,perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”,849
3112,"“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard",850
3113,"them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to",850
3114,him _conditionally_ only.”,850
3115,"“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,",851
3116,“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.,851
3117,"Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but",851
3118,"since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt",851
3119,"the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of",851
3120,both gentlemen as I did before.”,851
3121,"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on",852
3122,which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with,852
3123,delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of,852
3124,"Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence",852
3125,"in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew",852
3126,to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last,852
3127,"partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,",852
3128,"and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate",852
3129,as to make a most important discovery.,852
3130,"“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now",853
3131,in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the,853
3132,gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of,853
3133,"this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,",853
3134,Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would,853
3135,have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de,853
3136,Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made,853
3137,"in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,",853
3138,and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total,853
3139,ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”,853
3140,“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”,854
3141,“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.,855
3142,I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to,855
3143,assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”,855
3144,Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him,856
3145,that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as,856
3146,"an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it",856
3147,was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either,856
3148,"side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in",856
3149,"consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with",856
3150,"the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased",856
3151,"speaking, replied thus,--",856
3152,"“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your",857
3153,excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your,857
3154,"understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference",857
3155,between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those,857
3156,"which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider",857
3157,the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank,857
3158,in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the,857
3159,"same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the",857
3160,"dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform",857
3161,what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by,857
3162,"your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,",857
3163,though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education,857
3164,and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like,857
3165,"yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose",857
3166,"reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at",857
3167,being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with,857
3168,"a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if",857
3169,"hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”",857
3170,"“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him",857
3171,expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with,857
3172,"unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,",857
3173,"replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not",857
3174,"discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed",857
3175,abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the,857
3176,"end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.",857
3177,Collins then returned to Elizabeth.,857
3178,"“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my",858
3179,reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered,858
3180,"me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,",858
3181,that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be,858
3182,certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very,858
3183,"handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”",858
3184,"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned",859
3185,her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the,859
3186,train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made,859
3187,her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that,859
3188,"very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could",859
3189,"bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring",859
3190,even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly,859
3191,"saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,",859
3192,"lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,",859
3193,she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within,859
3194,one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was,859
3195,"talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing",859
3196,else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.,859
3197,"Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable",859
3198,of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such,859
3199,"a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,",859
3200,were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a,859
3201,"comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be",859
3202,certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It,859
3203,"was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as",859
3204,Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;,859
3205,"and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to",859
3206,"consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might",859
3207,not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary,859
3208,"to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such",859
3209,occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.,859
3210,Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She,859
3211,concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally,859
3212,"fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no",859
3213,chance of it.,859
3214,In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s,860
3215,"words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible",860
3216,whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the,860
3217,"chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her",860
3218,mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.,860
3219,"“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am",861
3220,sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say,861
3221,nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”,861
3222,"“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you",862
3223,to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by,862
3224,so doing.”,862
3225,"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would",863
3226,talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and,863
3227,blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently,863
3228,"glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what",863
3229,"she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was",863
3230,convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression,863
3231,of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and,863
3232,steady gravity.,863
3233,"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who",864
3234,had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no,864
3235,"likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.",864
3236,Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of,864
3237,"tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she",864
3238,"had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,",864
3239,preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent,864
3240,entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of,864
3241,"complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an",864
3242,"opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.",864
3243,"Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and",864
3244,she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience,864
3245,"which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving",864
3246,amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be,864
3247,"prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute",864
3248,began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;,864
3249,"her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.",864
3250,She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly,864
3251,"talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making",864
3252,"signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,",864
3253,impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his,864
3254,"interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,",864
3255,"and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--",864
3256,"“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.",865
3257,Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”,865
3258,"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and",866
3259,"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid",866
3260,her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.,866
3261,"“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I",867
3262,"should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an",867
3263,"air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly",867
3264,"compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,",867
3265,to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to,867
3266,"music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The",867
3267,"rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such",867
3268,an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not,867
3269,offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time,867
3270,"that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care",867
3271,"and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making",867
3272,as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance,867
3273,that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards,867
3274,"everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I",867
3275,cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who,867
3276,should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody,867
3277,"connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded",867
3278,"his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the",867
3279,room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.,867
3280,"Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for",867
3281,"having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady",867
3282,"Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.",867
3283,"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to",868
3284,"expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would",868
3285,"have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or",868
3286,finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister,868
3287,"that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his",868
3288,feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he,868
3289,"must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should",868
3290,have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and,868
3291,"she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or",868
3292,"the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.",868
3293,The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by,869
3294,"Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he",869
3295,"could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her",869
3296,power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with,869
3297,"somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the",869
3298,"room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent",869
3299,"to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend",869
3300,himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining,869
3301,close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a,869
3302,"project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who",869
3303,"often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation",869
3304,to herself.,869
3305,She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:,870
3306,"though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite",870
3307,"disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the",870
3308,"probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in",870
3309,it.,870
3310,The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a,871
3311,manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an,871
3312,"hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how",871
3313,heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her,871
3314,"sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and",871
3315,were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed,871
3316,"every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a",871
3317,"languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long",871
3318,"speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his",871
3319,"sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and",871
3320,politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said,871
3321,"nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.",871
3322,Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the,871
3323,"rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a",871
3324,silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too,871
3325,"much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,",871
3326,how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.,871
3327,"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly",872
3328,civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and,872
3329,"addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy",872
3330,"he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,",872
3331,without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful,872
3332,pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of,872
3333,"waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to",872
3334,go the next day for a short time.,872
3335,Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the,873
3336,"delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of",873
3337,"settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly",873
3338,see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four,873
3339,months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought,873
3340,"with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.",873
3341,Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the,873
3342,"man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each",873
3343,was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.,873
3344,[Illustration:,877
3345,     “to assure you in the most animated language”,878
3346,],878
3347,CHAPTER XIX.,882
3348,[Illustration],884
3349,The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his,885
3350,"declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as",885
3351,"his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having",885
3352,no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the,885
3353,"moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the",885
3354,observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding,885
3355,"Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon",885
3356,"after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--",885
3357,"“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,",886
3358,when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the,886
3359,course of this morning?”,886
3360,"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.",887
3361,"Bennet instantly answered,--",887
3362,"“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure",888
3363,"she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And",888
3364,"gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth",888
3365,"called out,--",888
3366,"“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse",889
3367,me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am,889
3368,going away myself.”,889
3369,"“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And",890
3370,"upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about",890
3371,"to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing",890
3372,Mr. Collins.”,890
3373,Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s,891
3374,consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it,891
3375,"over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried",891
3376,"to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided",891
3377,"between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as",891
3378,"soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--",891
3379,"“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from",892
3380,"doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You",892
3381,would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little,892
3382,unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected,892
3383,mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport,892
3384,"of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to",892
3385,dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as,892
3386,soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my,892
3387,future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this,892
3388,"subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for",892
3389,"marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design",892
3390,"of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”",892
3391,"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away",893
3392,"with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not",893
3393,"use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and",893
3394,"he continued,--",893
3395,"“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for",894
3396,every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example,894
3397,"of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add",894
3398,"very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to",894
3399,"have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and",894
3400,recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling,894
3401,patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked,894
3402,too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I,894
3403,"left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was",894
3404,"arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you",894
3405,"must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a",894
3406,"gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,",894
3407,"useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small",894
3408,income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as,894
3409,"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the",894
3410,"way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and",894
3411,kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the,894
3412,advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond,894
3413,"anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be",894
3414,"acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect",894
3415,which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general,894
3416,intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views,894
3417,"were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I",894
3418,"assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that",894
3419,"being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured",894
3420,"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy",894
3421,"myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that",894
3422,the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy,894
3423,"event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be",894
3424,"for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I",894
3425,flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing,894
3426,remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the,894
3427,"violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and",894
3428,"shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well",894
3429,aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds,894
3430,"in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s",894
3431,"decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,",894
3432,"therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that",894
3433,no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”,894
3434,It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.,895
3435,"“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no",896
3436,answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for,896
3437,the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of,896
3438,"your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline",896
3439,them.”,896
3440,"“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the",897
3441,"hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the",897
3442,"man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their",897
3443,favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a,897
3444,"third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have",897
3445,"just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”",897
3446,"“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an",898
3447,extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not,898
3448,one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so,898
3449,daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second,898
3450,time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_,898
3451,"happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who",898
3452,"would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I",898
3453,am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the,898
3454,situation.”,898
3455,"“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,",899
3456,very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all,899
3457,disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of,899
3458,"seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,",899
3459,"economy, and other amiable qualifications.”",899
3460,"“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must",900
3461,"give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of",900
3462,"believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by",900
3463,"refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.",900
3464,"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your",900
3465,"feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn",900
3466,"estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be",900
3467,"considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus",900
3468,"spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus",900
3469,"addressed her,--",900
3470,"“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I",901
3471,shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given,901
3472,"me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I",901
3473,know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the,901
3474,"first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to",901
3475,encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the,901
3476,female character.”,901
3477,"“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me",902
3478,exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form,902
3479,"of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as",902
3480,may convince you of its being one.”,902
3481,"“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your",903
3482,refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for,903
3483,believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand,903
3484,"is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer",903
3485,"would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my",903
3486,"connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your",903
3487,"own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into",903
3488,"further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is",903
3489,by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.,903
3490,"Your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo",903
3491,"the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,",903
3492,"therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I",903
3493,shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by,903
3494,"suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”",903
3495,"“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind",904
3496,of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would,904
3497,rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you,904
3498,"again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but",904
3499,to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect,904
3500,forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant,904
3501,"female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the",904
3502,truth from her heart.”,904
3503,"“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward",905
3504,"gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express",905
3505,"authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of",905
3506,being acceptable.”,905
3507,To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no,906
3508,"reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he",906
3509,persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering,906
3510,"encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered",906
3511,"in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could",906
3512,not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.,906
3513,[Illustration],910
3514,CHAPTER XX.,914
3515,[Illustration],916
3516,Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his,917
3517,"successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule",917
3518,"to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the",917
3519,"door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she",917
3520,"entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in",917
3521,warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins,917
3522,"received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then",917
3523,"proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result",917
3524,"of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the",917
3525,refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow,917
3526,from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.,917
3527,"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been",918
3528,glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage,918
3529,"him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,",918
3530,and could not help saying so.,918
3531,"“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be",919
3532,brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is,919
3533,"a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but",919
3534,I will _make_ her know it.”,919
3535,"“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she",920
3536,"is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would",920
3537,"altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who",920
3538,"naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she",920
3539,"actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to",920
3540,"force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of",920
3541,"temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”",920
3542,"“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is",921
3543,only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as,921
3544,"good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and",921
3545,"we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”",921
3546,"She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her",922
3547,"husband, called out, as she entered the library,--",922
3548,"“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.",923
3549,"You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will",923
3550,not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and,923
3551,not have _her_.”,923
3552,"Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them",924
3553,"on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by",924
3554,her communication.,924
3555,"“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had",925
3556,finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”,925
3557,"“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,",926
3558,and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”,926
3559,“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”,927
3560,“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her,928
3561,marrying him.”,928
3562,“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”,929
3563,"Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the",930
3564,library.,930
3565,"“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for",931
3566,you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made,931
3567,you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”,931
3568,Elizabeth replied that it was.,932
3569,“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”,933
3570,"“I have, sir.”",934
3571,“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your,935
3572,"accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”",935
3573,"“Yes, or I will never see her again.”",936
3574,"“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must",937
3575,be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you,937
3576,"again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again",937
3577,if you _do_.”,937
3578,Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;,938
3579,"but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the",938
3580,"affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",938
3581,"“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me",939
3582,to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”,939
3583,"“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.",940
3584,"First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the",940
3585,"present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the",940
3586,library to myself as soon as may be.”,940
3587,"Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did",941
3588,Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;,941
3589,coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in,941
3590,"her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined",941
3591,"interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and",941
3592,"sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner",941
3593,"varied, however, her determination never did.",941
3594,"Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.",942
3595,He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin,942
3596,"could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other",942
3597,way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her,942
3598,deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.,942
3599,"While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend",943
3600,"the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to",943
3601,"her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such",943
3602,fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has,943
3603,"made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”",943
3604,[Illustration:,944
3605,     “they entered the breakfast room”,945
3606,],945
3607,"Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,",946
3608,who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the,946
3609,"breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on",946
3610,"the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating",946
3611,her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her,946
3612,"family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;",946
3613,"“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,",946
3614,nobody feels for my poor nerves.”,946
3615,Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.,947
3616,"“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as",948
3617,"may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she",948
3618,"can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it",948
3619,"into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,",948
3620,you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is,948
3621,to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep,948
3622,you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told,948
3623,"you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,",948
3624,and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking,948
3625,"to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking",948
3626,to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have,948
3627,no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it,948
3628,is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”,948
3629,"Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any",949
3630,attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.,949
3631,"She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till",949
3632,"they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately",949
3633,"than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--",949
3634,"“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and",950
3635,let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”,950
3636,"Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but",951
3637,"Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,",951
3638,"detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after",951
3639,"herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little",951
3640,"curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending",951
3641,not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected,951
3642,conversation:--,951
3643,"“Oh, Mr. Collins!”",952
3644,"“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.",953
3645,"Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his",953
3646,"displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to",953
3647,inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man,953
3648,"who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I",953
3649,"trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my",953
3650,positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I,953
3651,"have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the",953
3652,blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.,953
3653,"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your",953
3654,"family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your",953
3655,"daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the",953
3656,compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.,953
3657,"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my",953
3658,dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all,953
3659,liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.,953
3660,"My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due",953
3661,consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_,953
3662,"has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”",953
3663,[Illustration],957
3664,CHAPTER XXI.,961
3665,[Illustration],963
3666,"The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and",964
3667,Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily,964
3668,"attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.",964
3669,"As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not",964
3670,"by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by",964
3671,stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to,964
3672,her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of,964
3673,"himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose",964
3674,"civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and",964
3675,especially to her friend.,964
3676,The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill,965
3677,health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth,965
3678,"had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did",965
3679,not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on,965
3680,"Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.",965
3681,"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham",966
3682,"were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.",966
3683,"He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their",966
3684,"aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were",966
3685,"well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged",966
3686,that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.,966
3687,"“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet",967
3688,"Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so",967
3689,"many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes",967
3690,might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”,967
3691,She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full,968
3692,"discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly",968
3693,"bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with",968
3694,"them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.",968
3695,His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the,968
3696,compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an,968
3697,occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.,968
3698,[Illustration: “Walked back with them”,969
3699,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],970
3700,"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came",971
3701,"from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a",971
3702,"sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s",971
3703,"fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as",971
3704,"she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.",971
3705,"Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to",971
3706,"join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but",971
3707,Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention,971
3708,"even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,",971
3709,than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they,971
3710,"had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is",971
3711,from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.,971
3712,"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way",971
3713,to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear,971
3714,what she says.”,971
3715,"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information",972
3716,"of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,",972
3717,"and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.",972
3718,Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to,972
3719,"regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my",972
3720,"dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many",972
3721,"returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the",972
3722,meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most,972
3723,unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these,972
3724,high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of,972
3725,"distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she",972
3726,saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their,972
3727,absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as,972
3728,"to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon",972
3729,cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.,972
3730,"“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be",973
3731,able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not,973
3732,"hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks",973
3733,"forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful",973
3734,intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater,973
3735,satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by,973
3736,them.”,973
3737,“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into,974
3738,Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.,974
3739,"“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which",975
3740,took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we,975
3741,"are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when",975
3742,"Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have",975
3743,"determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend",975
3744,his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are,975
3745,"already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest",975
3746,"friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I",975
3747,despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in,975
3748,"the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux",975
3749,will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of,975
3750,whom we shall deprive you.’,975
3751,"“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this",976
3752,winter.”,976
3753,“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”,977
3754,“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.,978
3755,But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which,978
3756,particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is,978
3757,"impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely",978
3758,less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has,978
3759,"her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection",978
3760,she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still,978
3761,more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being,978
3762,hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to,978
3763,"you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country",978
3764,"without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them",978
3765,unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have,978
3766,frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her,978
3767,relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s,978
3768,"partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most",978
3769,capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to,978
3770,"favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest",978
3771,"Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness",978
3772,"of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said",978
3773,"Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly",978
3774,declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;,978
3775,that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that,978
3776,if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most,978
3777,kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the,978
3778,subject?”,978
3779,"“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”",979
3780,“Most willingly.”,980
3781,“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is,981
3782,in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to,981
3783,"town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he",981
3784,does not care about you.”,981
3785,Jane shook her head.,982
3786,"“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you",983
3787,"together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she",983
3788,is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.,983
3789,"Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the",983
3790,case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she,983
3791,"is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion",983
3792,"that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble",983
3793,"in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I",983
3794,"dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my",983
3795,"dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley",983
3796,"tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest",983
3797,degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on,983
3798,"Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead",983
3799,"of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”",983
3800,"“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your",984
3801,representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the,984
3802,foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving,984
3803,"anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived",984
3804,herself.”,984
3805,"“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you",985
3806,"will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.",985
3807,"You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”",985
3808,"“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in",986
3809,accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry,986
3810,elsewhere?”,986
3811,"“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature",987
3812,"deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is",987
3813,"more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,",987
3814,"by all means, to refuse him.”",987
3815,"“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,",988
3816,"though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could",988
3817,not hesitate.”,988
3818,"“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider",989
3819,your situation with much compassion.”,989
3820,"“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be",990
3821,required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”,990
3822,The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost,991
3823,contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s,991
3824,interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those,991
3825,"wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man",991
3826,so totally independent of everyone.,991
3827,"She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on",992
3828,"the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.",992
3829,"Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,",992
3830,"though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that",992
3831,"Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.",992
3832,They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the,993
3833,"family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;",993
3834,"but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,",993
3835,and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen,993
3836,to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After,993
3837,"lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of",993
3838,"thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at",993
3839,"Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,",993
3840,"that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take",993
3841,care to have two full courses.,993
3842,[Illustration],997
3843,CHAPTER XXII.,1001
3844,[Illustration],1003
3845,"The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the",1004
3846,"chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.",1004
3847,Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good,1004
3848,"humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”",1004
3849,"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and",1005
3850,that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was,1005
3851,very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth,1005
3852,had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her,1005
3853,"from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards",1005
3854,herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so,1005
3855,"favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost",1005
3856,sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.,1005
3857,But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his,1005
3858,character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next,1005
3859,"morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw",1005
3860,"himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,",1005
3861,"from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to",1005
3862,"conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known",1005
3863,"till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost",1005
3864,"secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,",1005
3865,he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His,1005
3866,"reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas",1005
3867,"perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and",1005
3868,instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had,1005
3869,she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.,1005
3870,"In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,",1006
3871,everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as,1006
3872,"they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that",1006
3873,was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must,1006
3874,"be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with",1006
3875,his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must,1006
3876,guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its,1006
3877,"continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and",1006
3878,"disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that",1006
3879,establishment were gained.,1006
3880,Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;,1007
3881,and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present,1007
3882,"circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom",1007
3883,they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were,1007
3884,"exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more",1007
3885,interest than the matter had ever,1007
3886,[Illustration:,1008
3887,     “So much love and eloquence”,1009

3890,"Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins",1011
3891,"should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly",1011
3892,expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.,1011
3893,James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the,1011
3894,occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two,1011
3895,sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved,1011
3896,from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte,1011
3897,"herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time",1011
3898,to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.,1011
3899,"Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was",1011
3900,"irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would",1011
3901,"be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,",1011
3902,marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable,1011
3903,"provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however",1011
3904,"uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative",1011
3905,from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of,1011
3906,"twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good",1011
3907,luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the,1011
3908,"surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she",1011
3909,"valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and",1011
3910,probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be,1011
3911,"shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved",1011
3912,"to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,",1011
3913,"when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had",1011
3914,passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very,1011
3915,"dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the",1011
3916,curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct,1011
3917,"questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was",1011
3918,"at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to",1011
3919,publish his prosperous love.,1011
3920,As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of,1012
3921,"the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies",1012
3922,"moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and",1012
3923,"cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,",1012
3924,whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.,1012
3925,"“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly",1013
3926,"gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you",1013
3927,may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as,1013
3928,possible.”,1013
3929,"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for",1014
3930,"so speedy a return, immediately said,--",1014
3931,"“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my",1015
3932,good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of,1015
3933,offending your patroness.”,1015
3934,"“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you",1016
3935,"for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so",1016
3936,material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”,1016
3937,“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her,1017
3938,displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us,1017
3939,"again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,",1017
3940,and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”,1017
3941,"“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such",1018
3942,"affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive",1018
3943,from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of,1018
3944,"your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,",1018
3945,"though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall",1018
3946,"now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting",1018
3947,my cousin Elizabeth.”,1018
3948,"With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally",1019
3949,surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished,1019
3950,to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of,1019
3951,"her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.",1019
3952,She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a,1019
3953,solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no,1019
3954,"means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and",1019
3955,"improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very",1019
3956,agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this,1019
3957,"kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a",1019
3958,private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.,1019
3959,The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her,1020
3960,friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but,1020
3961,that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility,1020
3962,as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was,1020
3963,"consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and",1020
3964,"she could not help crying out,--",1020
3965,"“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”",1021
3966,The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her,1022
3967,story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a,1022
3968,"reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained",1022
3969,"her composure, and calmly replied,--",1022
3970,"“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible",1023
3971,"that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,",1023
3972,because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”,1023
3973,"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort",1024
3974,"for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the",1024
3975,"prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she",1024
3976,wished her all imaginable happiness.,1024
3977,"“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,",1025
3978,"very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.",1025
3979,"But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be",1025
3980,"satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never",1025
3981,"was. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s",1025
3982,"character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my",1025
3983,chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on,1025
3984,entering the marriage state.”,1025
3985,"Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,",1026
3986,they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much,1026
3987,longer; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It,1026
3988,was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so,1026
3989,unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers,1026
3990,of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now,1026
3991,accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was,1026
3992,not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible,1026
3993,"that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better",1026
3994,"feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a",1026
3995,most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing,1026
3996,"herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction",1026
3997,that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot,1026
3998,she had chosen.,1026

4002,CHAPTER XXIII.,1036
4003,[Illustration],1038
4004,"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what",1039
4005,"she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,",1039
4006,"when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to",1039
4007,"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,",1039
4008,and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the,1039
4009,"houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,",1039
4010,"but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than",1039
4011,"politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always",1039
4012,"unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--",1039
4013,"“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know",1040
4014,that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”,1040
4015,Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne,1041
4016,without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried,1041
4017,him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the,1041
4018,"truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the",1041
4019,most forbearing courtesy.,1041
4020,"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant",1042
4021,"a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by",1042
4022,mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and,1042
4023,"endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,",1042
4024,"by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she",1042
4025,"was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the",1042
4026,"happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character",1042
4027,"of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.",1042
4028,"Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while",1043
4029,Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings,1043
4030,"found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving",1043
4031,"the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins",1043
4032,"had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy",1043
4033,"together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two",1043
4034,"inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that",1043
4035,"Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that",1043
4036,she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two,1043
4037,points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could,1043
4038,console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her,1043
4039,resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without,1043
4040,scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William,1043
4041,or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she,1043
4042,could at all forgive their daughter.,1043
4043,"Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such",1044
4044,as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for,1044
4045,"it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had",1044
4046,"been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and",1044
4047,more foolish than his daughter!,1044
4048,Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said,1045
4049,less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;,1045
4050,nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and,1045
4051,"Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a",1045
4052,clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news,1045
4053,to spread at Meryton.,1045
4054,Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on,1046
4055,Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she,1046
4056,"called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,",1046
4057,though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been,1046
4058,enough to drive happiness away.,1046
4059,Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them,1047
4060,mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no,1047
4061,real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her,1047
4062,disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her,1047
4063,"sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could",1047
4064,"never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as",1047
4065,"Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.",1047
4066,"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting",1048
4067,the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised,1048
4068,"letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their",1048
4069,"father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a",1048
4070,twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After,1048
4071,"discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,",1048
4072,"with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the",1048
4073,"affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained",1048
4074,that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had,1048
4075,been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at,1048
4076,"Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;",1048
4077,"for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that",1048
4078,"she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would",1048
4079,be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early,1048
4080,day for making him the happiest of men.,1048
4081,Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of,1049
4082,"pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to",1049
4083,complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come,1049
4084,to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient,1049
4085,and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house,1049
4086,"while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the",1049
4087,"most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they",1049
4088,gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued,1049
4089,absence.,1049
4090,Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after,1050
4091,day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the,1050
4092,report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to,1050
4093,Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.,1050
4094,"Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous",1050
4095,falsehood.,1050
4096,Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that,1051
4097,his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she,1051
4098,"was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so",1051
4099,"dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its",1051
4100,"frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,",1051
4101,"and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss",1051
4102,"Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for",1051
4103,the strength of his attachment.,1051
4104,"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more",1052
4105,painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of,1052
4106,"concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject",1052
4107,"was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an",1052
4108,"hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her",1052
4109,"impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he",1052
4110,did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all,1052
4111,Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable,1052
4112,tranquillity.,1052
4113,"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his",1053
4114,reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his,1053
4115,"first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;",1053
4116,"and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them",1053
4117,from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by,1053
4118,"him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time",1053
4119,to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.,1053
4120,[Illustration:,1054
4121,     “_Whenever she spoke in a low voice_”,1055
4122,],1055
4123,Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of,1056
4124,"anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and",1056
4125,wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of,1056
4126,"Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she",1056
4127,regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see,1056
4128,"them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and",1056
4129,"whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that",1056
4130,"they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself",1056
4131,and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She,1056
4132,complained bitterly of all this to her husband.,1056
4133,"“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte",1057
4134,"Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced",1057
4135,"to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”",1057
4136,"“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for",1058
4137,better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.”,1058
4138,"This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet; and, therefore, instead of",1059
4139,"making any answer, she went on as before.",1059
4140,“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was,1060
4141,"not for the entail, I should not mind it.”",1060
4142,“What should not you mind?”,1061
4143,“I should not mind anything at all.”,1062
4144,“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such,1063
4145,insensibility.”,1063
4146,"“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How",1064
4147,anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own,1064
4148,"daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins, too!",1064
4149,Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”,1064
4150,"“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.",1065

4152,CHAPTER XXIV.,1073
4153,[Illustration],1075
4154,"Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first",1076
4155,sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for,1076
4156,"the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had",1076
4157,time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left,1076
4158,the country.,1076
4159,"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of",1077
4160,"the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the",1077
4161,"writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied",1077
4162,the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline,1077
4163,"boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict",1077
4164,the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former,1077
4165,letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an,1077
4166,"inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of",1077
4167,the latter with regard to new furniture.,1077
4168,"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,",1078
4169,heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern,1078
4170,for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s,1078
4171,"assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no",1078
4172,"credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she",1078
4173,"had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she",1078
4174,"could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness",1078
4175,"of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave",1078
4176,"of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to",1078
4177,"the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been",1078
4178,"the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in",1078
4179,"whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as",1078
4180,"she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on",1078
4181,"which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She",1078
4182,"could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had",1078
4183,"really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;",1078
4184,"whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had",1078
4185,"escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of",1078
4186,"him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s",1078
4187,"situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",1078
4188,A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to,1079
4189,"Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a",1079
4190,"longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could",1079
4191,"not help saying,--",1079
4192,“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no,1080
4193,idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I,1080
4194,"will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall",1080
4195,all be as we were before.”,1080
4196,"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said",1081
4197,nothing.,1081
4198,"“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no",1082
4199,reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my,1082
4200,"acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and",1082
4201,nothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little,1082
4202,"time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”",1082
4203,"With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,",1083
4204,"that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it",1083
4205,has done no harm to anyone but myself.”,1083
4206,"“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness",1084
4207,and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to,1084
4208,"you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you",1084
4209,deserve.”,1084
4210,"Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back",1085
4211,the praise on her sister’s warm affection.,1085
4212,"“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the",1086
4213,"world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want",1086
4214,"to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be",1086
4215,"afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your",1086
4216,privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people,1086
4217,"whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see",1086
4218,of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms,1086
4219,"my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the",1086
4220,little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit,1086
4221,"or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,",1086
4222,the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it,1086
4223,is unaccountable!”,1086
4224,"“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will",1087
4225,ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of,1087
4226,"situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and",1087
4227,"Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a",1087
4228,large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be,1087
4229,"ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like",1087
4230,regard and esteem for our cousin.”,1087
4231,"“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else",1088
4232,could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that,1088
4233,"Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her",1088
4234,"understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a",1088
4235,"conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as",1088
4236,"I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him",1088
4237,"cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though",1088
4238,"it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,",1088
4239,"change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade",1088
4240,"yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of",1088
4241,danger security for happiness.”,1088
4242,"“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied",1089
4243,"Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy",1089
4244,together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You,1089
4245,"mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat",1089
4246,"you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and",1089
4247,saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy,1089
4248,ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man,1089
4249,to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but,1089
4250,our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than,1089
4251,it does.”,1089
4252,“And men take care that they should.”,1090
4253,"“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea",1091
4254,of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”,1091
4255,"“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”",1092
4256,"said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others",1092
4257,"unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,",1092
4258,"want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,",1092
4259,will do the business.”,1092
4260,“And do you impute it to either of those?”,1093
4261,“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I,1094
4262,"think of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”",1094
4263,"“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”",1095
4264,"“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”",1096
4265,“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can,1097
4266,only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can,1097
4267,secure it.”,1097
4268,“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his,1098
4269,happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they,1098
4270,"may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great",1098
4271,"connections, and pride.”",1098
4272,"“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;",1099
4273,“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have,1099
4274,known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love,1099
4275,"her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely",1099
4276,they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think,1099
4277,"herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very",1099
4278,objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to,1099
4279,"part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an",1099
4280,"affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most",1099
4281,unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been,1099
4282,"mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of",1099
4283,what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it,1099
4284,"in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”",1099
4285,Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s,1100
4286,name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.,1100
4287,Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no,1101
4288,more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account,1101
4289,"for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it",1101
4290,with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what,1101
4291,"she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely",1101
4292,"the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw",1101
4293,her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at,1101
4294,"the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best",1101
4295,"comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.",1101
4296,"Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one",1102
4297,"day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next",1102
4298,"to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and",1102
4299,"then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction",1102
4300,among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to,1102
4301,be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at,1102
4302,Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham,1102
4303,"be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”",1102
4304,"“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not",1103
4305,all expect Jane’s good fortune.”,1103
4306,"“True,” said Mr. Bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of",1104
4307,"that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will",1104
4308,always make the most of it.”,1104
4309,Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom,1105
4310,which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn,1105
4311,"family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now",1105
4312,added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already,1105
4313,"heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,",1105
4314,was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was,1105
4315,pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they,1105
4316,had known anything of the matter.,1105
4317,Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any,1106
4318,extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of,1106
4319,Hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for,1106
4320,"allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else",1106
4321,Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.,1106
4322,[Illustration],1110
4323,CHAPTER XXV.,1114
4324,[Illustration],1116
4325,"After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr.",1117
4326,Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of,1117
4327,"Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his",1117
4328,"side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to",1117
4329,"hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day",1117
4330,would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave,1117
4331,of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished,1117
4332,"his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father",1117
4333,another letter of thanks.,1117
4334,"On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her",1118
4335,"brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the Christmas at",1118
4336,"Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly",1118
4337,"superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield",1118
4338,ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by,1118
4339,"trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so",1118
4340,"well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger",1118
4341,"than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant",1118
4342,"woman, and a great favourite with her Longbourn nieces. Between the two",1118
4343,"eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.",1118
4344,They had frequently been staying with her in town.,1118
4345,"The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to",1119
4346,distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was,1119
4347,"done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.",1119
4348,"Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They",1119
4349,had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her,1119
4350,"girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing",1119
4351,in it.,1119
4352,"“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.",1120
4353,"Bingley if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think",1120
4354,"that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it",1120
4355,"been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,",1120
4356,"and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have",1120
4357,"a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as",1120
4358,"much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people, indeed,",1120
4359,sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of,1120
4360,"them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted",1120
4361,"so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves",1120
4362,"before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the",1120
4363,"greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of",1120
4364,long sleeves.”,1120
4365,"Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in",1121
4366,"the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her",1121
4367,"sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the",1121
4368,conversation.,1121
4369,"When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.",1122
4370,"“It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I",1122
4371,"am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man,",1122
4372,"such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty",1122
4373,"girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily",1122
4374,"forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”",1122

4376,     “Offended two or three young ladies”,1124
4377,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1125
4378,"“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth; “but it will not",1126
4379,do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen,1126
4380,that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of,1126
4381,independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in,1126
4382,love with only a few days before.”,1126
4383,"“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so",1127
4384,"doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as",1127
4385,often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s,1127
4386,"acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_",1127
4387,Mr. Bingley’s love?”,1127
4388,“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite,1128
4389,"inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time",1128
4390,"they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he",1128
4391,offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I,1128
4392,spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be,1128
4393,finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”,1128
4394,"“Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor",1129
4395,"Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get",1129
4396,"over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you",1129
4397,would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would,1129
4398,be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of,1129
4399,service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as,1129
4400,anything.”,1129
4401,"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded",1130
4402,of her sister’s ready acquiescence.,1130
4403,"“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to",1131
4404,this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of,1131
4405,"town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go",1131
4406,"out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,",1131
4407,unless he really comes to see her.”,1131
4408,“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his,1132
4409,"friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a",1132
4410,"part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,",1132
4411,"perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he",1132
4412,would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its,1132
4413,"impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley",1132
4414,never stirs without him.”,1132
4415,“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane,1133
4416,correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”,1133
4417,“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”,1134
4418,"But, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this",1135
4419,"point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being",1135
4420,"withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which",1135
4421,"convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely",1135
4422,"hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that",1135
4423,"his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends",1135
4424,successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s,1135
4425,attractions.,1135
4426,Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the,1136
4427,Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she,1136
4428,"hoped, by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she",1136
4429,"might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of",1136
4430,seeing him.,1136
4431,"The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,",1137
4432,"the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its",1137
4433,engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment,1137
4434,"of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family",1137
4435,"dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always",1137
4436,"made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and",1137
4437,"on these occasions Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s",1137
4438,"warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing",1137
4439,"them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference",1137
4440,of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she,1137
4441,resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left,1137
4442,"Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such",1137
4443,an attachment.,1137
4444,"To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,",1138
4445,"unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,",1138
4446,"before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part",1138
4447,"of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many",1138
4448,"acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since",1138
4449,"the death of Darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power",1138
4450,to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been,1138
4451,in the way of procuring.,1138
4452,"Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by",1139
4453,"character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible",1139
4454,subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with,1139
4455,"the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her",1139
4456,"tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was",1139
4457,delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the,1139
4458,"present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of",1139
4459,"that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might",1139
4460,"agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having",1139
4461,"heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,",1139
4462,ill-natured boy.,1139

4466,CHAPTER XXVI.,1148
4467,[Illustration],1150
4468,Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on,1151
4469,the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after,1151
4470,"honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--",1151
4471,"“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you",1152
4472,"are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking",1152
4473,"openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve",1152
4474,"yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of",1152
4475,fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against,1152
4476,_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he,1152
4477,"ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you",1152
4478,"must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all",1152
4479,expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and,1152
4480,"good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”",1152
4481,"“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”",1153
4482,"“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”",1154
4483,"“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of",1155
4484,"myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I",1155
4485,can prevent it.”,1155
4486,"“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”",1156
4487,“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with,1157
4488,"Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,",1157
4489,the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to,1157
4490,me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence,1157
4491,"of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does",1157
4492,me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My,1157
4493,"father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I",1157
4494,should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but,1157
4495,"since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are",1157
4496,"seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into",1157
4497,"engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many",1157
4498,"of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that",1157
4499,"it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is",1157
4500,not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his,1157
4501,"first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In",1157
4502,"short, I will do my best.”",1157
4503,“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very,1158
4504,often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”,1158
4505,"“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very",1159
4506,"true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine",1159
4507,that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been,1159
4508,so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the,1159
4509,"necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my",1159
4510,"honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you",1159
4511,are satisfied.”,1159
4512,"Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for",1160
4513,"the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice",1160
4514,being given on such a point without being resented.,1160
4515,Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted,1161
4516,"by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the",1161
4517,"Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His",1161
4518,marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned,1161
4519,"as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured",1161
4520,"tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the",1161
4521,"wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and",1161
4522,"when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s",1161
4523,"ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,",1161
4524,"accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,",1161
4525,"Charlotte said,--",1161
4526,"“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”",1162
4527,“_That_ you certainly shall.”,1163
4528,“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”,1164
4529,"“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”",1165
4530,"“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to",1166
4531,come to Hunsford.”,1166
4532,"Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the",1167
4533,visit.,1167
4534,"“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and",1168
4535,"I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be",1168
4536,as welcome to me as either of them.”,1168
4537,The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from,1169
4538,"the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the",1169
4539,"subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their",1169
4540,correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it,1169
4541,should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never,1169
4542,address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;,1169
4543,"and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the",1169
4544,sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters,1169
4545,were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be,1169
4546,"curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would",1169
4547,"like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to",1169
4548,"be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte",1169
4549,expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She,1169
4550,"wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing",1169
4551,"which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and",1169
4552,"roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most",1169
4553,friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and,1169
4554,Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait,1169
4555,"for her own visit there, to know the rest.",1169
4556,"Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their",1170
4557,"safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it",1170
4558,would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.,1170
4559,Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience,1171
4560,"generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or",1171
4561,"hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that",1171
4562,her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been,1171
4563,lost.,1171
4564,"“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the",1172
4565,"town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”",1172
4566,"She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.",1173
4567,"“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very",1173
4568,"glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming",1173
4569,"to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.",1173
4570,"I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much",1173
4571,engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that,1173
4572,Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was,1173
4573,"not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall",1173
4574,soon see them here.”,1173
4575,Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that,1174
4576,accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.,1174
4577,"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to",1175
4578,persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be,1175
4579,blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning,1175
4580,"for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the",1175
4581,"visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet",1175
4582,"more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself",1175
4583,no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister,1175
4584,will prove what she felt:--,1175
4585,"     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in",1176
4586,"     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have",1176
4587,"     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my",1176
4588,"     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me",1176
4589,"     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour",1176
4590,"     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at",1176
4591,"     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,",1176
4592,"     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should",1176
4593,     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;,1176
4594,"     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she",1176
4595,"     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she",1176
4596,"     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a",1176
4597,"     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so",1176
4598,"     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly",1176
4599,"     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I",1176
4600,"     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as",1176
4601,"     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on",1176
4602,"     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been",1176
4603,"     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her",1176
4604,     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and,1176
4605,"     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she",1176
4606,"     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so",1176
4607,"     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may",1176
4608,"     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,",1176
4609,"     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all",1176
4610,"     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my",1176
4611,"     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and",1176
4612,"     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to",1176
4613,     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot,1176
4614,"     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be",1176
4615,"     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of",1176
4616,     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful,1176
4617,"     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,",1176
4618,     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear,1176
4619,     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never,1176
4620,"     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not",1176
4621,     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely,1176
4622,     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at,1176
4623,"     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am",1176
4624,     sure you will be very comfortable there.,1176
4625,"“Yours, etc.”",1177
4626,"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she",1178
4627,"considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.",1178
4628,All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not,1178
4629,even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every,1178
4630,"review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible",1178
4631,"advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.",1178
4632,"Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly",1178
4633,regret what he had thrown away.,1178
4634,Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise,1179
4635,"concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had",1179
4636,such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to,1179
4637,"herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,",1179
4638,he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to,1179
4639,"see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.",1179
4640,"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied",1179
4641,"with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune",1179
4642,permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most,1179
4643,remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself,1179
4644,"agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than",1179
4645,"in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.",1179
4646,"Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to",1179
4647,"suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was",1179
4648,"ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very",1179
4649,sincerely wish him happy.,1179
4650,"All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the",1180
4651,"circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,",1180
4652,that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that,1180
4653,"pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,",1180
4654,and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial,1180
4655,"towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find",1180
4656,"out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think",1180
4657,her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My,1180
4658,watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more,1180
4659,"interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love",1180
4660,"with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.",1180
4661,Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take,1180
4662,his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways,1180
4663,"of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that",1180
4664,handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the,1180
4665,plain.”,1180

4671,"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise",1192
4672,"diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and",1192
4673,"sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take",1192
4674,Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of,1192
4675,"going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the",1192
4676,"plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater",1192
4677,pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire,1192
4678,"of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.",1192
4679,"There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such",1192
4680,"uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change",1192
4681,"was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give",1192
4682,"her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have",1192
4683,"been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,",1192
4684,and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was,1192
4685,to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of,1192
4686,"spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as",1192
4687,perfect as plan could be.,1192
4688,"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,",1193
4689,"and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he",1193
4690,"told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.",1193
4691,The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on,1194
4692,his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that,1194
4693,"Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the",1194
4694,"first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner",1194
4695,"of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what",1194
4696,"she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their",1194
4697,"opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there",1194
4698,"was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to",1194
4699,"him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,",1194
4700,"whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable",1194
4701,and pleasing.,1194
4702,Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think,1195
4703,"him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a",1195
4704,"good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say",1195
4705,"that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much",1195
4706,"delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but",1195
4707,she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of,1195
4708,the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were,1195
4709,"worn out, like his information.",1195
4710,"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early",1196
4711,as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s,1196
4712,"door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when",1196
4713,"they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,",1196
4714,"looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and",1196
4715,"lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,",1196
4716,whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to,1196
4717,"wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her",1196
4718,"for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and",1196
4719,kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and,1196
4720,"shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.",1196
4721,Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her,1197
4722,"sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to",1197
4723,"her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her",1197
4724,"spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to",1197
4725,hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the,1197
4726,"particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and",1197
4727,repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and,1197
4728,"herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the",1197
4729,acquaintance.,1197
4730,"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and",1198
4731,complimented her on bearing it so well.,1198
4732,"“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I",1199
4733,should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”,1199
4734,"“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,",1200
4735,"between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,",1200
4736,"and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,",1200
4737,"because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a",1200
4738,"girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is",1200
4739,mercenary.”,1200
4740,"“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know",1201
4741,what to think.”,1201
4742,"“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”",1202
4743,“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death,1203
4744,made her mistress of this fortune?”,1203
4745,“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_,1204
4746,"affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for",1204
4747,"making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally",1204
4748,poor?”,1204
4749,“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so,1205
4750,soon after this event.”,1205
4751,“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant,1206
4752,"decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,",1206
4753,why should _we_?”,1206
4754,“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being,1207
4755,deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”,1207
4756,"“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be",1208
4757,"mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”",1208
4758,"“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,",1209
4759,to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”,1209
4760,"“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in",1210
4761,Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not,1210
4762,much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow,1210
4763,"where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has",1210
4764,neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones,1210
4765,"worth knowing, after all.”",1210
4766,"“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”",1211
4767,"Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the",1212
4768,unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in,1212
4769,a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.,1212
4770,"“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.",1213
4771,"Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”",1213
4772,"No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her",1214
4773,"acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear",1214
4774,"aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me",1214
4775,fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men,1214
4776,"to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And",1214
4777,"when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without",1214
4778,being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where,1214
4779,"we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,",1214
4780,"and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when",1214
4781,"we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling",1214
4782,about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less,1214
4783,insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”,1214

4789,Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to,1226
4790,Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had,1226
4791,"seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,",1226
4792,and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.,1226
4793,"When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in",1227
4794,"search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.",1227
4795,The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth,1227
4796,smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.,1227
4797,At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the,1228
4798,"road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,",1228
4799,everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte,1228
4800,"appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which",1228
4801,"led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of",1228
4802,"the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing",1228
4803,at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the,1228
4804,"liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with",1228
4805,"coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw",1228
4806,instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:,1228
4807,his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some,1228
4808,minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her,1228
4809,"family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the",1228
4810,"neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were",1228
4811,"in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious",1228
4812,"formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s",1228
4813,offers of refreshment.,1228
4814,Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help,1229
4815,"fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,",1229
4816,"and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if",1229
4817,wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though,1229
4818,"everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him",1229
4819,"by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,",1229
4820,that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.,1229
4821,"Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,",1229
4822,"which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on",1229
4823,Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general,1229
4824,Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire,1229
4825,"every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the",1229
4826,"fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had",1229
4827,"happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the",1229
4828,"garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of",1229
4829,which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most,1229
4830,respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance,1229
4831,"with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and",1229
4832,"owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way",1229
4833,"through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an",1229
4834,"interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out",1229
4835,with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the,1229
4836,"fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in",1229
4837,"the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which",1229
4838,"the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with",1229
4839,"the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that",1229
4840,bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a,1229
4841,"handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.",1229
4842,"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;",1230
4843,"but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white",1230
4844,"frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte",1230
4845,"took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,",1230
4846,"probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s",1230
4847,"help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything",1230
4848,"was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which",1230
4849,Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be,1230
4850,"forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by",1230
4851,"Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often",1230
4852,forgotten.,1230
4853,She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It,1231
4854,"was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining",1231
4855,"in, observed,--",1231
4856,"“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine",1232
4857,"de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will",1232
4858,"be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I",1232
4859,doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when,1232
4860,service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will,1232
4861,include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she,1232
4862,honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is,1232
4863,"charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to",1232
4864,walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I,1232
4865,"_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”",1232
4866,"“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added",1233
4867,"Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”",1233
4868,"“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of",1234
4869,woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”,1234
4870,"The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and",1235
4871,"telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,",1235
4872,"Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon",1235
4873,"Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,",1235
4874,"and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it",1235
4875,was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would,1235
4876,"pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious",1235
4877,"interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse",1235
4878,with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.,1235
4879,"About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready",1236
4880,"for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in",1236
4881,"confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running",1236
4882,"upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened",1236
4883,"the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with",1236
4884,"agitation, cried out,--",1236
4885,[Illustration:,1237
4886,     “In Conversation with the ladies”,1238
4887,[Copyright 1894 by George Allen.]],1239
4888,"“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for",1240
4889,there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make,1240
4890,"haste, and come down this moment.”",1240
4891,Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;,1241
4892,"and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest",1241
4893,"of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the",1241
4894,garden gate.,1241
4895,“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs,1242
4896,"were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her",1242
4897,daughter!”,1242
4898,"“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady",1243
4899,"Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The",1243
4900,other is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little,1243
4901,creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”,1243
4902,“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.,1244
4903,Why does she not come in?”,1244
4904,"“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours",1245
4905,when Miss De Bourgh comes in.”,1245
4906,"“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She",1246
4907,"looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will",1246
4908,make him a very proper wife.”,1246
4909,Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation,1247
4910,"with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was",1247
4911,"stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness",1247
4912,"before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that",1247
4913,way.,1247
4914,"At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and",1248
4915,the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two,1248
4916,"girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which",1248
4917,Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked,1248
4918,to dine at Rosings the next day.,1248

4922,CHAPTER XXIX.,1258
4923,[Illustration],1260
4924,"Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.",1261
4925,The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering,1261
4926,"visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his",1261
4927,"wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of",1261
4928,doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady,1261
4929,Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.,1261
4930,"“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by",1262
4931,her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening,1262
4932,"at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that",1262
4933,it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?,1262
4934,Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine,1262
4935,"there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so",1262
4936,immediately after your arrival?”,1262
4937,"“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,",1263
4938,"“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which",1263
4939,"my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such",1263
4940,instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”,1263
4941,Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their,1264
4942,visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what,1264
4943,"they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and",1264
4944,"so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.",1264
4945,"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to",1265
4946,"Elizabeth,--",1265
4947,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady",1266
4948,Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which,1266
4949,becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on,1266
4950,whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion,1266
4951,for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for,1266
4952,being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank,1266
4953,preserved.”,1266
4954,"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different",1267
4955,"doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much",1267
4956,objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of,1267
4957,"her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,",1267
4958,who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her,1267
4959,introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done,1267
4960,to his presentation at St. James’s.,1267
4961,"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile",1268
4962,across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and,1268
4963,"Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such",1268
4964,"raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but",1268
4965,slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the,1268
4966,"house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally",1268
4967,cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.,1268
4968,"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment",1269
4969,"increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.",1269
4970,Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady,1269
4971,Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or,1269
4972,"miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she",1269
4973,thought she could witness without trepidation.,1269
4974,"From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a",1270
4975,"rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed",1270
4976,"the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,",1270
4977,"her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great",1270
4978,"condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it",1270
4979,"with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was",1270
4980,"performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks",1270
4981,which he would have thought necessary.,1270
4982,"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely",1271
4983,"awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage",1271
4984,"enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;",1271
4985,"and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge",1271
4986,"of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself",1271
4987,"quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her",1271
4988,"composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked",1271
4989,"features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not",1271
4990,"conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her",1271
4991,visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by,1271
4992,silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as,1271
4993,"marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to",1271
4994,"Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she",1271
4995,believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.,1271
4996,"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment",1272
4997,"she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the",1272
4998,"daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her",1272
4999,being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any,1272
5000,likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her,1272
5001,"features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very",1272
5002,"little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance",1272
5003,"there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening",1272
5004,"to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before",1272
5005,her eyes.,1272
5006,"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to",1273
5007,"admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,",1273
5008,and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth,1273
5009,looking at in the summer.,1273
5010,"The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,",1274
5011,"and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he",1274
5012,"had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by",1274
5013,"her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish",1274
5014,nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;,1274
5015,"and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who",1274
5016,"was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a",1274
5017,manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady,1274
5018,"Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most",1274
5019,"gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty",1274
5020,to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready,1274
5021,"to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between",1274
5022,Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in,1274
5023,"listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all",1274
5024,the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how,1274
5025,"little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and",1274
5026,"fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,",1274
5027,and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.,1274
5028,"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be",1275
5029,"done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any",1275
5030,"intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every",1275
5031,subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have,1275
5032,her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic,1275
5033,"concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as",1275
5034,to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be,1275
5035,"regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the",1275
5036,care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was,1275
5037,beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an,1275
5038,occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with,1275
5039,"Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and",1275
5040,"Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew",1275
5041,"the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,",1275
5042,pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters,1275
5043,"she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of",1275
5044,"them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they",1275
5045,"had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her",1275
5046,mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her,1275
5047,"questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then",1275
5048,"observed,--",1275
5049,"“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your",1276
5050,"sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no",1276
5051,occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought,1276
5052,"necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss",1276
5053,Bennet?”,1276
5054,“A little.”,1277
5055,“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our,1278
5056,"instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it",1278
5057,some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”,1278
5058,“One of them does.”,1279
5059,“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss,1280
5060,"Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do",1280
5061,you draw?”,1280
5062,"“No, not at all.”",1281
5063,"“What, none of you?”",1282
5064,“Not one.”,1283
5065,“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother,1284
5066,should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”,1284
5067,"“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”",1285
5068,“Has your governess left you?”,1286
5069,“We never had any governess.”,1287
5070,“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home,1288
5071,without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must,1288
5072,have been quite a slave to your education.”,1288
5073,"Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not",1289
5074,been the case.,1289
5075,"“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must",1290
5076,have been neglected.”,1290
5077,"“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as",1291
5078,wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to,1291
5079,"read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be",1291
5080,idle certainly might.”,1291
5081,"“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had",1292
5082,"known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage",1292
5083,one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady,1292
5084,"and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is",1292
5085,wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that,1292
5086,way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces,1292
5087,of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and,1292
5088,"it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who",1292
5089,"was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite",1292
5090,"delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s",1292
5091,calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady,1292
5092,"Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your",1292
5093,"younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”",1292
5094,"“Yes, ma’am, all.”",1293
5095,"“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The",1294
5096,younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must,1294
5097,be very young?”,1294
5098,"“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much",1295
5099,"in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon",1295
5100,younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and,1295
5101,"amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to",1295
5102,marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth,1295
5103,as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would,1295
5104,not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”,1295
5105,"“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly",1296
5106,"for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”",1296
5107,"“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your",1297
5108,Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”,1297
5109,Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;,1298
5110,and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever,1298
5111,dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.,1298
5112,"“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not",1299
5113,conceal your age.”,1299
5114,“I am not one-and-twenty.”,1300
5115,"When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables",1301
5116,"were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat",1301
5117,"down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the",1301
5118,two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her,1301
5119,party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was,1301
5120,"uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson",1301
5121,"expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or",1301
5122,having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the,1301
5123,other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes,1301
5124,"of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins",1301
5125,"was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her",1301
5126,"for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.",1301
5127,Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes,1301
5128,and noble names.,1301
5129,"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,",1302
5130,"the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,",1302
5131,"gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered",1302
5132,round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were,1302
5133,to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the,1302
5134,arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.,1302
5135,"Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As",1302
5136,"soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her",1302
5137,"cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,",1302
5138,"for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But",1302
5139,"her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means",1302
5140,"satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s",1302
5141,praise into his own hands.,1302
5142,[Illustration],1306
5143,CHAPTER XXX.,1310
5144,[Illustration],1312
5145,Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long,1313
5146,"enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,",1313
5147,and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not,1313
5148,"often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his",1313
5149,"mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but",1313
5150,"when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,",1313
5151,and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her,1313
5152,cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast,1313
5153,"and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in",1313
5154,"reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,",1313
5155,which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.,1313
5156,Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer,1313
5157,"the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a",1313
5158,pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent,1313
5159,"reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been",1313
5160,much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and,1313
5161,she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.,1313
5162,"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and",1314
5163,were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went,1314
5164,"along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,",1314
5165,"which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened",1314
5166,"almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had",1314
5167,"a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever",1314
5168,prevailed on to get out.,1314
5169,"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and",1315
5170,not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;,1315
5171,and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings,1315
5172,"to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many",1315
5173,"hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,",1315
5174,and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during,1315
5175,"these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,",1315
5176,and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement,1315
5177,"of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she",1315
5178,"accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding",1315
5179,out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.,1315
5180,"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the",1316
5181,"commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate",1316
5182,"in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by",1316
5183,Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be,1316
5184,"quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the",1316
5185,"village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold",1316
5186,them into harmony and plenty.,1316
5187,[Illustration:,1317
5188,     “he never failed to inform them”,1318
5189,],1318
5190,The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;,1319
5191,"and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one",1319
5192,"card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart",1319
5193,"of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living",1319
5194,"of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,",1319
5195,"however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time",1319
5196,comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with,1319
5197,"Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she",1319
5198,"had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where",1319
5199,"she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was",1319
5200,"along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was",1319
5201,"a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and",1319
5202,where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.,1319
5203,In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.,1320
5204,"Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an",1320
5205,"addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be",1320
5206,"important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy",1320
5207,was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were,1320
5208,"not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would",1320
5209,"furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and",1320
5210,she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him,1320
5211,"were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined",1320
5212,"by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest",1320
5213,"satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and",1320
5214,seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by,1320
5215,Miss Lucas and herself.,1320
5216,His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking,1321
5217,"the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,",1321
5218,in order to have,1321
5219,[Illustration:,1322
5220,“The gentlemen accompanied him.”,1323
5221,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1324
5222,"the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage",1325
5223,"turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the",1325
5224,following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were,1325
5225,"two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought",1325
5226,"with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;",1325
5227,"and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,",1325
5228,the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her,1325
5229,"husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the",1325
5230,"other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--",1325
5231,"“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would",1326
5232,never have come so soon to wait upon me.”,1326
5233,Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,1327
5234,"before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly",1327
5235,"afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,",1327
5236,"who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and",1327
5237,address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been,1327
5238,"used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual",1327
5239,"reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her",1327
5240,"friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely",1327
5241,"courtesied to him, without saying a word.",1327
5242,"Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the",1328
5243,"readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but",1328
5244,"his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and",1328
5245,"garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.",1328
5246,"At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of",1328
5247,Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual,1328
5248,"way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--",1328
5249,“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never,1329
5250,happened to see her there?”,1329
5251,She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see,1330
5252,whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the,1330
5253,Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he,1330
5254,answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The,1330
5255,"subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went",1330
5256,away.,1330
5257,[Illustration:,1334
5258,“At Church”,1335
5259,],1335
5260,CHAPTER XXXI.,1339
5261,[Illustration],1341
5262,"Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,",1342
5263,and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of,1342
5264,"their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they",1342
5265,"received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the",1342
5266,"house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,",1342
5267,"almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by",1342
5268,"such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to",1342
5269,come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little,1342
5270,of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called,1342
5271,"at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had",1342
5272,only seen at church.,1342
5273,"The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined",1343
5274,the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them,1343
5275,"civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so",1343
5276,"acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,",1343
5277,"almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,",1343
5278,much more than to any other person in the room.,1343
5279,Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a,1344
5280,"welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,",1344
5281,"moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and",1344
5282,"talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying",1344
5283,"at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so",1344
5284,well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much,1344
5285,"spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as",1344
5286,well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned,1344
5287,"towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a",1344
5288,"while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not",1344
5289,"scruple to call out,--",1344
5290,"“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking",1345
5291,of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”,1345
5292,"“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid",1346
5293,a reply.,1346
5294,“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I,1347
5295,"must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.",1347
5296,"There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true",1347
5297,"enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever",1347
5298,"learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her",1347
5299,health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have,1347
5300,"performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”",1347
5301,Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.,1348
5302,"“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady",1349
5303,"Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,",1349
5304,if she does not practise a great deal.”,1349
5305,"“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.",1350
5306,She practises very constantly.”,1350
5307,“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write,1351
5308,"to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often",1351
5309,"tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without",1351
5310,"constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will",1351
5311,"never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.",1351
5312,"Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told",1351
5313,"her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.",1351
5314,"Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part",1351
5315,of the house.”,1351
5316,"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made",1352
5317,no answer.,1352
5318,"When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having",1353
5319,promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He,1353
5320,"drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then",1353
5321,"talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from",1353
5322,"her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,",1353
5323,stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s,1353
5324,"countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first",1353
5325,"convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--",1353
5326,"“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear",1354
5327,"me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.",1354
5328,There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at,1354
5329,the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to,1354
5330,intimidate me.”,1354
5331,"“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could",1355
5332,not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I,1355
5333,"have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you",1355
5334,"find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,",1355
5335,are not your own.”,1355
5336,"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to",1356
5337,"Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of",1356
5338,"me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky",1356
5339,"in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a",1356
5340,part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree,1356
5341,"of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention",1356
5342,"all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me",1356
5343,"leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,",1356
5344,and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”,1356
5345,"“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.",1357
5346,"“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel",1358
5347,Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”,1358
5348,"“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The",1359
5349,"first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at",1359
5350,"a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four",1359
5351,"dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four",1359
5352,"dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more",1359
5353,"than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,",1359
5354,you cannot deny the fact.”,1359
5355,“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly,1360
5356,beyond my own party.”,1360
5357,"“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel",1361
5358,"Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”",1361
5359,"“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an",1362
5360,"introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”",1362
5361,"“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still",1363
5362,addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and,1363
5363,"education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend",1363
5364,himself to strangers?”,1363
5365,"“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to",1364
5366,him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”,1364
5367,"“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,",1365
5368,“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot,1365
5369,"catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their",1365
5370,"concerns, as I often see done.”",1365
5371,"“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the",1366
5372,masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same,1366
5373,"force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I",1366
5374,have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take,1366
5375,the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers,1366
5376,as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”,1366
5377,"Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your",1367
5378,time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can,1367
5379,think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”,1367
5380,"Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know",1368
5381,what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.,1368
5382,"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said",1368
5383,"to Darcy,--",1368
5384,"“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and",1369
5385,could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion,1369
5386,"of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have",1369
5387,"been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”",1369
5388,"Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his",1370
5389,cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she,1370
5390,discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss,1370
5391,"De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have",1370
5392,"been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.",1370
5393,"Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing",1371
5394,with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received,1371
5395,them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the,1371
5396,gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship’s carriage was,1371
5397,ready to take them all home.,1371
5398,[Illustration],1375

5400,[Illustration],1381
5401,"Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,",1382
5402,"while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,",1382
5403,"when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a",1382
5404,"visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be",1382
5405,Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her,1382
5406,"half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,",1382
5407,"when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.",1382
5408,"Darcy only, entered the room.",1382
5409,"He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his",1383
5410,"intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to",1383
5411,be within.,1383
5412,"They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,",1384
5413,seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely,1384
5414,"necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency",1384
5415,"recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling",1384
5416,curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty,1384
5417,"departure, she observed,--",1384
5418,"“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!",1385
5419,It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you,1385
5420,"all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day",1385
5421,"before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”",1385
5422,"“Perfectly so, I thank you.”",1386
5423,"She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short",1387
5424,"pause, added,--",1387
5425,“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever,1388
5426,returning to Netherfield again?”,1388
5427,“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend,1389
5428,"very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is",1389
5429,at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually,1389
5430,increasing.”,1389
5431,"“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the",1390
5432,"neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we",1390
5433,"might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did",1390
5434,not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as,1390
5435,"for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same",1390
5436,principle.”,1390
5437,"“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as",1391
5438,soon as any eligible purchase offers.”,1391
5439,Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his,1392
5440,"friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the",1392
5441,trouble of finding a subject to him.,1392
5442,"He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable",1393
5443,"house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.",1393
5444,Collins first came to Hunsford.”,1393
5445,“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her,1394
5446,kindness on a more grateful object.”,1394
5447,“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”,1395
5448,"“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of",1396
5449,"the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made",1396
5450,him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though,1396
5451,I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest,1396
5452,"thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a",1396
5453,"prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”",1396
5454,“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a,1397
5455,distance of her own family and friends.”,1397
5456,“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”,1398
5457,“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s,1399
5458,"journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”",1399
5459,“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_,1400
5460,"of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins",1400
5461,was settled _near_ her family.”,1400
5462,“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond,1401
5463,"the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”",1401
5464,"As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she",1402
5465,understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and,1402
5466,"Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--",1402
5467,“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her,1403
5468,"family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many",1403
5469,varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of,1403
5470,"travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the",1403
5471,"case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not",1403
5472,such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my,1403
5473,friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_,1403
5474,the present distance.”,1403
5475,"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot",1404
5476,have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have,1404
5477,been always at Longbourn.”,1404
5478,Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of,1405
5479,"feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,",1405
5480,"glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--",1405
5481,“Are you pleased with Kent?”,1406
5482,"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side",1407
5483,calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte,1407
5484,"and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_",1407
5485,surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his,1407
5486,"intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,",1407
5487,"without saying much to anybody, went away.",1407
5488,[Illustration: “Accompanied by their aunt”,1408
5489,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1409
5490,"“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was",1410
5491,"gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never",1410
5492,have called on us in this familiar way.”,1410
5493,"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,",1411
5494,"even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various",1411
5495,"conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from",1411
5496,"the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable",1411
5497,from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there,1411
5498,"was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be",1411
5499,"always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the",1411
5500,"pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the",1411
5501,two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither,1411
5502,"almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes",1411
5503,"separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their",1411
5504,aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he,1411
5505,"had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended",1411
5506,him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in,1411
5507,"being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former",1411
5508,"favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there",1411
5509,"was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she",1411
5510,believed he might have the best informed mind.,1411
5511,But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult,1412
5512,"to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there",1412
5513,"ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it",1412
5514,seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to,1412
5515,"propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really",1412
5516,animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel,1412
5517,Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was,1412
5518,"generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told",1412
5519,her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of,1412
5520,"love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself",1412
5521,seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at,1412
5522,"Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He",1412
5523,"certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that",1412
5524,"look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often",1412
5525,"doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it",1412
5526,seemed nothing but absence of mind.,1412
5527,She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his,1413
5528,"being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.",1413
5529,"Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of",1413
5530,raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her,1413
5531,"opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would",1413
5532,"vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.",1413
5533,"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying",1414
5534,"Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he",1414
5535,"certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,",1414
5536,"to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage",1414
5537,"in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.",1414
5538,[Illustration: “On looking up”],1418
5539,CHAPTER XXXIII.,1422
5540,[Illustration],1424
5541,"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,",1425
5542,unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the,1425
5543,"mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to",1425
5544,"prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,",1425
5545,"that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,",1425
5546,"therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like",1425
5547,"wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was",1425
5548,"not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,",1425
5549,but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He,1425
5550,"never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking",1425
5551,or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third,1425
5552,encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her,1425
5553,"pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her",1425
5554,opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of,1425
5555,"Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to",1425
5556,expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying,1425
5557,_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel,1425
5558,"Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must",1425
5559,mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her,1425
5560,"a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the",1425
5561,pales opposite the Parsonage.,1425
5562,"She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last",1426
5563,"letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not",1426
5564,"written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,",1426
5565,"she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.",1426
5566,"Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--",1426
5567,“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”,1427
5568,"“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally",1428
5569,"do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.",1428
5570,Are you going much farther?”,1428
5571,"“No, I should have turned in a moment.”",1429
5572,"And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage",1430
5573,together.,1430
5574,“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.,1431
5575,“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He,1432
5576,arranges the business just as he pleases.”,1432
5577,"“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least",1433
5578,great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems,1433
5579,more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”,1433
5580,"“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.",1434
5581,“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than,1434
5582,"many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak",1434
5583,"feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and",1434
5584,dependence.”,1434
5585,"“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of",1435
5586,"either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and",1435
5587,dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going,1435
5588,wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”,1435
5589,“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have,1436
5590,experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater,1436
5591,"weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry",1436
5592,where they like.”,1436
5593,"“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often",1437
5594,do.”,1437
5595,"“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in",1438
5596,my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to,1438
5597,money.”,1438
5598,"“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the",1439
5599,"idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is",1439
5600,the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is,1439
5601,"very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”",1439
5602,"He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt",1440
5603,"a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,",1440
5604,"she soon afterwards said,--",1440
5605,“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of,1441
5606,"having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a",1441
5607,"lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well",1441
5608,"for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he",1441
5609,likes with her.”,1441
5610,"“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must",1442
5611,divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”,1442
5612,"“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does",1443
5613,your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes,1443
5614,"a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she",1443
5615,may like to have her own way.”,1443
5616,"As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner",1444
5617,in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to,1444
5618,"give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other",1444
5619,"got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--",1444
5620,“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare,1445
5621,say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a,1445
5622,"very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and",1445
5623,Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”,1445
5624,"“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike",1446
5625,man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”,1446
5626,"“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.",1447
5627,"Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”",1447
5628,"“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in",1448
5629,those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me,1448
5630,"in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted",1448
5631,"to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose",1448
5632,that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”,1448
5633,“What is it you mean?”,1449
5634,“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be,1450
5635,"generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it",1450
5636,would be an unpleasant thing.”,1450
5637,“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”,1451
5638,“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be,1452
5639,Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself,1452
5640,on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most,1452
5641,"imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other",1452
5642,particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him,1452
5643,"the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from",1452
5644,knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”,1452
5645,“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”,1453
5646,“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the,1454
5647,lady.”,1454
5648,“And what arts did he use to separate them?”,1455
5649,"“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He",1456
5650,only told me what I have now told you.”,1456
5651,"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with",1457
5652,"indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she",1457
5653,was so thoughtful.,1457
5654,"“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your",1458
5655,cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the,1458
5656,judge?”,1458
5657,“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”,1459
5658,“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his,1460
5659,"friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to",1460
5660,"determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”",1460
5661,"she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the",1460
5662,"particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed",1460
5663,that there was much affection in the case.”,1460
5664,"“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is",1461
5665,lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”,1461
5666,"This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of",1462
5667,"Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,",1462
5668,"therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent",1462
5669,"matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,",1462
5670,"as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption",1462
5671,of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other,1462
5672,people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There,1462
5673,could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have,1462
5674,such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures,1462
5675,"taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she",1462
5676,had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and,1462
5677,"arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,",1462
5678,_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that,1462
5679,"Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a",1462
5680,"while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart",1462
5681,in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have,1462
5682,inflicted.,1462
5683,"“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel",1463
5684,"Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her",1463
5685,"having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in",1463
5686,business in London.,1463
5687,"“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of",1464
5688,"objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding",1464
5689,"excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could",1464
5690,"anything be urged against my father, who, though with some",1464
5691,"peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,",1464
5692,and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought,1464
5693,"of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would",1464
5694,not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.,1464
5695,"Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from",1464
5696,the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want,1464
5697,"of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly",1464
5698,"governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of",1464
5699,retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.,1464
5700,The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a,1465
5701,"headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to",1465
5702,"her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her",1465
5703,"cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,",1465
5704,"seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much",1465
5705,as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins,1465
5706,could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather,1465
5707,displeased by her staying at home.,1465
5708,[Illustration],1469
5709,CHAPTER XXXIV.,1473
5710,[Illustration],1475
5711,"When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as",1476
5712,"much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the",1476
5713,examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her,1476
5714,"being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any",1476
5715,"revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.",1476
5716,"But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that",1476
5717,"cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,",1476
5718,"proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly",1476
5719,"disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth",1476
5720,"noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an",1476
5721,attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s,1476
5722,shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a,1476
5723,keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to,1476
5724,"think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,",1476
5725,and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be,1476
5726,"with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her",1476
5727,"spirits, by all that affection could do.",1476
5728,She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his,1477
5729,cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear,1477
5730,"that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not",1477
5731,mean to be unhappy about him.,1477
5732,"While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the",1478
5733,door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its,1478
5734,"being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in",1478
5735,"the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But",1478
5736,"this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently",1478
5737,"affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the",1478
5738,room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her,1478
5739,"health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.",1478
5740,"She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and",1478
5741,"then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but",1478
5742,"said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her",1478
5743,"in an agitated manner, and thus began:--",1478
5744,“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be,1479
5745,repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love,1479
5746,you.”,1479
5747,"Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,",1480
5748,"doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,",1480
5749,and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately,1480
5750,followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the,1480
5751,"heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of",1480
5752,"tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a",1480
5753,"degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed",1480
5754,"to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the",1480
5755,"consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his",1480
5756,suit.,1480
5757,"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to",1481
5758,"the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did",1481
5759,"not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to",1481
5760,"receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost",1481
5761,"all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to",1481
5762,"answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with",1481
5763,representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of,1481
5764,all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with,1481
5765,expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of,1481
5766,his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a,1481
5767,"favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his",1481
5768,countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only,1481
5769,exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks,1481
5770,"and she said,--",1481
5771,"“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to",1482
5772,"express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however",1482
5773,unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be,1482
5774,"felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I",1482
5775,"cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly",1482
5776,bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to,1482
5777,"anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be",1482
5778,of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented,1482
5779,the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in,1482
5780,overcoming it after this explanation.”,1482
5781,"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed",1483
5782,"on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than",1483
5783,"surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of",1483
5784,his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the,1483
5785,"appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed",1483
5786,himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings,1483
5787,"dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--",1483
5788,“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I,1484
5789,"might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at",1484
5790,"civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”",1484
5791,"“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design",1485
5792,"of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me",1485
5793,"against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?",1485
5794,"Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have",1485
5795,other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided,1485
5796,"against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been",1485
5797,"favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept",1485
5798,"the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the",1485
5799,happiness of a most beloved sister?”,1485
5800,"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion",1486
5801,"was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she",1486
5802,"continued,--",1486
5803,“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can,1487
5804,"excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,",1487
5805,"you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means",1487
5806,"of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the",1487
5807,"world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for",1487
5808,"disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest",1487
5809,kind.”,1487
5810,"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening",1488
5811,with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.,1488
5812,He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.,1488
5813,“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.,1489
5814,"With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying",1490
5815,that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your,1490
5816,"sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been",1490
5817,kinder than towards myself.”,1490
5818,"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,",1491
5819,"but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.",1491
5820,"“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike",1492
5821,"is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was",1492
5822,decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received,1492
5823,"many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to",1492
5824,say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?,1492
5825,or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”,1492
5826,"“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,",1493
5827,"in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.",1493
5828,“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an,1494
5829,interest in him?”,1494
5830,"“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his",1495
5831,misfortunes have been great indeed.”,1495
5832,"“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have",1496
5833,reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You,1496
5834,have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed,1496
5835,for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that,1496
5836,independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done,1496
5837,all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with,1496
5838,contempt and ridicule.”,1496
5839,"“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,",1497
5840,“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I,1497
5841,"thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this",1497
5842,"calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his",1497
5843,"walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been",1497
5844,"overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the",1497
5845,scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These,1497
5846,"bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater",1497
5847,"policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my",1497
5848,"being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by",1497
5849,"reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.",1497
5850,Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.,1497
5851,Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your,1497
5852,connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose,1497
5853,condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”,1497
5854,Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to,1498
5855,"the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--",1498
5856,"“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your",1499
5857,declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the,1499
5858,"concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a",1499
5859,more gentlemanlike manner.”,1499
5860,"She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--",1500
5861,“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way,1501
5862,that would have tempted me to accept it.”,1501
5863,Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an,1502
5864,"expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--",1502
5865,"“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my",1503
5866,"acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest",1503
5867,"belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the",1503
5868,"feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of",1503
5869,"disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a",1503
5870,dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the,1503
5871,last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”,1503
5872,"“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your",1504
5873,"feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.",1504
5874,"Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best",1504
5875,wishes for your health and happiness.”,1504
5876,"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him",1505
5877,the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of,1505
5878,"her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,",1505
5879,"and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her",1505
5880,"astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by",1505
5881,every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from,1505
5882,Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!,1505
5883,so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections,1505
5884,"which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which",1505
5885,"must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost",1505
5886,incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong,1505
5887,"an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal",1505
5888,"of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in",1505
5889,"acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner",1505
5890,"which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not",1505
5891,"attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his",1505
5892,attachment had for a moment excited.,1505
5893,She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady,1506
5894,Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter,1506
5895,"Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.",1506
5896,[Illustration:,1510
5897,“Hearing herself called”,1511
5898,],1511
5899,CHAPTER XXXV.,1515
5900,[Illustration],1517
5901,Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations,1518
5902,which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the,1518
5903,surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything,1518
5904,"else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after",1518
5905,breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding,1518
5906,"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s",1518
5907,"sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,",1518
5908,she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The,1518
5909,"park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one",1518
5910,of the gates into the ground.,1518
5911,"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was",1519
5912,"tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and",1519
5913,look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had,1519
5914,"made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the",1519
5915,verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her,1519
5916,"walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove",1519
5917,which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being,1519
5918,"Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was",1519
5919,"now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,",1519
5920,"pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,",1519
5921,"though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again",1519
5922,"towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out",1519
5923,"a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty",1519
5924,"composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of",1519
5925,meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and,1519
5926,"then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon",1519
5927,out of sight.,1519
5928,"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,",1520
5929,"Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,",1520
5930,"perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written",1520
5931,"quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise",1520
5932,"full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated",1520
5933,"from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--",1520
5934,"“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of",1521
5935,"its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those",1521
5936,"offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any",1521
5937,"intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,",1521
5938,"which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the",1521
5939,"effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,",1521
5940,"should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written",1521
5941,"and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand",1521
5942,"your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I",1521
5943,demand it of your justice.,1521
5944,"“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal",1522
5945,"magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,",1522
5946,"that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley",1522
5947,"from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various",1522
5948,"claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate",1522
5949,prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and,1522
5950,"wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged",1522
5951,"favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other",1522
5952,"dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect",1522
5953,"its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young",1522
5954,"persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could",1522
5955,bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last,1522
5956,"night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope",1522
5957,"to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and",1522
5958,"their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due",1522
5959,"to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be",1522
5960,"offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must",1522
5961,"be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in",1522
5962,"Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley",1522
5963,preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But,1522
5964,it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any,1522
5965,apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him,1522
5966,"in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with",1522
5967,"you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental",1522
5968,"information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to",1522
5969,a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain,1522
5970,"event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I",1522
5971,observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive,1522
5972,that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed,1522
5973,"in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,",1522
5974,"cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar",1522
5975,"regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that",1522
5976,"though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite",1522
5977,them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken,1522
5978,"here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your",1522
5979,"sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled",1522
5980,"by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been",1522
5981,"unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of",1522
5982,your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most,1522
5983,"acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart",1522
5984,was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing,1522
5985,her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my,1522
5986,investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or,1522
5987,fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I,1522
5988,"believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.",1522
5989,My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night,1522
5990,acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside,1522
5991,in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to,1522
5992,my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes,1522
5993,"which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both",1522
5994,"instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not",1522
5995,"immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The",1522
5996,"situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in",1522
5997,"comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost",1522
5998,"uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and",1522
5999,"occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend",1522
6000,"you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,",1522
6001,"and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you",1522
6002,consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid,1522
6003,any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on,1522
6004,you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and,1522
6005,"disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed",1522
6006,"that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every",1522
6007,"inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my",1522
6008,friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left,1522
6009,"Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,",1522
6010,"remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is",1522
6011,now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited,1522
6012,"with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike",1522
6013,"sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we",1522
6014,shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly,1522
6015,went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my,1522
6016,friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them,1522
6017,earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed,1522
6018,"his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have",1522
6019,"prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which",1522
6020,"I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before",1522
6021,"believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,",1522
6022,"regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger",1522
6023,"dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,",1522
6024,that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade,1522
6025,"him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been",1522
6026,"given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for",1522
6027,"having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole",1522
6028,"affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I",1522
6029,condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him,1522
6030,"your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss",1522
6031,Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might,1522
6032,"have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard",1522
6033,did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some,1522
6034,"danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is",1522
6035,"done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have",1522
6036,"nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your",1522
6037,"sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which",1522
6038,"governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not",1522
6039,"yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty",1522
6040,"accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by",1522
6041,laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he,1522
6042,has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I,1522
6043,shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.,1522
6044,"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years",1522
6045,"the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in",1522
6046,the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service,1522
6047,"to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was",1522
6048,"therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and",1522
6049,"afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,",1522
6050,"always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to",1522
6051,give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this,1522
6052,"young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the",1522
6053,"highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,",1522
6054,"intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years",1522
6055,since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The,1522
6056,"vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to",1522
6057,"guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the",1522
6058,"observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who",1522
6059,"had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy",1522
6060,could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you,1522
6061,only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has,1522
6062,"created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding",1522
6063,his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father,1522
6064,died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the,1522
6065,"last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to",1522
6066,promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might,1522
6067,"allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living",1522
6068,might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of,1522
6069,one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and,1522
6070,within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me,1522
6071,"that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should",1522
6072,not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate,1522
6073,"pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be",1522
6074,"benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I",1522
6075,must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very,1522
6076,insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be,1522
6077,"sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his",1522
6078,proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The,1522
6079,business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance,1522
6080,"in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to",1522
6081,"receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection",1522
6082,between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him,1522
6083,"to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he",1522
6084,"chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being",1522
6085,"now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and",1522
6086,dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the,1522
6087,"decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,",1522
6088,he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His,1522
6089,"circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,",1522
6090,"were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,",1522
6091,"and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present",1522
6092,him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little,1522
6093,"doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,",1522
6094,and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will,1522
6095,"hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for",1522
6096,resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to,1522
6097,the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in,1522
6098,his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this,1522
6099,"period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I",1522
6100,know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my,1522
6101,notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget,1522
6102,"myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me",1522
6103,"to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of",1522
6104,"your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left",1522
6105,"to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and",1522
6106,"myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an",1522
6107,establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with,1522
6108,the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.,1522
6109,"Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior",1522
6110,"acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were",1522
6111,most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far,1522
6112,"recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a",1522
6113,"strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was",1522
6114,persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She,1522
6115,"was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her",1522
6116,"imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to",1522
6117,herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended,1522
6118,"elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving",1522
6119,"and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,",1522
6120,acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I,1522
6121,acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public,1522
6122,"exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,",1522
6123,and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s,1522
6124,"chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty",1522
6125,thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging,1522
6126,himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been,1522
6127,"complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in",1522
6128,which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely,1522
6129,"reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty",1522
6130,"towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of",1522
6131,"falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be",1522
6132,"wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning",1522
6133,"either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly",1522
6134,not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not,1522
6135,told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know,1522
6136,what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here,1522
6137,"related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel",1522
6138,"Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and",1522
6139,"still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been",1522
6140,unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If,1522
6141,"your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you",1522
6142,cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and,1522
6143,"that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour",1522
6144,to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the,1522
6145,"course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.",1522
6146,“FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”,1523
6147,[Illustration],1527
6148,CHAPTER XXXVI.,1531
6149,[Illustration],1533
6150,"Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to",1534
6151,"contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of",1534
6152,"its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly",1534
6153,"she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.",1534
6154,Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did,1534
6155,she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;,1534
6156,"and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to",1534
6157,"give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong",1534
6158,"prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of",1534
6159,what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which,1534
6160,hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing,1534
6161,"what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the",1534
6162,sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s,1534
6163,insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the,1534
6164,"real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any",1534
6165,wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done,1534
6166,"which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all",1534
6167,pride and insolence.,1534
6168,But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when,1535
6169,"she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,",1535
6170,"if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which",1535
6171,bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings,1535
6172,were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.,1535
6173,"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished",1535
6174,"to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!",1535
6175,This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had,1535
6176,"gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the",1535
6177,"last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not",1535
6178,"regard it, that she would never look in it again.",1535
6179,"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on",1536
6180,"nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter",1536
6181,"was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she",1536
6182,"again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and",1536
6183,commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.,1536
6184,The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly,1536
6185,"what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,",1536
6186,"though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his",1536
6187,own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to,1536
6188,"the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living",1536
6189,"was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was",1536
6190,impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the,1536
6191,"other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did",1536
6192,"not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the",1536
6193,particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions,1536
6194,"to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three",1536
6195,"thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the",1536
6196,"letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be",1536
6197,impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with,1536
6198,little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.,1536
6199,"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had",1536
6200,believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to,1536
6201,"render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a",1536
6202,turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.,1536
6203,The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to,1537
6204,"Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could",1537
6205,bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his,1537
6206,"entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the",1537
6207,"persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,",1537
6208,"had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,",1537
6209,nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told,1537
6210,[Illustration:,1538
6211,     “Meeting accidentally in Town”,1539
6212,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1540
6213,"himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,",1541
6214,"she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and",1541
6215,"manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.",1541
6216,"She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished",1541
6217,"trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the",1541
6218,"attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone",1541
6219,"for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what",1541
6220,Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’,1541
6221,continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him,1541
6222,"instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could",1541
6223,remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the,1541
6224,"neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in",1541
6225,"the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once",1541
6226,"more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his",1541
6227,"designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed",1541
6228,between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at,1541
6229,last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel,1541
6230,Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the,1541
6231,information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose,1541
6232,character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost,1541
6233,"resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness",1541
6234,"of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that",1541
6235,"Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been",1541
6236,well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.,1541
6237,She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation,1542
6238,between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.,1542
6239,Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_,1542
6240,"struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and",1542
6241,wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting,1542
6242,"himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions",1542
6243,with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear,1542
6244,"of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that",1542
6245,_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball,1542
6246,"the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield",1542
6247,"family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but",1542
6248,"herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;",1542
6249,"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s",1542
6250,"character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would",1542
6251,always prevent his exposing the son.,1542
6252,How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His,1543
6253,attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and,1543
6254,hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer,1543
6255,"the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.",1543
6256,His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had,1543
6257,"either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying",1543
6258,his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most,1543
6259,incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter,1543
6260,"and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not",1543
6261,"but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago",1543
6262,"asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as",1543
6263,"were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their",1543
6264,acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much,1543
6265,"together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything",1543
6266,that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him,1543
6267,of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was,1543
6268,esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a,1543
6269,"brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his",1543
6270,sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his,1543
6271,"actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of",1543
6272,everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and,1543
6273,that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man,1543
6274,as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.,1543
6275,She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham,1544
6276,"could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,",1544
6277,"prejudiced, absurd.",1544
6278,"“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on",1545
6279,"my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have",1545
6280,"often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my",1545
6281,vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this,1545
6282,"discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not",1545
6283,"have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my",1545
6284,"folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect",1545
6285,"of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted",1545
6286,"prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were",1545
6287,"concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”",1545
6288,"From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line",1546
6289,which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation,1546
6290,_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely,1546
6291,different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that,1546
6292,"credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to",1546
6293,give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious,1546
6294,of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what,1546
6295,Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice,1546
6296,"of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though",1546
6297,"fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant",1546
6298,"complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great",1546
6299,sensibility.,1546
6300,When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were,1547
6301,"mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense",1547
6302,of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly,1547
6303,"for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as",1547
6304,"having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first",1547
6305,"disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind",1547
6306,than on hers.,1547
6307,"The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but",1548
6308,it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus,1548
6309,self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that,1548
6310,"Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest",1548
6311,"relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt",1548
6312,"by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she",1548
6313,had ever known before.,1548
6314,"After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every",1549
6315,"variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and",1549
6316,"reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so",1549
6317,"important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at",1549
6318,length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing,1549
6319,"cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as",1549
6320,must make her unfit for conversation.,1549
6321,"She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each",1550
6322,"called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take",1550
6323,"leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least",1550
6324,"an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her",1550
6325,till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in,1550
6326,missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no,1550
6327,longer an object. She could think only of her letter.,1550
6328,[Illustration:,1554
6329,“His parting obeisance”,1555
6330,],1555
6331,CHAPTER XXXVII.,1559
6332,[Illustration],1561
6333,The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having,1562
6334,"been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was",1562
6335,able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very,1562
6336,"good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the",1562
6337,melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then,1562
6338,hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return,1562
6339,"brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,",1562
6340,importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of,1562
6341,having them all to dine with her.,1562
6342,"Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had",1563
6343,"she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her",1563
6344,"future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her",1563
6345,Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how,1563
6346,would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused,1563
6347,herself.,1563
6348,Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure,1564
6349,"you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody",1564
6350,feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly,1564
6351,attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!,1564
6352,They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear,1564
6353,Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy,1564
6354,"seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His",1564
6355,attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”,1564
6356,"Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which",1565
6357,were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.,1565
6358,"Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of",1566
6359,"spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that",1566
6360,"she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--",1566
6361,"“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you",1567
6362,may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your,1567
6363,"company, I am sure.”",1567
6364,"“I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied",1568
6365,Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town,1568
6366,next Saturday.”,1568
6367,"“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected",1569
6368,you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There,1569
6369,can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly,1569
6370,spare you for another fortnight.”,1569
6371,“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”,1570

6375,"“Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.",1574
6376,Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will,1574
6377,"stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you",1574
6378,"as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and",1574
6379,"as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good",1574
6380,"room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be",1574
6381,"cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you",1574
6382,large.”,1574
6383,"“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our",1575
6384,original plan.”,1575
6385,"Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant",1576
6386,"with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea",1576
6387,of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.,1576
6388,You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the,1576
6389,world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly,1576
6390,"guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my",1576
6391,"niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her",1576
6392,"having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.",1576
6393,"Darcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with",1576
6394,propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those,1576
6395,"things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am",1576
6396,glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be,1576
6397,discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”,1576
6398,“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”,1577
6399,"“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you",1578
6400,have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?,1578
6401,"Oh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be",1578
6402,attended to.”,1578
6403,Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;,1579
6404,and as she did not answer them all herself attention was,1579
6405,"necessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a",1579
6406,"mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection",1579
6407,"must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave",1579
6408,way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a,1579
6409,"solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of",1579
6410,unpleasant recollections.,1579
6411,Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She,1580
6412,studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at,1580
6413,"times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,",1580
6414,she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly,1580
6415,"she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against",1580
6416,herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.,1580
6417,"His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she",1580
6418,"could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or",1580
6419,feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past,1580
6420,"behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in",1580
6421,"the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.",1580
6422,"They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at",1580
6423,"them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his",1580
6424,"youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right",1580
6425,"herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently",1580
6426,united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine,1580
6427,"and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,",1580
6428,"what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,",1580
6429,"irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always",1580
6430,"affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would",1580
6431,"scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While",1580
6432,"there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while",1580
6433,"Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for",1580
6434,ever.,1580
6435,Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s,1581
6436,"explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,",1581
6437,heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to,1581
6438,"have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any",1581
6439,could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How,1581
6440,"grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every",1581
6441,"respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had",1581
6442,"been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!",1581
6443,When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s,1582
6444,"character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had",1582
6445,seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it,1582
6446,almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.,1582
6447,Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of,1583
6448,her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent,1583
6449,there; and her Ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of,1583
6450,"their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,",1583
6451,and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right,1583
6452,"way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the",1583
6453,"work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.",1583
6454,"When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them",1584
6455,"a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;",1584
6456,and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out,1584
6457,her hand to both.,1584

6462,[Illustration],1595
6463,On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few,1596
6464,minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of,1596
6465,paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.,1596
6466,"“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet",1597
6467,expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very,1597
6468,certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for,1597
6469,"it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know",1597
6470,how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain,1597
6471,"manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we",1597
6472,"see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like",1597
6473,"yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,",1597
6474,and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending,1597
6475,your time unpleasantly.”,1597
6476,Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had,1598
6477,spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with,1598
6478,"Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel",1598
6479,the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling,1598
6480,"solemnity replied,--",1598
6481,“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your,1599
6482,time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most,1599
6483,fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior,1599
6484,"society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of",1599
6485,"varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that",1599
6486,your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation,1599
6487,"with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of",1599
6488,extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on,1599
6489,what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In,1599
6490,"truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this",1599
6491,"humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of",1599
6492,"compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”",1599
6493,Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was,1600
6494,"obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility",1600
6495,and truth in a few short sentences.,1600
6496,"“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into",1601
6497,"Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will",1601
6498,be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you,1601
6499,have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear,1601
6500,that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be,1601
6501,"as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,",1601
6502,that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in,1601
6503,marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of,1601
6504,thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of,1601
6505,character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each,1601
6506,other.”,1601
6507,Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was,1602
6508,"the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed",1602
6509,"and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to",1602
6510,have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from,1602
6511,whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such,1602
6512,society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently,1602
6513,"regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for",1602
6514,"compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,",1602
6515,"and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.",1602
6516,"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels",1603
6517,"placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate",1603
6518,"parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by",1603
6519,"Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning",1603
6520,"her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks",1603
6521,"for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his",1603
6522,"compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed",1603
6523,"her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,",1603
6524,"when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had",1603
6525,hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.,1603
6526,[Illustration:,1604
6527,“They had forgotten to leave any message”,1605
6528,],1605
6529,"“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects",1606
6530,"delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you",1606
6531,while you have been here.”,1606
6532,"Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and",1607
6533,the carriage drove off.,1607
6534,"“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems",1608
6535,but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have,1608
6536,happened!”,1608
6537,"“A great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.",1609
6538,"“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!",1610
6539,How much I shall have to tell!”,1610
6540,"Elizabeth privately added, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”",1611
6541,"Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and",1612
6542,within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s,1612
6543,"house, where they were to remain a few days.",1612
6544,"Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her",1613
6545,"spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt",1613
6546,"had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at",1613
6547,Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.,1613
6548,"It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for",1614
6549,"Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know",1614
6550,that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish,1614
6551,"Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own",1614
6552,"vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation",1614
6553,"to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision",1614
6554,"in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,",1614
6555,"and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into",1614
6556,"repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister",1614

6563,"It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out",1626
6564,"together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;",1626
6565,"and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was",1626
6566,"to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s",1626
6567,"punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.",1626
6568,"These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed",1626
6569,"in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and",1626
6570,dressing a salad and cucumber.,1626
6571,"After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set",1627
6572,"out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,",1627
6573,“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”,1627
6574,"“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the",1628
6575,"money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing",1628
6576,"her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it",1628
6577,is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall,1628
6578,"pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any",1628
6579,better.”,1628
6580,"And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect",1629
6581,"unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and",1629
6582,"when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I",1629
6583,"think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what",1629
6584,"one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they",1629
6585,are going in a fortnight.”,1629
6586,"“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.",1630
6587,“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to,1631
6588,"take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,",1631
6589,and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to,1631
6590,"go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall",1631
6591,have!”,1631
6592,"“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,",1632
6593,and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole,1632
6594,"campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor",1632
6595,"regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”",1632
6596,"“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to",1633

6598,a certain person that we all like.”,1633
6599,"Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he",1634
6600,"need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--",1634
6601,"“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the",1635
6602,"waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse",1635
6603,things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad,1635
6604,"he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for",1635
6605,"my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?",1635
6606,There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She,1635
6607,is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”,1635
6608,“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection,1636
6609,imprudent as to fortune.”,1636
6610,"“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”",1637

6615,"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such",1640

6619,"As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was",1641
6620,"ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their",1641
6621,"boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and",1641
6622,"Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.",1641
6623,“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my,1642
6624,"bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now",1642
6625,"let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way",1642
6626,"home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all",1642
6627,since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any,1642
6628,flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband,1642
6629,"before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.",1642
6630,She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not,1642
6631,being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to,1642
6632,get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.,1642
6633,Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!,1642
6634,how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would,1642
6635,_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece,1642
6636,of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend,1642
6637,"the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the",1642
6638,"evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so",1642
6639,"she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen",1642
6640,"was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We",1642
6641,"dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a",1642
6642,"lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.",1642
6643,"Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow",1642
6644,"one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,",1642
6645,"and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they",1642
6646,did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.,1642
6647,Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect,1642
6648,"something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”",1642
6649,"With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,",1643
6650,"assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her",1643
6651,companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she,1643
6652,"could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.",1643
6653,Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane,1644
6654,in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet,1644

6656,"“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”",1645
6657,"Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases",1646
6658,came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects,1646
6659,"which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the",1646
6660,"table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet",1646
6661,"was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present",1646
6662,"fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,",1646
6663,"retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice",1646
6664,"rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various",1646
6665,pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.,1646
6666,"“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!",1647
6667,"as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended",1647
6668,"there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if",1647
6669,"Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we",1647
6670,"behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest",1647
6671,"cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have",1647
6672,treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought,1647
6673,we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.,1647
6674,And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so,1647
6675,"loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”",1647
6676,"To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,",1648
6677,to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the,1648
6678,generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for,1648
6679,_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”,1648
6680,But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to,1649
6681,"anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.",1649
6682,In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to,1650
6683,"Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed",1650
6684,"the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at",1650
6685,home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was,1650
6686,"another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham",1650
6687,"again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to",1650
6688,"_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond",1650
6689,"expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped",1650
6690,there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.,1650
6691,"She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton",1651
6692,"scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under",1651
6693,frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her,1651
6694,father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were,1651
6695,"at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often",1651
6696,"disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.",1651
6697,[Illustration],1655
6698,CHAPTER XL.,1659
6699,[Illustration],1661
6700,Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no,1662
6701,longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular,1662
6702,"in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,",1662
6703,she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.,1662
6704,Darcy and herself.,1662
6705,Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly,1663
6706,partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly,1663
6707,natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was,1663
6708,sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so,1663
6709,little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the,1663
6710,unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.,1663
6711,"“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly",1664
6712,ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his,1664
6713,disappointment.”,1664
6714,"“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has",1665
6715,other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.,1665
6716,"You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”",1665
6717,"“Blame you! Oh, no.”",1666
6718,“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”,1667
6719,“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”,1668
6720,"“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very",1669
6721,next day.”,1669
6722,"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far",1670
6723,"as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,",1670
6724,who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that,1670
6725,so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here,1670
6726,"collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though",1670
6727,"grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.",1670
6728,"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and",1670
6729,"seek to clear one, without involving the other.",1670
6730,"“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both",1671
6731,"of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied",1671
6732,with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just,1671
6733,enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting,1671
6734,"about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.",1671
6735,"Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”",1671
6736,"It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.",1672
6737,"“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so",1673
6738,"very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,",1673
6739,only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and,1673
6740,with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a,1673
6741,"thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must",1673
6742,feel it so.”,1673
6743,"“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full",1674
6744,"of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing",1674
6745,every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me,1674
6746,"saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as",1674
6747,light as a feather.”,1674
6748,“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his,1675
6749,countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”,1675
6750,“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those,1676
6751,"two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the",1676
6752,appearance of it.”,1676
6753,“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you,1677
6754,used to do.”,1677
6755,“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike,1678
6756,"to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an",1678
6757,"opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually",1678
6758,abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing,1678
6759,at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”,1678
6760,"“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat",1679
6761,the matter as you do now.”,1679
6762,"“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very",1680
6763,uncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I,1680
6764,"felt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,",1680
6765,"and vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!”",1680
6766,“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions,1681
6767,"in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly",1681
6768,undeserved.”,1681
6769,“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most,1682
6770,natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is,1682
6771,one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I,1682
6772,"ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand",1682
6773,Wickham’s character.”,1682
6774,"Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no",1683
6775,occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?”,1683
6776,“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to,1684
6777,"make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular",1684
6778,relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to,1684
6779,myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his,1684
6780,"conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is",1684
6781,"so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in",1684
6782,"Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to",1684
6783,"it. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to",1684
6784,anybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found,1684
6785,"out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.",1684
6786,At present I will say nothing about it.”,1684
6787,“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for,1685
6788,"ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to",1685
6789,re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”,1685
6790,The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She,1686
6791,had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a,1686
6792,"fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she",1686
6793,might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something,1686
6794,"lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not",1686
6795,"relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister",1686
6796,how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in,1686
6797,which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than,1686
6798,a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in,1686
6799,"throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if",1686
6800,"that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be",1686
6801,able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner,1686
6802,himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost,1686
6803,all its value!”,1686
6804,"She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real",1687
6805,state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a,1687
6806,very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in,1687
6807,"love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from",1687
6808,"her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often",1687
6809,"boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to",1687
6810,"every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the",1687
6811,"feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those",1687
6812,regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their,1687
6813,tranquillity.,1687
6814,"“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of",1688
6815,"this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak",1688
6816,of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I,1688
6817,"cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a",1688
6818,very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there is the least,1688
6819,chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his,1688
6820,coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of,1688
6821,"everybody, too, who is likely to know.”",1688
6822,[Illustration:,1689
6823,     “I am determined never to speak of it again”,1690
6824,],1690
6825,“I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”,1691
6826,"“Oh, well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come; though I",1692
6827,"shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if I was",1692
6828,"her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure",1692
6829,"Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he",1692
6830,has done.”,1692
6831,But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she,1693
6832,made no answer.,1693
6833,"“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the",1694
6834,"Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it",1694
6835,will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an,1694
6836,"excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother,",1694
6837,she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_,1694
6838,"housekeeping, I dare say.”",1694
6839,"“No, nothing at all.”",1695
6840,"“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _They_ will",1696
6841,take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed,1696
6842,"for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often",1696
6843,talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it,1696
6844,"quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”",1696
6845,“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”,1697
6846,“No; it would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt they,1698
6847,"often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an",1698
6848,"estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _I_ should be",1698
6849,ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”,1698

6853,CHAPTER XLI.,1708
6854,[Illustration],1710
6855,The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was,1711
6856,"the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in",1711
6857,the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost,1711
6858,"universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,",1711
6859,"and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very",1711
6860,frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and,1711
6861,"Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such",1711
6862,hard-heartedness in any of the family.,1711
6863,“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they,1712
6864,"often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,",1712
6865,Lizzy?”,1712
6866,Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what,1713
6867,she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.,1713
6868,"“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel",1714
6869,Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”,1714
6870,"“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.",1715
6871,“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.,1716
6872,“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”,1717
6873,“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”,1718
6874,"“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”",1719
6875,added Kitty.,1719
6876,Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through,1720
6877,Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense,1720
6878,of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s,1720
6879,objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his,1720
6880,interference in the views of his friend.,1720
6881,But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she,1721
6882,"received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the",1721
6883,"regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a",1721
6884,"very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour",1721
6885,"and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of",1721
6886,their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.,1721
6887,"The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,",1722
6888,"the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely",1722
6889,"to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew",1722
6890,"about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s",1722
6891,"congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;",1722
6892,whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate,1722
6893,in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.,1722
6894,"“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”",1723
6895,"said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much",1723
6896,"right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”",1723
6897,"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make",1724
6898,"her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from",1724
6899,"exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she",1724
6900,considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense,1724
6901,"for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it",1724
6902,"known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her",1724
6903,go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general,1724
6904,"behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of",1724
6905,"such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more",1724
6906,"imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must",1724
6907,"be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--",1724
6908,“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public,1725
6909,"place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little",1725
6910,expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present,1725
6911,circumstances.”,1725
6912,"“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to",1726
6913,"us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and",1726
6914,"imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you",1726
6915,would judge differently in the affair.”,1726
6916,“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away,1727
6917,some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such,1727
6918,squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity,1727
6919,"are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows",1727
6920,who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”,1727
6921,"“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not",1728
6922,"of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our",1728
6923,"importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the",1728
6924,"wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark",1728
6925,"Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear",1728
6926,"father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and",1728
6927,of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of,1728
6928,"her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character",1728
6929,"will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt",1728
6930,"that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the",1728
6931,worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond,1728
6932,"youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of",1728
6933,"her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal",1728
6934,contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty,1728
6935,"is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,",1728
6936,"ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you",1728
6937,suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever,1728
6938,"they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the",1728
6939,disgrace?”,1728
6940,"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,",1729
6941,"affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--",1729
6942,"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,",1730
6943,you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less,1730
6944,"advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly",1730
6945,sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to,1730
6946,"Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will",1730
6947,keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an,1730
6948,object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance,1730
6949,even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find,1730
6950,"women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being",1730
6951,"there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow",1730
6952,"many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest",1730
6953,of her life.”,1730
6954,With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion,1731
6955,"continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not",1731
6956,"in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.",1731
6957,She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over,1731
6958,"unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her",1731
6959,disposition.,1731
6960,Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her,1732
6961,"father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their",1732
6962,"united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised",1732
6963,"every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye",1732
6964,"of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.",1732
6965,She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at,1732
6966,present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents,1732
6967,"stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young",1732
6968,"and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she",1732
6969,"saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six",1732
6970,officers at once.,1732
6971,[Illustration:,1733
6972,“Tenderly flirting”,1734
6973,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1735
6974,Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and,1736
6975,"such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could",1736
6976,"have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the",1736
6977,same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the,1736
6978,melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there,1736
6979,himself.,1736
6980,But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures,1737
6981,"continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving",1737
6982,home.,1737
6983,Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been,1738
6984,"frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty",1738
6985,well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even,1738
6986,"learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,",1738
6987,an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present,1738
6988,"behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;",1738
6989,for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which,1738
6990,"had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after",1738
6991,"what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in",1738
6992,finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous,1738
6993,"gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the",1738
6994,"reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever",1738
6995,"cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,",1738
6996,"and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.",1738
6997,"On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,",1739
6998,"with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth",1739
6999,"disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some",1739
7000,"inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she",1739
7001,mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three,1739
7002,"weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.",1739
7003,"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s",1740
7004,"recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen",1740
7005,"him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,",1740
7006,asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.,1740
7007,"With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you",1740
7008,say that he was at Rosings?”,1740
7009,“Nearly three weeks.”,1741
7010,“And you saw him frequently?”,1742
7011,"“Yes, almost every day.”",1743
7012,“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”,1744
7013,"“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”",1745
7014,"“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray",1746
7015,"may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in",1746
7016,address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his,1746
7017,"ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more",1746
7018,"serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”",1746
7019,"“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much",1747
7020,what he ever was.”,1747
7021,"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to",1748
7022,rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a,1748
7023,something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive,1748
7024,"and anxious attention, while she added,--",1748
7025,"“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that",1749
7026,"either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,",1749
7027,"from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”",1749
7028,Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated,1750
7029,"look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his",1750
7030,"embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of",1750
7031,"accents,--",1750
7032,"“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily",1751
7033,comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume,1751
7034,"even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,",1751
7035,"may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter",1751
7036,him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that,1751
7037,"the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is",1751
7038,"merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and",1751
7039,"judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I",1751
7040,"know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his",1751
7041,"wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he",1751
7042,has very much at heart.”,1751
7043,"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a",1752
7044,slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on,1752
7045,"the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge",1752
7046,"him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,",1752
7047,"of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish",1752
7048,"Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a",1752
7049,mutual desire of never meeting again.,1752
7050,"When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,",1753
7051,from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation,1753
7052,between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the,1753
7053,only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.,1753
7054,"Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,",1753
7055,and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the,1753
7056,"opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there",1753
7057,"was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous",1753
7058,"happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus",1753
7059,of her sisters were uttered without being heard.,1753

7065,[Illustration],1764
7066,"Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could",1765
7067,not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic,1765
7068,"comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance",1765
7069,"of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a",1765
7070,woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in,1765
7071,"their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,",1765
7072,"esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of",1765
7073,domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a,1765
7074,disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own,1765
7075,imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often,1765
7076,console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of,1765
7077,the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal,1765
7078,enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as,1765
7079,her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not,1765
7080,the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his,1765
7081,"wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true",1765
7082,philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.,1765
7083,"Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her",1766
7084,father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but,1766
7085,"respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of",1766
7086,"herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to",1766
7087,banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation,1766
7088,"and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own",1766
7089,"children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so",1766
7090,strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so,1766
7091,"unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising",1766
7092,"from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,",1766
7093,"might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even",1766
7094,if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.,1766
7095,"When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure, she found little",1767
7096,other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties,1767
7097,abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and,1767
7098,"sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around",1767
7099,"them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty",1767
7100,"might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers",1767
7101,"of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition",1767
7102,"greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her",1767
7103,"folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a",1767
7104,"watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what",1767
7105,"has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked",1767
7106,"forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the",1767
7107,satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to,1767
7108,name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have,1767
7109,"some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by",1767
7110,"again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the",1767
7111,"present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes",1767
7112,was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation,1767
7113,for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother,1767
7114,and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the,1767
7115,"scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.",1767
7116,"“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.",1768
7117,"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.",1768
7118,"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my",1768
7119,"sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of",1768
7120,pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can,1768
7121,never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by,1768
7122,the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”,1768
7123,When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely,1769
7124,"to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and",1769
7125,always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that,1769
7126,"they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers",1769
7127,"had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as",1769
7128,"made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which",1769
7129,"she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a",1769
7130,"violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the",1769
7131,camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less,1769
7132,"to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much",1769
7133,too full of lines under the words to be made public.,1769
7134,"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,",1770
7135,"good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything",1770
7136,wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter,1770
7137,"came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.",1770
7138,Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle,1770
7139,of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton,1770
7140,"without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth",1770
7141,"hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably",1770
7142,"reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by",1770
7143,"some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment",1770
7144,should be quartered in Meryton.,1770
7145,The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast,1771
7146,"approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter",1771
7147,"arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and",1771
7148,curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from,1771
7149,"setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again",1771
7150,within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so,1771
7151,"far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with",1771
7152,"the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up",1771
7153,"the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the",1771
7154,"present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that",1771
7155,county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three,1771
7156,weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The,1771
7157,"town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where",1771
7158,"they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of",1771
7159,"her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,",1771
7160,"Dovedale, or the Peak.",1771
7161,Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing,1772
7162,the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it,1772
7163,was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;,1772
7164,and all was soon right again.,1772
7165,"With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was",1773
7166,impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its,1773
7167,"owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,",1773
7168,"and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”",1773
7169,The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away,1774
7170,"before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and",1774
7171,"Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at",1774
7172,"Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two",1774
7173,"younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin",1774
7174,"Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and",1774
7175,sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every,1774
7176,"way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.",1774
7177,"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next",1775
7178,morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One,1775
7179,enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a,1775
7180,suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear,1775
7181,inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection,1775
7182,"and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were",1775
7183,disappointments abroad.,1775
7184,"It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,",1776
7185,nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither,1776
7186,"lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are",1776
7187,sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present,1776
7188,"concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s",1776
7189,"former residence, and where she had lately learned that some",1776
7190,"acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen",1776
7191,all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of,1776
7192,"Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It",1776
7193,was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In,1776
7194,"talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an",1776
7195,inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his,1776
7196,"willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.",1776
7197,"“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so",1777
7198,"much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your",1777
7199,"acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you",1777
7200,know.”,1777
7201,Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at,1778
7202,"Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She",1778
7203,"must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,",1778
7204,she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.,1778
7205,Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house,1779
7206,"richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the",1779
7207,grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the,1779
7208,country.”,1779
7209,Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The,1780
7210,"possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly",1780
7211,occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and,1780
7212,"thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such",1780
7213,a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved,1780
7214,"that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the",1780
7215,absence of the family were unfavourably answered.,1780
7216,"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid",1781
7217,"whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its",1781
7218,"proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for",1781
7219,the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her,1781
7220,"alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of",1781
7221,curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the,1781
7222,"next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and",1781
7223,"with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike",1781
7224,to the scheme.,1781
7225,"To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.",1782
7226,[Illustration:,1786

7229,CHAPTER XLIII.,1791
7230,[Illustration],1793
7231,"Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of",1794
7232,Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned,1794
7233,"in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.",1794
7234,"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They",1795
7235,"entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through",1795
7236,a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.,1795
7237,"Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired",1796
7238,every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for,1796
7239,"half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable",1796
7240,"eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by",1796
7241,"Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which",1796
7242,"the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone",1796
7243,"building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high",1796
7244,woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was,1796
7245,"swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks",1796
7246,were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She,1796
7247,"had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural",1796
7248,beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were,1796
7249,all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that,1796
7250,to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!,1796
7251,"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,",1797
7252,"while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of",1797
7253,meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been,1797
7254,"mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the",1797
7255,"hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to",1797
7256,wonder at her being where she was.,1797
7257,"The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less",1798
7258,"fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They",1798
7259,"followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned",1798
7260,"room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went",1798
7261,"to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from",1798
7262,"which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the",1798
7263,"distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was",1798
7264,"good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered",1798
7265,"on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace",1798
7266,"it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were",1798
7267,taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties,1798
7268,"to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture",1798
7269,"suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with",1798
7270,"admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly",1798
7271,"fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the",1798
7272,furniture of Rosings.,1798
7273,"“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With",1799
7274,these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of,1799
7275,"viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and",1799
7276,"welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting",1799
7277,"herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to",1799
7278,me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”,1799
7279,This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.,1800
7280,She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really,1801
7281,"absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was",1801
7282,"asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds",1801
7283,"replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large",1801
7284,party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had,1801
7285,not by any circumstance been delayed a day!,1801
7286,"Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw",1802
7287,"the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other",1802
7288,"miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how",1802
7289,"she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the",1802
7290,"picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who",1802
7291,had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the,1802
7292,"army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”",1802
7293,"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not",1803
7294,return it.,1803
7295,"“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,",1804
7296,“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the,1804
7297,other--about eight years ago.”,1804
7298,"“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,",1805
7299,"looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell",1805
7300,us whether it is like or not.”,1805
7301,Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this,1806
7302,intimation of her knowing her master.,1806
7303,“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”,1807
7304,"Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”",1808
7305,"“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”",1809
7306,"“Yes, very handsome.”",1810
7307,“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you,1811
7308,"will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late",1811
7309,"master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to",1811
7310,be then. He was very fond of them.”,1811
7311,This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.,1812
7312,"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn",1813
7313,when she was only eight years old.,1813
7314,“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.,1814
7315,"“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so",1815
7316,accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a,1815
7317,new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she,1815
7318,comes here to-morrow with him.”,1815
7319,"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her",1816
7320,"communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either",1816
7321,"from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her",1816
7322,master and his sister.,1816
7323,“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”,1817
7324,"“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his",1818
7325,time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”,1818
7326,"“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”",1819
7327,"“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”",1820
7328,"“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is",1821
7329,good enough for him.”,1821
7330,"Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is",1822
7331,"very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”",1822
7332,"“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows",1823
7333,"him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;",1823
7334,"and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,",1823
7335,"“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him",1823
7336,ever since he was four years old.”,1823
7337,"This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her",1824
7338,ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.,1824
7339,Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was,1824
7340,"grateful to her uncle for saying,--",1824
7341,“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in,1825
7342,having such a master.”,1825
7343,"“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not",1826
7344,"meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are",1826
7345,"good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he",1826
7346,"was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the",1826
7347,world.”,1826
7348,Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.,1827
7349,"“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.",1828
7350,"“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just",1829
7351,as affable to the poor.”,1829
7352,"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.",1830
7353,Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects,1830
7354,"of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the",1830
7355,"furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family",1830
7356,"prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her",1830
7357,"master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his",1830
7358,"many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.",1830
7359,"“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever",1831
7360,"lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but",1831
7361,themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will,1831
7362,give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never,1831
7363,"saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle",1831
7364,away like other young men.”,1831
7365,“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.,1832
7366,"“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not",1833
7367,quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”,1833
7368,“Perhaps we might be deceived.”,1834
7369,“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”,1835
7370,"On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty",1836
7371,"sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than",1836
7372,the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to,1836
7373,"give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when",1836
7374,last at Pemberley.,1836
7375,"“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards",1837
7376,one of the windows.,1837
7377,"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter",1838
7378,"the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever",1838
7379,"can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There",1838
7380,is nothing he would not do for her.”,1838
7381,"The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were",1839
7382,all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:,1839
7383,but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already,1839
7384,"visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss",1839
7385,"Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and",1839
7386,also more intelligible.,1839
7387,"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have",1840
7388,little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest,1840
7389,of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it,1840
7390,"arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with",1840
7391,"such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,",1840
7392,"when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in",1840
7393,"earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the",1840
7394,"gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his",1840
7395,father’s lifetime.,1840
7396,"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle",1841
7397,sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of,1841
7398,their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds,1841
7399,was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise,1841
7400,"of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she",1841
7401,considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How,1841
7402,much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good,1841
7403,or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by,1841
7404,the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before,1841
7405,"the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon",1841
7406,"herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude",1841
7407,"than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened",1841
7408,its impropriety of expression.,1841
7409,"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,",1842
7410,"they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were",1842
7411,"consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",1842
7412,"As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back",1843
7413,to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was,1843
7414,"conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself",1843
7415,suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.,1843
7416,They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his,1844
7417,"appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes",1844
7418,"instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest",1844
7419,"blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from",1844
7420,"surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,",1844
7421,"and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least",1844
7422,of perfect civility.,1844
7423,"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,",1845
7424,received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be,1845
7425,"overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture",1845
7426,"they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two",1845
7427,"that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on",1845
7428,"beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little",1845
7429,"aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,",1845
7430,"scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she",1845
7431,returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the,1845
7432,"alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he",1845
7433,uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the,1845
7434,"impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few",1845
7435,minutes in which they continued together were some of the most,1845
7436,uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he,1845
7437,"spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his",1845
7438,"inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay",1845
7439,"in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the",1845
7440,distraction of his thoughts.,1845
7441,"At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few",1846
7442,"moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took",1846
7443,leave.,1846
7444,"The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his",1847
7445,"figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own",1847
7446,"feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and",1847
7447,"vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged",1847
7448,thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a,1847
7449,disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if,1847
7450,she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?,1847
7451,"or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been",1847
7452,"only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his",1847
7453,"discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that",1847
7454,moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and,1847
7455,"again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so",1847
7456,"strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to",1847
7457,"her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her",1847
7458,"family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,",1847
7459,never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.,1847
7460,"What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when",1847
7461,"he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to",1847
7462,account for it.,1847
7463,"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and",1848
7464,"every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer",1848
7465,reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time,1848
7466,"before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered",1848
7467,"mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed",1848
7468,"to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she",1848
7469,distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that,1848
7470,"one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then",1848
7471,was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in,1848
7472,"what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,",1848
7473,she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he,1848
7474,"felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was",1848
7475,not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing,1848
7476,"her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with",1848
7477,composure.,1848
7478,"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind",1849
7479,"roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.",1849
7480,"They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,",1850
7481,"ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening",1850
7482,"of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of",1850
7483,"the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods",1850
7484,"overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner",1850
7485,"expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be",1850
7486,"beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten",1850
7487,miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed,1850
7488,"circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among",1850
7489,"hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.",1850
7490,"They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of",1850
7491,the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and,1850
7492,"the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the",1850
7493,"stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered",1850
7494,it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed,1850
7495,"the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,",1850
7496,"who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of",1850
7497,"returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,",1850
7498,"therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house",1850
7499,"on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their",1850
7500,"progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the",1850
7501,"taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the",1850
7502,"occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man",1850
7503,"about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this",1850
7504,"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was",1850
7505,"quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy",1850
7506,"approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less",1850
7507,"sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they",1850
7508,"met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an",1850
7509,"interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with",1850
7510,"calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,",1850
7511,she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea,1850
7512,lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the,1850
7513,"turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that",1850
7514,"he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,",1850
7515,she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not,1850
7516,"got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky",1850
7517,"recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from",1850
7518,"her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said",1850
7519,no more.,1850
7520,"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked",1851
7521,her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.,1851
7522,This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and,1851
7523,she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the,1851
7524,"acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had",1851
7525,"revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought",1851
7526,"she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of",1851
7527,fashion.”,1851
7528,"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their",1852
7529,"relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore",1852
7530,it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he,1852
7531,could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the,1852
7532,"connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,",1852
7533,"so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into",1852
7534,"conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,",1852
7535,could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some,1852
7536,relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most,1852
7537,"attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every",1852
7538,"expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,",1852
7539,"his taste, or his good manners.",1852
7540,The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy,1853
7541,"invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he",1853
7542,"chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same",1853
7543,"time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of",1853
7544,"the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was",1853
7545,"walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her",1853
7546,"wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the",1853
7547,"compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was",1853
7548,"extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From",1853
7549,"what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake",1853
7550,that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not,1853
7551,work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love,1853
7552,me.”,1853
7553,"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two",1854
7554,"gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the",1854
7555,brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious,1854
7556,"water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in",1854
7557,"Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found",1854
7558,"Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred",1854
7559,"her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on",1854
7560,together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to,1854
7561,know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the,1854
7562,"place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been",1854
7563,"very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that",1854
7564,"you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we",1854
7565,"left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in",1854
7566,the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that,1854
7567,business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours,1854
7568,before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They,1854
7569,"will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some",1854
7570,"who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”",1854
7571,Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly,1855
7572,driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned,1855
7573,"between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was",1855
7574,not very differently engaged.,1855
7575,"“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a",1856
7576,"pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow",1856
7577,"me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance",1856
7578,during your stay at Lambton?”,1856
7579,The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great,1857
7580,for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt,1857
7581,"that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,",1857
7582,"must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was",1857
7583,satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made,1857
7584,him think really ill of her.,1857
7585,They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth,1858
7586,was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and,1858
7587,pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of,1858
7588,the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had,1858
7589,"reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a",1858
7590,mile behind.,1858
7591,He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not,1859
7592,"tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might",1859
7593,"have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but",1859
7594,there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that,1859
7595,"she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with",1859
7596,great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience,1859
7597,and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.,1859
7598,On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into,1860
7599,"the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they",1860
7600,parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the,1860
7601,"ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him",1860
7602,walking slowly towards the house.,1860
7603,The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them,1861
7604,pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.,1861
7605,"“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.",1862
7606,"“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her",1863
7607,"aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now",1863
7608,"say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,",1863
7609,_I_ have seen nothing of it.”,1863
7610,“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more,1864
7611,than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such,1864
7612,attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”,1864
7613,"“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;",1865
7614,"or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are",1865
7615,perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so,1865
7616,disagreeable?”,1865
7617,Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked,1866
7618,"him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never",1866
7619,seen him so pleasant as this morning.,1866
7620,"“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied",1867
7621,her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him,1867
7622,"at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and",1867
7623,warn me off his grounds.”,1867
7624,"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said",1868
7625,nothing.,1868
7626,"“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really",1869
7627,should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by,1869
7628,anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.,1869
7629,"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he",1869
7630,"speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would",1869
7631,"not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the",1869
7632,good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!,1869
7633,I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal,1869
7634,"master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends",1869
7635,every virtue.”,1869
7636,Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of,1870
7637,"his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as",1870
7638,"guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his",1870
7639,"relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different",1870
7640,"construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor",1870
7641,"Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In",1870
7642,"confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary",1870
7643,"transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming",1870
7644,"her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.",1870
7645,Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now,1871
7646,"approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to",1871
7647,the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out,1871
7648,"to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of",1871
7649,"anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had",1871
7650,no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former,1871
7651,"acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an",1871
7652,intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.,1871
7653,The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth,1872
7654,much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing,1872
7655,"but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above",1872
7656,"all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.",1872
7657,[Illustration],1876
7658,CHAPTER XLIV.,1880
7659,[Illustration],1882
7660,Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit,1883
7661,"her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,",1883
7662,resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.,1883
7663,But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own,1883
7664,arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the,1883
7665,"place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn",1883
7666,"to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a",1883
7667,"carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a",1883
7668,"curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the",1883
7669,"livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise",1883
7670,"to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she",1883
7671,expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment,1883
7672,"of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many",1883
7673,"of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on",1883
7674,"the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt",1883
7675,that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such,1883
7676,a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these,1883
7677,"newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of",1883
7678,Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed,1883
7679,"at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she",1883
7680,dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in,1883
7681,"her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally",1883
7682,suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.,1883
7683,"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked",1884
7684,"up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of",1884
7685,inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.,1884
7686,"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction",1885
7687,took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new,1885
7688,acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her,1885
7689,"being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;",1885
7690,but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was,1885
7691,only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from,1885
7692,her beyond a monosyllable.,1885
7693,"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though",1886
7694,"little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance",1886
7695,"womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there",1886
7696,"was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly",1886
7697,"unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as",1886
7698,"acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much",1886
7699,relieved by discerning such different feelings.,1886
7700,They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was,1887
7701,also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her,1887
7702,"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step",1887
7703,"was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All",1887
7704,Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still,1887
7705,"felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected",1887
7706,cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He,1887
7707,"inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and",1887
7708,looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.,1887
7709,To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage,1888
7710,than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before,1888
7711,"them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just",1888
7712,"arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards",1888
7713,"each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from",1888
7714,those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what,1888
7715,it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in,1888
7716,doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was,1888
7717,evident enough.,1888
7718,"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the",1889
7719,"feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to",1889
7720,"make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she",1889
7721,"feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom",1889
7722,she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.,1889
7723,"Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be",1889
7724,pleased.,1889
7725,[Illustration:,1890
7726,     “To make herself agreeable to all”,1891
7727,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],1892
7728,"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!",1893
7729,how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a,1893
7730,like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on,1893
7731,"former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion",1893
7732,"that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,",1893
7733,"though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his",1893
7734,"behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No",1893
7735,look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing,1893
7736,occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On,1893
7737,this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances,1893
7738,"occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted",1893
7739,"a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of",1893
7740,"saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He",1893
7741,"observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and",1893
7742,"in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long",1893
7743,"time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could",1893
7744,"reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the",1893
7745,"26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”",1893
7746,Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards,1894
7747,"took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether",1894
7748,"_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,",1894
7749,nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which,1894
7750,gave them meaning.,1894
7751,It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,1895
7752,whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general,1895
7753,"complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far",1895
7754,"removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her",1895
7755,"that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,",1895
7756,"however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one",1895
7757,"day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the",1895
7758,good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would,1895
7759,"have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,",1895
7760,"but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected",1895
7761,"their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the",1895
7762,"change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could",1895
7763,"hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the",1895
7764,"company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations",1895
7765,"at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from",1895
7766,"self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could",1895
7767,"result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the",1895
7768,"acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw",1895
7769,down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and,1895
7770,Rosings.,1895
7771,Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose,1896
7772,"to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing",1896
7773,"their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner",1896
7774,"at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a",1896
7775,"diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,",1896
7776,"readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing",1896
7777,"how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its",1896
7778,"acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,",1896
7779,that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than,1896
7780,"any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of",1896
7781,"society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for",1896
7782,"her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.",1896
7783,Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth,1897
7784,"again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to",1897
7785,"make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all",1897
7786,"this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and",1897
7787,"on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their",1897
7788,"visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some",1897
7789,"satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been",1897
7790,"little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her",1897
7791,"uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their",1897
7792,"favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.",1897
7793,But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was,1898
7794,not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was,1898
7795,much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;,1898
7796,it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to,1898
7797,"interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.",1898
7798,"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far",1899
7799,"as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could",1899
7800,not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character,1899
7801,"from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference",1899
7802,"to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known",1899
7803,"would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,",1899
7804,"however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible",1899
7805,"that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four",1899
7806,"years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be",1899
7807,hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of,1899
7808,their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had,1899
7809,"nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,",1899
7810,it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town,1899
7811,"where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he",1899
7812,"was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.",1899
7813,"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held",1900
7814,there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the,1900
7815,"son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known",1900
7816,"fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind",1900
7817,"him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.",1900
7818,"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than",1901
7819,"the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not",1901
7820,long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and,1901
7821,"she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She",1901
7822,"certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she",1901
7823,"had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,",1901
7824,that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his,1901
7825,"valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some",1901
7826,time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened,1901
7827,into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his,1901
7828,"favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,",1901
7829,"which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,",1901
7830,there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be,1901
7831,"overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once",1901
7832,"loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the",1901
7833,"petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the",1901
7834,"unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been",1901
7835,"persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this",1901
7836,"accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and",1901
7837,"without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,",1901
7838,"where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good",1901
7839,"opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such",1901
7840,a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but,1901
7841,"gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as",1901
7842,"such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no",1901
7843,"means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,",1901
7844,"she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his",1901
7845,welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to,1901
7846,"depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both",1901
7847,"that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still",1901
7848,"possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",1901
7849,"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that",1902
7850,"such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very",1902
7851,day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late,1902
7852,"breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by",1902
7853,"some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it",1902
7854,would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following,1902
7855,"morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when",1902
7856,"she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",1902
7857,Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been,1903
7858,"renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting",1903
7859,some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.,1903
7860,[Illustration:,1907

7863,CHAPTER XLV.,1912
7864,[Illustration],1914
7865,Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had,1915
7866,"originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome",1915
7867,"her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know",1915
7868,with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now,1915
7869,be renewed.,1915
7870,"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,",1916
7871,"whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,",1916
7872,"opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody",1916
7873,"hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts",1916
7874,which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.,1916
7875,"In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there",1917
7876,"with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in",1917
7877,"London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with",1917
7878,"all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the",1917
7879,"fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves",1917
7880,inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and,1917
7881,"her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.",1917
7882,By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and,1918
7883,"on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,",1918
7884,"succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a",1918
7885,"genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind",1918
7886,of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the,1918
7887,"others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from",1918
7888,"Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she",1918
7889,wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a,1918
7890,"short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.",1918
7891,"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,",1919
7892,"and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without",1919
7893,calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her,1919
7894,"from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an",1919
7895,inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity,1919
7896,of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every,1919
7897,"moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she",1919
7898,"feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether",1919
7899,"she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After",1919
7900,"sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss",1919
7901,"Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold",1919
7902,inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal,1919
7903,"indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.",1919
7904,The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the,1920
7905,"entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the",1920
7906,finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a,1920
7907,significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been,1920
7908,"given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole",1920
7909,"party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the",1920
7910,"beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected",1920
7911,them round the table.,1920
7912,"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether",1921
7913,"she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the",1921
7914,"feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but",1921
7915,"a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to",1921
7916,regret that he came.,1921
7917,"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other",1922
7918,"gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him",1922
7919,only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to,1922
7920,"Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely",1922
7921,resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more,1922
7922,"necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she",1922
7923,"saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,",1922
7924,and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour,1922
7925,when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive,1922
7926,"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the",1922
7927,smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its,1922
7928,"objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions",1922
7929,"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s",1922
7930,"entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he",1922
7931,"was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,",1922
7932,"as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss",1922
7933,"Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the",1922
7934,"first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--",1922
7935,"“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?",1923
7936,They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”,1923
7937,In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth,1924
7938,instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the,1924
7939,various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;,1924
7940,"but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she",1924
7941,presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While,1924
7942,"she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened",1924
7943,"complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with",1924
7944,"confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what",1924
7945,"pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have",1924
7946,refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose,1924
7947,"Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed",1924
7948,"her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in",1924
7949,"Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies",1924
7950,and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with,1924
7951,that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s,1924
7952,"meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy",1924
7953,"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections",1924
7954,"her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish",1924
7955,"which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming",1924
7956,hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without,1924
7957,meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss,1924
7958,"Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern",1924
7959,for the welfare of his friend.,1924
7960,"Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and",1925
7961,"as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to",1925
7962,"Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able",1925
7963,"to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely",1925
7964,recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which,1925
7965,"had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have",1925
7966,fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.,1925
7967,Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above,1926
7968,"mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,",1926
7969,Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s,1926
7970,"person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her",1926
7971,brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment,1926
7972,"could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave",1926
7973,Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and,1926
7974,"amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help",1926
7975,repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.,1926
7976,"“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I",1927
7977,never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.,1927
7978,She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we,1927
7979,should not have known her again.”,1927
7980,"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented",1928
7981,"himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than",1928
7982,"her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the",1928
7983,summer.,1928
7984,"“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see",1929
7985,any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no,1929
7986,brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants,1929
7987,character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are,1929
7988,"tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which",1929
7989,"have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything",1929
7990,"extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not",1929
7991,"like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency",1929
7992,"without fashion, which is intolerable.”",1929
7993,"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not",1930
7994,the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always,1930
7995,"wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the",1930
7996,"success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a",1930
7997,"determination of making him speak, she continued,--",1930
7998,"“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all",1931
7999,were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect,1931
8000,"your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_",1931
8001,a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she,1931
8002,"seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at",1931
8003,one time.”,1931
8004,"“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_",1932
8005,was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have,1932
8006,considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”,1932
8007,"He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of",1933
8008,having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.,1933
8009,Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their,1934
8010,"visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them",1934
8011,"both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,",1934
8012,except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked,1934
8013,"of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but",1934
8014,himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of,1934
8015,"him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s",1934
8016,beginning the subject.,1934
8017,[Illustration],1938
8018,Chapter XLVI.,1942
8019,[Illustration],1944
8020,Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from,1945
8021,Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been,1945
8022,renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on,1945
8023,"the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the",1945
8024,"receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that",1945
8025,"it had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as",1945
8026,Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.,1945
8027,They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her,1946
8028,"uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by",1946
8029,themselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been,1946
8030,written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their,1946
8031,"little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;",1946
8032,"but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident",1946
8033,"agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--",1946
8034,"“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a",1947
8035,most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be,1947
8036,assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.,1947
8037,"An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,",1947
8038,"from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland",1947
8039,"with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our",1947
8040,"surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am",1947
8041,"very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing",1947
8042,"to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.",1947
8043,"Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and",1947
8044,let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is,1947
8045,"disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.",1947
8046,Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How,1947
8047,"thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against",1947
8048,him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about,1947
8049,"twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at",1947
8050,"eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have",1947
8051,passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect,1947
8052,"him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of",1947
8053,"their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor",1947
8054,"mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly",1947
8055,know what I have written.”,1947
8056,"Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing",1948
8057,"what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the",1948
8058,"other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it",1948
8059,had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.,1948
8060,"“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I",1949
8061,"wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my",1949
8062,head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest,1949
8063,"Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,",1949
8064,and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham,1949
8065,"and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has",1949
8066,"taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone",1949
8067,"to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the",1949
8068,"day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short",1949
8069,letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna,1949
8070,"Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.",1949
8071,"never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated",1949
8072,"to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,",1949
8073,"intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but",1949
8074,"no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a",1949
8075,"hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.",1949
8076,"All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the",1949
8077,London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible,1949
8078,"inquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,",1949
8079,"anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet",1949
8080,"and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to",1949
8081,"pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and",1949
8082,broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.,1949
8083,I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any,1949
8084,"blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and",1949
8085,"mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many",1949
8086,circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married,1949
8087,privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_,1949
8088,"could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,",1949
8089,"which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?",1949
8090,"Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed",1949
8091,to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my,1949
8092,"hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother",1949
8093,"is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be",1949
8094,"better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in",1949
8095,my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed,1949
8096,"their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot",1949
8097,"wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared",1949
8098,"something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is",1949
8099,"over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,",1949
8100,"however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen",1949
8101,"again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances",1949
8102,"are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as",1949
8103,"soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not",1949
8104,"afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of",1949
8105,"the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,",1949
8106,"to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but",1949
8107,his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the,1949
8108,"best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton",1949
8109,again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and,1949
8110,assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately,1949
8111,"comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”",1949
8112,"“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat",1950
8113,"as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a",1950
8114,"moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was",1950
8115,"opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and",1950
8116,"impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself",1950
8117,"enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s",1950
8118,"situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.",1950
8119,I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;,1950
8120,I have not an instant to lose.”,1950
8121,"“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than",1951
8122,"politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;",1951
8123,"but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are",1951
8124,not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”,1951
8125,"Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how",1952
8126,little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back,1952
8127,"the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an",1952
8128,"accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and",1952
8129,mistress home instantly.,1952
8130,"On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and",1953
8131,"looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,",1953
8132,"or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,",1953
8133,“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you,1953
8134,present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”,1953
8135,"“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There",1954
8136,"is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by",1954
8137,some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”,1954
8138,"She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could",1955
8139,"not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say",1955
8140,something indistinctly of his,1955
8141,[Illustration:,1956
8142,     “I have not an instant to lose”,1957
8143,],1957
8144,"concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke",1958
8145,"again. “I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It",1958
8146,cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her,1958
8147,friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.,1958
8148,Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too,1958
8149,"well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that",1958
8150,can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”,1958
8151,Darcy was fixed in astonishment.,1959
8152,"“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_",1960
8153,might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained,1960
8154,"some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had",1960
8155,"his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,",1960
8156,all too late now.”,1960
8157,"“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it",1961
8158,"certain, absolutely certain?”",1961
8159,"“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced",1962
8160,"almost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to",1962
8161,Scotland.”,1962
8162,"“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”",1963
8163,"“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s",1964
8164,"immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But",1964
8165,nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is,1964
8166,such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have,1964
8167,not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”,1964
8168,Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.,1965
8169,"“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what",1966
8170,"I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too",1966
8171,"much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”",1966
8172,"Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up",1967
8173,"and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air",1967
8174,"gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power",1967
8175,was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family,1967
8176,"weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither",1967
8177,wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing,1967
8178,"consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It",1967
8179,"was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own",1967
8180,wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved,1967
8181,"him, as now, when all love must be vain.",1967
8182,"But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the",1968
8183,"humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up",1968
8184,"every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,",1968
8185,"Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of",1968
8186,"several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the",1968
8187,"voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke",1968
8188,"compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--",1968
8189,"“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything",1969
8190,"to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.",1969
8191,"Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,",1969
8192,that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment,1969
8193,"you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.",1969
8194,"This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the",1969
8195,pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”,1969
8196,"“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that",1970
8197,urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as,1970
8198,long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”,1970
8199,"He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for",1971
8200,"her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present",1971
8201,"reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with",1971
8202,"only one serious parting look, went away.",1971
8203,"As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they",1972
8204,should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had,1972
8205,marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a,1972
8206,"retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of",1972
8207,"contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those",1972
8208,"feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would",1972
8209,formerly have rejoiced in its termination.,1972
8210,"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s",1973
8211,change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if,1973
8212,"otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or",1973
8213,"unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a",1973
8214,"first interview with its object, and even before two words have been",1973
8215,"exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given",1973
8216,"somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,",1973
8217,"and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other",1973
8218,"less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go",1973
8219,with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must,1973
8220,"produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched",1973
8221,business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a,1973
8222,"hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,",1973
8223,could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least,1973
8224,of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first,1973
8225,"letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,",1973
8226,that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry,1973
8227,for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared,1973
8228,incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment,1973
8229,"as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not",1973
8230,"suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the",1973
8231,"intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither",1973
8232,her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy,1973
8233,prey.,1973
8234,"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that",1974
8235,Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had,1974
8236,wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one,1974
8237,"officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions",1974
8238,raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually,1974
8239,"fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and",1974
8240,mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now,1974
8241,feel it!,1974
8242,"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to",1975
8243,"share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a",1975
8244,"family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and",1975
8245,requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing,1975
8246,"could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost",1975
8247,"importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience",1975
8248,"was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,",1975
8249,"by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but",1975
8250,"satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the",1975
8251,"cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on",1975
8252,the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never,1975
8253,"been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be",1975
8254,"deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after",1975
8255,"the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily",1975
8256,"promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no",1975
8257,"less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated",1975
8258,"by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily",1975
8259,settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be,1975
8260,done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was,1975
8261,here when you sent for us;--was it so?”,1975
8262,“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.,1976
8263,_That_ is all settled.”,1976
8264,"“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to",1977
8265,prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real,1977
8266,"truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”",1977
8267,"But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the",1978
8268,hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure,1978
8269,"to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was",1978
8270,impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of,1978
8271,"business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to",1978
8272,"be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their",1978
8273,"sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.",1978
8274,"Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing",1978
8275,"remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of",1978
8276,"the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could",1978
8277,"have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",1978
8278,[Illustration:,1982

8281,CHAPTER XLVII.,1987
8282,[Illustration],1989
8283,"“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they",1990
8284,"drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much",1990
8285,more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the,1990
8286,matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form,1990
8287,such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or,1990
8288,"friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I",1990
8289,am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends,1990
8290,would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the,1990
8291,"regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is",1990
8292,not adequate to the risk.”,1990
8293,"“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.",1991
8294,"“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s",1992
8295,"opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and",1992
8296,"interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of",1992
8297,"Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe",1992
8298,him capable of it?”,1992
8299,“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect,1993
8300,"I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not",1993
8301,"hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the",1993
8302,case?”,1993
8303,"“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof",1994
8304,that they are not gone to Scotland.”,1994
8305,"“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a",1995
8306,"presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the",1995
8307,Barnet road.”,1995
8308,"“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though",1996
8309,"for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is",1996
8310,not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it,1996
8311,"might strike them that they could be more economically, though less",1996
8312,"expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”",1996
8313,“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their,1997
8314,"marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular",1997
8315,"friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending",1997
8316,to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He,1997
8317,"cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she",1997
8318,"beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake",1997
8319,forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what,1997
8320,restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a,1997
8321,"dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know",1997
8322,nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your,1997
8323,"other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no",1997
8324,"brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s",1997
8325,"behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever",1997
8326,"seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would",1997
8327,"do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in",1997
8328,such a matter.”,1997
8329,"“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,",1998
8330,as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”,1998
8331,"“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with",1999
8332,"tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such",1999
8333,"a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.",1999
8334,Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never,1999
8335,"been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,",1999
8336,"nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement",1999
8337,and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle,1999
8338,"and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.",1999
8339,"Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,",1999
8340,"flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing",1999
8341,"everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give",1999
8342,greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which,1999
8343,are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every,1999
8344,charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”,1999
8345,"“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of",2000
8346,"Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”",2000
8347,"“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be",2001
8348,"their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,",2001
8349,"till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what",2001
8350,Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every,2001
8351,sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is,2001
8352,as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”,2001
8353,"“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity",2002
8354,as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.,2002
8355,"“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day",2003
8356,"of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at",2003
8357,"Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with",2003
8358,such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other,2003
8359,circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to,2003
8360,relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From,2003
8361,"what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,",2003
8362,"reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He",2003
8363,must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found,2003
8364,her.”,2003
8365,“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you,2004
8366,and Jane seem so well to understand?”,2004
8367,"“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw",2005
8368,"so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was",2005
8369,ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire,2005
8370,was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the,2005
8371,"case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it",2005
8372,necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it,2005
8373,"apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the",2005
8374,"neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it",2005
8375,"was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of",2005
8376,opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could,2005
8377,be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a,2005
8378,"consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far",2005
8379,enough from my thoughts.”,2005
8380,"“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I",2006
8381,"suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”",2006
8382,“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either,2007
8383,"side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware",2007
8384,that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first,2007
8385,"he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all",2007
8386,were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for,2007
8387,the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular,2007
8388,"attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and",2007
8389,"wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,",2007
8390,"who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”",2007
8391,"It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added",2008
8392,"to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by",2008
8393,"its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during",2008
8394,the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.,2008
8395,"Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could",2008
8396,find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.,2008
8397,They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on,2009
8398,"the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort",2009
8399,to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long,2009
8400,expectations.,2009
8401,"The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing",2010
8402,"on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the",2010
8403,"carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their",2010
8404,"faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of",2010
8405,"capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.",2010
8406,"Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,",2011
8407,"hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from",2011
8408,"her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.",2011
8409,"Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the",2012
8410,"eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been",2012
8411,heard of the fugitives.,2012
8412,"“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope",2013
8413,everything will be well.”,2013
8414,“Is my father in town?”,2014
8415,"“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”",2015
8416,“And have you heard from him often?”,2016
8417,"“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say",2017
8418,"that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I",2017
8419,"particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write",2017
8420,"again, till he had something of importance to mention.”",2017
8421,“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”,2018
8422,"“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly",2019
8423,"shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you",2019
8424,"all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank",2019
8425,Heaven! are quite well.”,2019
8426,“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you,2020
8427,must have gone through!”,2020
8428,"Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their",2021
8429,"conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were",2021
8430,"engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of",2021
8431,"the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and",2021
8432,"thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.",2021
8433,"When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth",2022
8434,"had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon",2022
8435,"found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,",2022
8436,"however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet",2022
8437,"deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that",2022
8438,"every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,",2022
8439,"to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.",2022
8440,"Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’",2023
8441,"conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with",2023
8442,"tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous",2023
8443,"conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;",2023
8444,blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the,2023
8445,errors of her daughter must be principally owing.,2023
8446,"“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton",2024
8447,"with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia",2024
8448,had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out,2024
8449,of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their,2024
8450,"side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had",2024
8451,been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have,2024
8452,"the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear",2024
8453,"child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight",2024
8454,"Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is",2024
8455,"to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold",2024
8456,"in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what",2024
8457,we shall do.”,2024
8458,"They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after",2025
8459,"general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her",2025
8460,"that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.",2025
8461,Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.,2025
8462,"“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be",2026
8463,"prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.",2026
8464,"It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we",2026
8465,"may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,",2026
8466,"and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as",2026
8467,"lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him",2026
8468,"come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult",2026
8469,together as to what is to be done.”,2026
8470,"“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I",2027
8471,"could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,",2027
8472,"wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them",2027
8473,"marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but",2027
8474,"tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,",2027
8475,"after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from",2027
8476,fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened,2027
8477,"out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,",2027
8478,"such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my",2027
8479,"heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear",2027
8480,"Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,",2027
8481,"for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how",2027
8482,kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”,2027
8483,"But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours",2028
8484,"in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in",2028
8485,her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till,2028
8486,"dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the",2028
8487,"housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.",2028
8488,Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real,2029
8489,"occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to",2029
8490,oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her,2029
8491,"tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it",2029
8492,"better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could",2029
8493,"most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the",2029
8494,subject.,2029
8495,"In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been",2030
8496,too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance,2030
8497,"before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The",2030
8498,"faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible",2030
8499,"in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger",2030
8500,"which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more",2030
8501,"of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was",2030
8502,"mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance",2030
8503,"of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--",2030
8504,"“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.",2031
8505,"But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of",2031
8506,each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”,2031
8507,"Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,",2032
8508,"“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful",2032
8509,"lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one",2032
8510,"false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less",2032
8511,"brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in",2032
8512,her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”,2032
8513,"Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to",2033
8514,"make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such",2033
8515,kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.,2033
8516,"In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an",2034
8517,hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the,2034
8518,opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to,2034
8519,satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel,2034
8520,"of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss",2034
8521,"Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued",2034
8522,"the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I",2034
8523,have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel,2034
8524,Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement,2034
8525,took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”,2034
8526,"“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,",2035
8527,"especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so",2035
8528,grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He,2035
8529,"_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had",2035
8530,any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension,2035
8531,"first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”",2035
8532,“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of,2036
8533,their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”,2036
8534,"“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of",2037
8535,"their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not",2037
8536,"repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am",2037
8537,inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”,2037
8538,"“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a",2038
8539,"doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”",2038
8540,“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a,2039
8541,little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in,2039
8542,"marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite",2039
8543,right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how,2039
8544,"imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural",2039
8545,"triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter",2039
8546,"she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their",2039
8547,being in love with each other many weeks.”,2039
8548,“But not before they went to Brighton?”,2040
8549,"“No, I believe not.”",2041
8550,“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he,2042
8551,know his real character?”,2042
8552,“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly,2043
8553,did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad,2043
8554,"affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:",2043
8555,but I hope this may be false.”,2043
8556,"“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,",2044
8557,this could not have happened!”,2044
8558,"“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.",2045
8559,"“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what",2046
8560,"their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”",2046
8561,“We acted with the best intentions.”,2047
8562,“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his,2048
8563,wife?”,2048
8564,“He brought it with him for us to see.”,2049
8565,"Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These",2050
8566,were the contents:--,2050
8567,"     /* NIND “My dear Harriet, */",2051
8568,"     “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help",2052
8569,"     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am",2052
8570,"     missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with",2052
8571,"     who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the",2052
8572,"     world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without",2052
8573,"     him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at",2052
8574,"     Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the",2052
8575,"     surprise the greater when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia",2052
8576,     Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for,2052
8577,     laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my,2052
8578,"     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will",2052
8579,"     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at",2052
8580,     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. I shall send for my,2052
8581,     clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to,2052
8582,     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed,2052
8583,     up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will,2052
8584,     drink to our good journey.,2052
8585,"“Your affectionate friend,",2053
8586,“LYDIA BENNET.”,2054
8587,"“Oh, thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had",2056
8588,"finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But",2056
8589,at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.,2056
8590,"Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a",2056
8591,_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”,2056
8592,“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten,2057
8593,"minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in",2057
8594,such confusion!”,2057
8595,"“Oh, Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who",2058
8596,did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”,2058
8597,“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is,2059
8598,very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to,2059
8599,"give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much",2059
8600,as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen,2059
8601,almost took from me my faculties.”,2059
8602,“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look,2060
8603,well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety,2060
8604,upon yourself alone.”,2060
8605,"“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every",2061
8606,"fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.",2061
8607,"Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of",2061
8608,repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on,2061
8609,"Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till",2061
8610,"Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady",2061
8611,Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to,2061
8612,"condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if",2061
8613,they could be of use to us.”,2061
8614,"“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she",2062
8615,"_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too",2062
8616,"little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,",2062
8617,"insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”",2062
8618,She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had,2063
8619,"intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.",2063
8620,"“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where",2064
8621,"they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could",2064
8622,be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the,2064
8623,number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come,2064
8624,with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a,2064
8625,gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be,2064
8626,"remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow",2064
8627,"discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he",2064
8628,"determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible",2064
8629,to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any,2064
8630,"other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,",2064
8631,"and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding",2064
8632,out even so much as this.”,2064

8637,[Illustration],2075
8638,The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next,2076
8639,"morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.",2076
8640,"His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and",2076
8641,dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.,2076
8642,"They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to",2076
8643,send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.,2076
8644,Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.,2076
8645,"When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant",2077
8646,"information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,",2077
8647,"to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to",2077
8648,"the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only",2077
8649,security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.,2077
8650,Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few,2078
8651,"days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to",2078
8652,"her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a",2078
8653,great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also,2078
8654,"visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of",2078
8655,"cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without",2078
8656,"reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,",2078
8657,she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found,2078
8658,them.,2078
8659,"All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months",2079
8660,"before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt",2079
8661,"to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with",2079
8662,"the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.",2079
8663,Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and,2079
8664,everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the,2079
8665,"appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above",2079
8666,"half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of",2079
8667,"her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still",2079
8668,"less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now",2079
8669,"come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before",2079
8670,"entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some",2079
8671,news of them.,2079
8672,"Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a",2080
8673,"letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately",2080
8674,"found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.",2080
8675,"That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but",2080
8676,without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now,2080
8677,"determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet",2080
8678,"thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first",2080
8679,"coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself",2080
8680,did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was,2080
8681,"eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.",2080
8682,"Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and",2080
8683,promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this,2080
8684,effect:--,2080
8685,"“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if",2081
8686,"possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,",2081
8687,whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to,2081
8688,know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there,2081
8689,"were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such",2081
8690,"a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have",2081
8691,"nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in",2081
8692,"his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps",2081
8693,Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any,2081
8694,other person.”,2081
8695,Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for,2082
8696,her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any,2082
8697,information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.,2082
8698,"She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father",2083
8699,"and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,",2083
8700,"however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to",2083
8701,give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting,2083
8702,"it, the application was a something to look forward to.",2083
8703,Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious,2084
8704,part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was,2084
8705,"the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,",2084
8706,whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every,2084
8707,succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.,2084
8708,"But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for",2085
8709,"their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane",2085
8710,"had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,",2085
8711,"she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his",2085
8712,"letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as",2085
8713,follows:--,2085
8714,"     /* “My dear Sir, */",2086
8715,"     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation",2087
8716,"     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now",2087
8717,"     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter",2087
8718,"     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and",2087
8719,"     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable",2087
8720,"     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest",2087
8721,"     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No",2087
8722,"     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe",2087
8723,"     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that",2087
8724,"     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The",2087
8725,     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of,2087
8726,"     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to",2087
8727,"     suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness",2087

8733,"     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,",2091
8734,     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally,2091
8735,"     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an",2091
8736,"     age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in",2091
8737,"     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by",2091
8738,"     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.",2091
8739,     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one,2091
8740,     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for,2091
8741,"     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect",2091
8742,"     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,",2091
8743,"     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain",2091
8744,"     event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been",2091
8745,"     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,",2091
8746,"     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off",2091
8747,"     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to",2091
8748,     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.,2091
8749,"“I am, dear sir,” etc., etc.",2092
8750,"Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from",2093
8751,Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.,2093
8752,It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up,2093
8753,"any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His",2093
8754,former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the,2093
8755,"militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship",2093
8756,"with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out",2093
8757,as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own,2093
8758,"finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to",2093
8759,his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired,2093
8760,that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.,2093
8761,Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be,2093
8762,necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the,2093
8763,"town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner",2093
8764,did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;,2093
8765,Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly,2093
8766,unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”,2093
8767,"Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their",2094
8768,"father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered",2094
8769,"spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to",2094
8770,his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and,2094
8771,leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable,2094
8772,"for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did",2094
8773,"not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering",2094
8774,what her anxiety for his life had been before.,2094
8775,"“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he",2095
8776,"will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,",2095
8777,"and make him marry her, if he comes away?”",2095
8778,"As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she",2096
8779,and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet,2096
8780,"came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their",2096
8781,"journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.",2096
8782,Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her,2097
8783,"Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.",2097
8784,His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;,2097
8785,"and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of",2097
8786,"their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.",2097
8787,"Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from",2097
8788,Pemberley.,2097
8789,The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for,2098
8790,"the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be",2098
8791,"fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time",2098
8792,"tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware",2098
8793,"that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of",2098

8795,one sleepless night out of two.,2098
8796,"When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual",2099
8797,philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the,2099
8798,habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him,2099
8799,away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of,2099
8800,it.,2099
8801,"It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that",2100
8802,"Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly",2100
8803,"expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say",2100
8804,"nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,",2100
8805,and I ought to feel it.”,2100
8806,"“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.",2101
8807,“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to,2102
8808,"fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have",2102
8809,been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.,2102
8810,It will pass away soon enough.”,2102
8811,“Do you suppose them to be in London?”,2103
8812,“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”,2104
8813,"“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.",2105
8814,"“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there",2106
8815,will probably be of some duration.”,2106
8816,"Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no",2107
8817,"ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,",2107
8818,"considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”",2107
8819,"They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s",2108
8820,tea.,2108
8821,"“This is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an",2109
8822,elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my,2109
8823,"library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as",2109
8824,"I can,--or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”",2109
8825,"“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty, fretfully. “If _I_",2110
8826,"should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”",2110
8827,"“_You_ go to Brighton! I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne,",2111
8828,"for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at least learnt to be cautious, and",2111
8829,you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house,2111
8830,"again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely",2111
8831,"prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are",2111
8832,"never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten",2111
8833,minutes of every day in a rational manner.”,2111
8834,"Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.",2112
8835,"“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good",2113
8836,"girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of",2113

8841,"Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking",2124
8842,"together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper",2124
8843,"coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their",2124
8844,"mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,",2124
8845,"when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,",2124
8846,"madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some",2124
8847,"good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”",2124
8848,"“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”",2125
8849,"“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know",2126
8850,there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here,2126
8851,"this half hour, and master has had a letter.”",2126
8852,"Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They",2127
8853,ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the,2127
8854,library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of,2127
8855,"seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the",2127
8856,"butler, who said,--",2127
8857,"“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the",2128
8858,little copse.”,2128
8859,"Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,",2129
8860,"and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately",2129
8861,pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.,2129
8862,"Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as",2130
8863,"Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,",2130
8864,"came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--",2130
8865,"“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”",2131
8866,"“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”",2132
8867,"“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”",2133
8868,"“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from",2134
8869,his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”,2134
8870,Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.,2135
8871,"“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is",2136
8872,about.”,2136

8874,"“My dear Brother,",2138
8875,"     “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such",2139
8876,"     as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after",2139
8877,"     you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what",2139
8878,     part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet.,2139
8879,     It is enough to know they are discovered: I have seen them,2139

8885,"     Elizabeth read on: “I have seen them both. They are not married,",2144
8886,     nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are,2144
8887,     willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on,2144
8888,"     your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is",2144
8889,"     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her",2144
8890,"     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your",2144
8891,"     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,",2144
8892,"     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your",2144
8893,"     life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which,",2144
8894,"     considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as",2144
8895,"     far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by",2144
8896,"     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You",2144

8898,     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to,2144
8899,     be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to,2144
8900,"     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are",2144
8901,"     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.",2144
8902,"     If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act",2144

8910,     approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as,2144

8912,“EDW. GARDINER.”,2145
8913,"“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be",2146
8914,possible that he will marry her?”,2146
8915,"“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her",2147
8916,"sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”",2147
8917,“And have you answered the letter?” said Elizabeth.,2148
8918,“No; but it must be done soon.”,2149
8919,Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he,2150
8920,wrote.,2150
8921,"“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.",2151
8922,Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”,2151
8923,"“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble",2152
8924,yourself.”,2152
8925,"“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”",2153
8926,"And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.",2154
8927,"“And--may I ask?” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be",2155
8928,complied with.”,2155
8929,“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”,2156
8930,“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man.”,2157
8931,"“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there",2158
8932,"are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money",2158
8933,"your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever",2158
8934,to pay him.”,2158
8935,"“Money! my uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”",2159
8936,“I mean that no man in his proper senses would marry Lydia on so slight,2160
8937,"a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am",2160
8938,gone.”,2160
8939,"“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me",2161
8940,"before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,",2161
8941,"it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has",2161
8942,distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”,2161
8943,"“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing",2162
8944,"less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,",2162
8945,in the very beginning of our relationship.”,2162
8946,“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be,2163
8947,repaid?”,2163
8948,"Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued",2164
8949,silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the,2164
8950,"library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.",2164
8951,"“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they",2165
8952,were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be,2165
8953,"thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,",2165
8954,"and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”",2165
8955,"“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would",2166
8956,"not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind",2166
8957,"uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten",2166
8958,"thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children",2166
8959,"of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand",2166
8960,pounds?”,2166
8961,"“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said",2167
8962,"Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall",2167
8963,"exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has",2167
8964,not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be,2167
8965,"requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal",2167
8966,"protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as",2167
8967,years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is,2167
8968,"actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,",2167
8969,"she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she",2167
8970,first sees my aunt!”,2167
8971,"“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said",2168
8972,Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry,2168
8973,"her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of",2168
8974,thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself,2168
8975,"they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in",2168
8976,time make their past imprudence forgotten.”,2168
8977,"“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor",2169
8978,"I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”",2169
8979,It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood,2170
8980,"perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,",2170
8981,"therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make",2170
8982,"it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly",2170
8983,"replied,--",2170
8984,“Just as you please.”,2171
8985,“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”,2172
8986,"“Take whatever you like, and get away.”",2173
8987,"Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs",2174
8988,together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication,2174
8989,"would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,",2174
8990,the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As,2174
8991,"soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,",2174
8992,"her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its",2174
8993,exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she,2174
8994,had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter,2174
8995,would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her,2174
8996,"felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.",2174
8997,"“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will",2175
8998,be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My,2175
8999,"good, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage",2175
9000,everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the,2175
9001,"clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about",2175
9002,"them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how",2175
9003,"much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,",2175
9004,"Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear",2175
9005,Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”,2175
9006,Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of,2176
9007,"these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.",2176
9008,Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.,2176
9009,"“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great",2177
9010,measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to,2177
9011,assist Mr. Wickham with money.”,2177
9012,"“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but",2178
9013,"her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children",2178
9014,"must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have",2178
9015,ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.,2178
9016,"In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well",2178
9017,"it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in",2178
9018,"such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you",2178
9019,write for me. We will settle with your father about the money,2178
9020,afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”,2178
9021,"She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and",2179
9022,"cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had",2179
9023,"not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her",2179
9024,"father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,",2179
9025,would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite,2179
9026,"so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.",2179
9027,"“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the",2180
9028,"good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on",2180
9029,"Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An",2180
9030,"airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do",2180
9031,"anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you",2180
9032,heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall,2180
9033,all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”,2180
9034,Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her,2181
9035,"congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took",2181
9036,"refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s",2181
9037,"situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she",2181
9038,"had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,",2181
9039,"neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly",2181
9040,"expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only",2181
9041,"two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.",2181

9046,[Illustration],2193
9047,"Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,",2194
9048,"instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for",2194
9049,"the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived",2194
9050,him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that,2194
9051,"respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of",2194
9052,honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of,2194
9053,prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to,2194
9054,be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.,2194
9055,He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone,2195
9056,should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he,2195
9057,"was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,",2195
9058,and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.,2195
9059,"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly",2196
9060,"useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join",2196
9061,"in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow",2196
9062,and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters,2196
9063,"successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.",2196
9064,"Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he",2196
9065,"would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too",2196
9066,late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her,2196
9067,husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their,2196
9068,income.,2196
9069,Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and,2197
9070,the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the,2197
9071,"latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with",2197
9072,"regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet",2197
9073,could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In,2197
9074,"terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though",2197
9075,"expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect",2197
9076,"approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the",2197
9077,engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed,2197
9078,"that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be",2197
9079,done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present,2197
9080,"arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the",2197
9081,"hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket",2197
9082,"allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her",2197
9083,"through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within",2197
9084,that sum.,2197
9085,"That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was",2198
9086,another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have,2198
9087,as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports,2198
9088,"of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he",2198
9089,naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon,2198
9090,"despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in",2198
9091,its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was,2198
9092,indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any,2198
9093,message to her.,2198
9094,The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate,2199
9095,speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent,2199
9096,"philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of",2199
9097,"conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the",2199
9098,"happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant",2199
9099,"farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the",2199
9100,"good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from",2199
9101,"all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit",2199
9102,"in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery",2199
9103,was considered certain.,2199
9104,"It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this",2200
9105,"happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in",2200
9106,spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her,2200
9107,"triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of",2200
9108,"her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of",2200
9109,"accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those",2200
9110,"attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and",2200
9111,servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a,2200
9112,"proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering",2200
9113,"what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and",2200
9114,importance.,2200
9115,"“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the",2201
9116,"great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is",2201
9117,too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for,2201
9118,"Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”",2201
9119,Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the,2202
9120,"servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.",2202
9121,"Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and",2202
9122,"daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this",2202
9123,neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the,2202
9124,"imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”",2202
9125,A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it,2203
9126,"soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,",2203
9127,that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his,2203
9128,daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of,2203
9129,affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend,2203
9130,it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable,2203
9131,"resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her",2203
9132,"marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe",2203
9133,"possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new",2203
9134,"clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of",2203
9135,shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they,2203
9136,took place.,2203
9137,"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of",2204
9138,"the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for",2204
9139,her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper,2204
9140,"termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its",2204
9141,unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the,2204
9142,spot.,2204
9143,"She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were",2205
9144,few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;,2205
9145,but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s,2205
9146,"frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of",2205
9147,disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there,2205
9148,seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been,2205
9149,"concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that",2205
9150,"Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other",2205
9151,objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest,2205
9152,kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.,2205
9153,From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The,2206
9154,"wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his",2206
9155,"feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a",2206
9156,"blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she",2206
9157,"hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no",2206
9158,"longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there",2206
9159,seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that,2206
9160,"she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they",2206
9161,should meet.,2206
9162,"What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the",2207
9163,proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now,2207
9164,"have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she",2207
9165,"doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,",2207
9166,there must be a triumph.,2207
9167,"She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in",2208
9168,"disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and",2208
9169,"temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It",2208
9170,was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease,2208
9171,"and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;",2208
9172,"and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must",2208
9173,have received benefit of greater importance.,2208
9174,But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what,2209
9175,"connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and",2209
9176,"precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their",2209
9177,family.,2209
9178,How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she,2210
9179,could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to,2210
9180,a couple who were only brought together because their passions were,2210
9181,"stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.",2210
9182,Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s,2211
9183,"acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to",2211
9184,promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties,2211
9185,that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal,2211
9186,"purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved",2211
9187,on quitting the militia.,2211
9188,"“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his",2212
9189,"marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in",2212
9190,"considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his",2212
9191,account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the,2212
9192,"Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are",2212
9193,able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an,2212
9194,"ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is",2212
9195,an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He,2212
9196,"promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each",2212
9197,"have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have",2212
9198,"written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,",2212
9199,and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham,2212
9200,"in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have",2212
9201,pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying,2212
9202,"similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin",2212
9203,"a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I",2212
9204,"hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and",2212
9205,"all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,",2212
9206,unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.,2212
9207,Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she,2212
9208,"leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to",2212
9209,"you and her mother.--Yours, etc.",2212
9210,“E. GARDINER.”,2213
9211,Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s,2214
9212,"removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But",2214
9213,Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in,2214
9214,"the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her",2214
9215,"company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in",2214
9216,"Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a",2214
9217,pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted,2214
9218,"with everybody, and had so many favourites.",2214
9219,"“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking",2215
9220,"to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she",2215
9221,likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s,2215
9222,regiment.”,2215
9223,"His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being",2216
9224,"admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,",2216
9225,"received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who",2216
9226,"agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and",2216
9227,"consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,",2216
9228,"urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her",2216
9229,"and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was",2216
9230,"prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their",2216
9231,"mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show",2216
9232,"her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to",2216
9233,"the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he",2216
9234,"sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon",2216
9235,"as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth",2216
9236,"was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;",2216
9237,"and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him",2216
9238,would have been the last object of her wishes.,2216

9242,CHAPTER LI.,2226
9243,[Illustration],2228
9244,Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her,2229
9245,probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet,2229
9246,"them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival",2229
9247,"was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who",2229
9248,"gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_",2229
9249,"been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister",2229
9250,must endure.,2229
9251,They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive,2230
9252,"them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to",2230
9253,"the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,",2230
9254,"anxious, uneasy.",2230
9255,"Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and",2231
9256,"she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and",2231
9257,welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to,2231
9258,"Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an",2231
9259,alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.,2231
9260,"Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite",2232
9261,so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely,2232
9262,"opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was",2232
9263,enough to provoke him.,2232
9264,"Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was",2233
9265,"Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned",2233
9266,"from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at",2233
9267,"length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of",2233
9268,"some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a",2233
9269,great while since she had been there.,2233
9270,Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners,2234
9271,"were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been",2234
9272,"exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he",2234
9273,"claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth",2234
9274,had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat,2234
9275,"down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the",2234
9276,"impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the",2234
9277,cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of,2234
9278,colour.,2234
9279,There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither,2235
9280,"of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near",2235
9281,"Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,",2235
9282,"with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her",2235
9283,replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the,2235
9284,world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led,2235
9285,voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for,2235
9286,the world.,2235
9287,"“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:",2236
9288,"it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things",2236
9289,"enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure",2236
9290,I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I,2236
9291,thought it would be very good fun if I was.”,2236
9292,"Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked",2237
9293,"expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of",2237
9294,"which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--",2237
9295,"“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was",2238
9296,"afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,",2238
9297,"so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass",2238
9298,"next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the",2238
9299,"window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and",2238
9300,smiled like anything.”,2238
9301,Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;,2239
9302,"and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to",2239
9303,"the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with",2239
9304,"anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to",2239
9305,"her eldest sister,--",2239
9306,"“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a",2240
9307,married woman.”,2240
9308,It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,2241
9309,from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good,2241
9310,"spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all",2241
9311,"their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by",2241
9312,each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring,2241
9313,and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.,2241
9314,"“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the",2242
9315,"breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a",2242
9316,charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they,2242
9317,may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the,2242
9318,"place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”",2242
9319,"“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t",2243
9320,at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”,2243
9321,"“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.",2244
9322,"You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at",2244
9323,"Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I",2244
9324,will take care to get good partners for them all.”,2244
9325,“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.,2245
9326,"“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters",2246
9327,behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the,2246
9328,winter is over.”,2246
9329,"“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not",2247
9330,particularly like your way of getting husbands.”,2247
9331,Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham,2248
9332,"had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join",2248
9333,his regiment at the end of a fortnight.,2248
9334,No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and,2249
9335,"she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and",2249
9336,having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to,2249
9337,all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did,2249
9338,think than such as did not.,2249
9339,Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to,2250
9340,find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her,2250
9341,"present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that",2250
9342,their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather,2250
9343,"than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring",2250
9344,"for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain",2250
9345,that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and,2250
9346,"if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity",2250
9347,of having a companion.,2250
9348,Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every,2251
9349,occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did,2251
9350,everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds,2251
9351,on the first of September than anybody else in the country.,2251
9352,"One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two",2252
9353,"elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--",2252
9354,"“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were",2253
9355,"not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you",2253
9356,curious to hear how it was managed?”,2253
9357,"“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little",2254
9358,said on the subject.”,2254
9359,“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were,2255
9360,"married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in",2255
9361,that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven,2255
9362,o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others,2255
9363,were to meet us at the church.,2255
9364,"“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,",2256
9365,"you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should",2256
9366,"have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was",2256
9367,"dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a",2256
9368,"sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was",2256
9369,"thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether",2256
9370,he would be married in his blue coat.,2256
9371,"“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never",2257
9372,"be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt",2257
9373,were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe,2257
9374,"me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a",2257
9375,"fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was",2257
9376,"rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.",2257
9377,"“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was",2258
9378,"called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you",2258
9379,"know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so",2258
9380,"frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;",2258
9381,"and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,",2258
9382,"luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set",2258
9383,"out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented",2258
9384,"going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as",2258
9385,well.”,2258
9386,"“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.",2259
9387,"“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!",2260
9388,I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised,2260
9389,them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”,2260
9390,"“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the",2261
9391,subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”,2261
9392,"“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will",2262
9393,ask you no questions.”,2262
9394,"“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you",2263
9395,"all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”",2263
9396,"On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her",2264
9397,"power, by running away.",2264
9398,But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it,2265
9399,was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her,2265
9400,"sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,",2265
9401,"where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.",2265
9402,"Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her",2265
9403,"brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as",2265
9404,"placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She",2265
9405,"could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,",2265
9406,"wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what",2265
9407,"Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been",2265
9408,intended.,2265
9409,"“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to",2266
9410,"know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively",2266
9411,"speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such",2266
9412,"a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,",2266
9413,"for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to",2266
9414,think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with,2266
9415,ignorance.”,2266
9416,"“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the",2267
9417,"letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable",2267
9418,"manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it",2267
9419,out.”,2267
9420,Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to,2268
9421,Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of,2268
9422,it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any,2268
9423,"satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.",2268

9429,Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as,2280
9430,"soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it, than",2280
9431,"hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be",2280
9432,"interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be",2280
9433,happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not,2280
9434,contain a denial.,2280
9435,"     /* RIGHT “Gracechurch Street, _Sept. 6_. */",2281
9436,"“My dear Niece,",2282
9437,"     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole",2283
9438,"     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will",2283
9439,     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself,2283
9440,     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.,2283
9441,"     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,",2283
9442,     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_,2283
9443,"     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my",2283
9444,     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing,2283
9445,     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed,2283
9446,     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and,2283
9447,"     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming",2283
9448,"     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.",2283
9449,"     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all",2283
9450,     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked,2283
9451,     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he,2283
9452,"     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he",2283
9453,"     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.",2283
9454,"     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after",2283
9455,"     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for",2283
9456,     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to,2283
9457,     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as,2283
9458,     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or,2283
9459,     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken,2283
9460,"     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to",2283
9461,     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to,2283
9462,"     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step",2283
9463,"     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on",2283
9464,"     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never",2283
9465,     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to,2283
9466,"     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was",2283
9467,     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another,2283
9468,"     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a",2283
9469,"     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was",2283
9470,"     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though",2283
9471,"     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,",2283
9472,     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.,2283
9473,"     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he",2283
9474,"     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But",2283
9475,     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he,2283
9476,"     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery",2283
9477,"     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be",2283
9478,"     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in",2283
9479,"     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they",2283
9480,"     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our",2283
9481,     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----,2283
9482,"     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.",2283
9483,"     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade",2283
9484,"     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her",2283
9485,"     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,",2283
9486,     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia,2283
9487,     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none,2283
9488,     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of,2283
9489,     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or,2283
9490,"     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her",2283
9491,"     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a",2283
9492,"     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he",2283
9493,     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself,2283
9494,     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour,2283
9495,     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill,2283
9496,     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to,2283
9497,"     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,",2283
9498,"     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but",2283
9499,"     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live",2283
9500,     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.,2283
9501,"     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have",2283
9502,"     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been",2283
9503,"     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,",2283
9504,     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making,2283
9505,"     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such",2283
9506,"     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the",2283
9507,"     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there",2283
9508,"     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he",2283
9509,     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything,2283
9510,"     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make",2283
9511,"     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch",2283
9512,     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not,2283
9513,"     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father",2283
9514,"     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did",2283
9515,     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly,2283
9516,"     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him",2283
9517,"     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,",2283
9518,     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called,2283
9519,"     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your",2283
9520,"     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk",2283
9521,"     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It",2283
9522,"     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express",2283
9523,     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I,2283
9524,"     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,",2283
9525,     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;,2283
9526,     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not,2283
9527,"     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,",2283
9528,     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have,2283
9529,"     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which",2283
9530,     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it,2283
9531,"     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead",2283
9532,"     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up",2283
9533,"     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely",2283
9534,     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning,2283
9535,"     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that",2283
9536,"     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where",2283
9537,"     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or",2283
9538,"     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done",2283
9539,"     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I",2283
9540,"     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another",2283
9541,"     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his",2283
9542,     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him,2283
9543,"     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his",2283
9544,"     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character",2283
9545,"     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been",2283
9546,     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in,2283
9547,"     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_",2283
9548,     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this,2283
9549,"     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that",2283
9550,"     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit",2283
9551,     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved,2283
9552,"     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at",2283
9553,     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more,2283
9554,"     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to",2283
9555,     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.,2283
9556,     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I,2283
9557,     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to,2283
9558,"     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was",2283
9559,     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I,2283
9560,     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour,2283
9561,"     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter",2283
9562,"     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a",2283
9563,"     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no",2283
9564,"     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,",2283
9565,"     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all",2283
9566,"     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it",2283
9567,"     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes",2283
9568,"     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,",2283
9569,     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual,2283
9570,"     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He",2283
9571,"     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on",2283
9572,"     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear",2283
9573,"     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold",2283
9574,"     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,",2283
9575,"     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.",2283
9576,     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but,2283
9577,"     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his",2283
9578,     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever,2283
9579,     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive,2283
9580,"     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so",2283
9581,     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I,2283
9582,     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair,2283
9583,     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The,2283
9584,     children have been wanting me this half hour.,2283
9585,"“Yours, very sincerely,",2284
9586,“M. GARDINER.”,2285
9587,"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,",2287
9588,in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the,2287
9589,greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had,2287
9590,"produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her",2287
9591,"sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of",2287
9592,"goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be",2287
9593,"just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest",2287
9594,"extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken",2287
9595,on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a,2287
9596,research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he,2287
9597,"must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently",2287
9598,"meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always",2287
9599,"most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to",2287
9600,pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard,2287
9601,nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it,2287
9602,was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt,2287
9603,"that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his",2287
9604,"affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to",2287
9605,overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with,2287
9606,Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from,2287
9607,"the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think",2287
9608,"how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no",2287
9609,extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel,2287
9610,"he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising",2287
9611,"it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,",2287
9612,"she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might",2287
9613,assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be,2287
9614,"materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that",2287
9615,they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a,2287
9616,"return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to",2287
9617,"him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she",2287
9618,"had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards",2287
9619,"him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that",2287
9620,in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better,2287
9621,of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and,2287
9622,again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible,2287
9623,"of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly",2287
9624,both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence,2287
9625,subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.,2287
9626,"She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;",2288
9627,"and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by",2288
9628,Wickham.,2288
9629,"“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,",2289
9630,as he joined her.,2289
9631,"“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow",2290
9632,that the interruption must be unwelcome.”,2290
9633,"“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,",2291
9634,and now we are better.”,2291
9635,“True. Are the others coming out?”,2292
9636,“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to,2293
9637,"Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that",2293
9638,you have actually seen Pemberley.”,2293
9639,She replied in the affirmative.,2294
9640,"“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much",2295
9641,"for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the",2295
9642,"old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of",2295
9643,me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”,2295
9644,"“Yes, she did.”",2296
9645,“And what did she say?”,2297
9646,"“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned",2298
9647,"out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely",2298
9648,misrepresented.”,2298
9649,"“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had",2299
9650,"silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--",2299
9651,“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other,2300
9652,several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”,2300
9653,"“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said",2301
9654,Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this,2301
9655,time of year.”,2301
9656,“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I,2302
9657,understood from the Gardiners that you had.”,2302
9658,“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”,2303
9659,“And do you like her?”,2304
9660,“Very much.”,2305
9661,"“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year",2306
9662,"or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad",2306
9663,you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”,2306
9664,“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”,2307
9665,“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”,2308
9666,“I do not recollect that we did.”,2309
9667,“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most,2310
9668,delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in,2310
9669,every respect.”,2310
9670,“How should you have liked making sermons?”,2311
9671,"“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and",2312
9672,"the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,",2312
9673,"to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the",2312
9674,"retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of",2312
9675,happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the,2312
9676,circumstance when you were in Kent?”,2312
9677,"“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was",2313
9678,"left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”",2313
9679,"“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the",2314
9680,"first, you may remember.”",2314
9681,"“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so",2315
9682,palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually,2315
9683,"declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business",2315
9684,had been compromised accordingly.”,2315
9685,“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember,2316
9686,"what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”",2316
9687,"They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast",2317
9688,"to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,",2317
9689,"she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--",2317
9690,"“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us",2318
9691,"quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one",2318
9692,mind.”,2318
9693,"She held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though",2319
9694,"he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.",2319

9698,CHAPTER LIII.,2328
9699,[Illustration],2330
9700,"Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he",2331
9701,"never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,",2331
9702,by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she,2331
9703,had said enough to keep him quiet.,2331
9704,The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was,2332
9705,"forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means",2332
9706,"entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to",2332
9707,continue at least a twelvemonth.,2332
9708,"“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”",2333
9709,"“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”",2334
9710,"“Write to me very often, my dear.”",2335
9711,“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for,2336
9712,writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to,2336
9713,do.”,2336
9714,Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He,2337
9715,"smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.",2337
9716,"“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of",2338
9717,"the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us",2338
9718,all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas,2338
9719,himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”,2338
9720,The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.,2339
9721,"“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with",2340
9722,one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”,2340
9723,"“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said",2341
9724,Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are,2341
9725,single.”,2341
9726,“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;,2342
9727,but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If,2342
9728,"that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”",2342
9729,But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly,2343
9730,"relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an",2343
9731,article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper,2343
9732,at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her,2343
9733,"master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several",2343
9734,"weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and",2343
9735,"smiled, and shook her head, by turns.",2343
9736,"“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.",2344
9737,"Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that",2344
9738,"I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I",2344
9739,"never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to",2344
9740,"Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that",2344
9741,"is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention",2344
9742,"a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”",2344
9743,"“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in",2345
9744,"Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose",2345
9745,to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He,2345
9746,"comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was",2345
9747,"going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on",2345
9748,"Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”",2345
9749,Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing,2346
9750,colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to,2346
9751,"Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--",2346
9752,"“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present",2347
9753,report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from,2347
9754,"any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that",2347
9755,I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect,2347
9756,"me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes",2347
9757,alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of,2347
9758,"_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”",2347
9759,Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in,2348
9760,"Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no",2348
9761,other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial,2348
9762,"to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming",2348
9763,"there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come",2348
9764,without it.,2348
9765,"“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come",2349
9766,"to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this",2349
9767,speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”,2349
9768,"In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her",2350
9769,"feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily",2350
9770,"perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,",2350
9771,"more unequal, than she had often seen them.",2350
9772,"The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,",2351
9773,"about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.",2351
9774,"“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you",2352
9775,"will wait on him, of course.”",2352
9776,"“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I",2353
9777,"went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in",2353
9778,"nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”",2353
9779,His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention,2354
9780,"would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to",2354
9781,Netherfield.,2354
9782,"“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let",2355
9783,him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in,2355
9784,running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back,2355
9785,again.”,2355
9786,"“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait",2356
9787,"on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I",2356
9788,am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will,2356
9789,"make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for",2356
9790,him.”,2356
9791,"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her",2357
9792,husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her,2357
9793,"neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before",2357
9794,"_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--",2357
9795,"“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It",2358
9796,would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can,2358
9797,hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;,2358
9798,"but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she",2358
9799,says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”,2358
9800,"“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it",2359
9801,is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction,2359
9802,"of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have",2359
9803,always so much.”,2359
9804,"Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,",2360
9805,"contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety",2360
9806,and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days,2360
9807,that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of,2360
9808,seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in,2360
9809,"Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the",2360
9810,"paddock, and ride towards the house.",2360
9811,Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely,2361
9812,"kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went",2361
9813,"to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down",2361
9814,again by her sister.,2361
9815,"“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”",2362
9816,"“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not",2363
9817,know.”,2363
9818,"“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with",2364
9819,"him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”",2364
9820,"“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of",2365
9821,"Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must",2365
9822,say that I hate the very sight of him.”,2365
9823,Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little,2366
9824,"of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness",2366
9825,"which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time",2366
9826,after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable,2366
9827,"enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their",2366
9828,"mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be",2366
9829,"civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either",2366
9830,of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be,2366
9831,"suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.",2366
9832,"Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards",2366
9833,"him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,",2366
9834,and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive,2366
9835,"information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted",2366
9836,"for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an",2366
9837,"interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as",2366
9838,what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his,2366
9839,"coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,",2366
9840,was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered,2366
9841,behaviour in Derbyshire.,2366
9842,The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a,2367
9843,"minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to",2367
9844,"her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and",2367
9845,wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.,2367
9846,"“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early",2368
9847,enough for expectation.”,2368
9848,"She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to",2369
9849,"lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her",2369
9850,sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little,2369
9851,"paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the",2369
9852,"gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with",2369
9853,"tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any",2369
9854,"symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.",2369
9855,"Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down",2370
9856,"again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She",2370
9857,"had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,",2370
9858,"she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as",2370
9859,"she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her",2370
9860,mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a,2370
9861,"painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.",2370
9862,"Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period",2371
9863,saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.,2371
9864,"Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,",2371
9865,especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of,2371
9866,her courtesy and address of his friend.,2371
9867,"Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the",2372
9868,"preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was",2372
9869,hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill,2372
9870,applied.,2372
9871,"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question",2373
9872,which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He,2373
9873,was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but,2373
9874,it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,2373
9875,"when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without",2373
9876,"bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist",2373
9877,"the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often",2373
9878,"found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but",2373
9879,"the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when",2373
9880,"they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry",2373
9881,with herself for being so.,2373
9882,“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”,2374
9883,She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to,2375
9884,him she had hardly courage to speak.,2375
9885,"She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.",2376
9886,"“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.",2377
9887,He readily agreed to it.,2378
9888,"“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,",2379
9889,"you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope",2379
9890,it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,2379
9891,since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my,2379
9892,"own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have",2379
9893,"seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;",2379
9894,"though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,",2379
9895,"George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a",2379
9896,"syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.",2379
9897,"It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came",2379
9898,to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”,2379
9899,"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth",2380
9900,"dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could",2380
9901,not tell.,2380
9902,"“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”",2381
9903,"continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very",2381
9904,"hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a",2381
9905,"place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not",2381
9906,know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of,2381
9907,"his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.",2381
9908,"Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he",2381
9909,deserves.”,2381
9910,"Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery",2382
9911,"of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,",2382
9912,"the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done",2382
9913,before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the,2382
9914,"country at present. A few weeks, he believed.",2382
9915,"“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,",2383
9916,“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.,2383
9917,"Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and",2383
9918,will save all the best of the coveys for you.”,2383
9919,"Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious",2384
9920,"attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had",2384
9921,"flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be",2384
9922,"hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,",2384
9923,that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for,2384
9924,moments of such painful confusion.,2384
9925,"“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be",2385
9926,in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,2385
9927,that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either,2385
9928,one or the other again!”,2385
9929,"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no",2386
9930,"compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing",2386
9931,how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former,2386
9932,"lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every",2386
9933,five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her,2386
9934,"as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as",2386
9935,"unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no",2386
9936,"difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded",2386
9937,"that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,",2386
9938,that she did not always know when she was silent.,2386
9939,"When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her",2387
9940,"intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at",2387
9941,Longbourn in a few days’ time.,2387
9942,"“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when",2388
9943,"you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with",2388
9944,"us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you",2388
9945,I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your,2388
9946,engagement.”,2388
9947,"Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of",2389
9948,his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.,2389
9949,Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine,2390
9950,"there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did",2390
9951,not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man,2390
9952,"on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride",2390
9953,of one who had ten thousand a year.,2390
9954,[Illustration:,2394

9957,CHAPTER LIV.,2399
9958,[Illustration],2401
9959,"As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;",2402
9960,"or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects",2402
9961,which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed,2402
9962,her.,2402
9963,"“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,",2403
9964,“did he come at all?”,2403
9965,She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.,2404
9966,"“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he",2405
9967,"was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he",2405
9968,"no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think",2405
9969,no more about him.”,2405
9970,Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach,2406
9971,"of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her",2406
9972,better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.,2406
9973,"“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly",2407
9974,"easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by",2407
9975,his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly,2407
9976,"seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent",2407
9977,acquaintance.”,2407
9978,"“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!",2408
9979,take care.”,2408
9980,"“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”",2409
9981,“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with,2410
9982,you as ever.”,2410
9983,"They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in",2411
9984,"the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the",2411
9985,"good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,",2411
9986,had revived.,2411
9987,On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,2412
9988,"who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as",2412
9989,"sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the",2412
9990,"dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take",2412
9991,"the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by",2412
9992,"her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to",2412
9993,"invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to",2412
9994,"hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was",2412
9995,decided. He placed himself by her.,2412
9996,"Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He",2413
9997,bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that,2413
9998,"Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes",2413
9999,"likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing",2413
10000,alarm.,2413
10001,His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an,2414
10002,"admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded",2414
10003,"Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his",2414
10004,"own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the",2414
10005,"consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It",2414
10006,gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in,2414
10007,no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table,2414
10008,could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little,2414
10009,"such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to",2414
10010,advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but,2414
10011,"she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and",2414
10012,cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,2414
10013,made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;,2414
10014,"and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell",2414
10015,"him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of",2414
10016,the family.,2414
10017,She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of,2415
10018,bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away,2415
10019,"without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,",2415
10020,than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and,2415
10021,"uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen",2415
10022,"came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.",2415
10023,She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her,2415
10024,chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.,2415
10025,"“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for",2416
10026,ever.”,2416
10027,The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have,2417
10028,"answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,",2417
10029,"where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,",2417
10030,"in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her",2417
10031,"which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of",2417
10032,"the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--",2417
10033,"“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;",2418
10034,do we?”,2418
10035,Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with,2419
10036,"her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough",2419
10037,"to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for",2419
10038,being so silly!,2419
10039,“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to,2420
10040,expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not,2420
10041,protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?,2420
10042,There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”,2420
10043,"She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup",2421
10044,"himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--",2421
10045,“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”,2422
10046,“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”,2423
10047,“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”,2424
10048,“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,2425
10049,these three weeks.”,2425
10050,She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse,2426
10051,"with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for",2426
10052,"some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering",2426
10053,"to Elizabeth again, he walked away.",2426
10054,"When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies",2427
10055,"all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when",2427
10056,"all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her",2427
10057,"mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated",2427
10058,with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.,2427
10059,They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had,2427
10060,"nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side",2427
10061,"of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.",2427
10062,Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to,2428
10063,"supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the",2428
10064,"others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.",2428
10065,"“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what",2429
10066,"say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I",2429
10067,assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The,2429
10068,"venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat",2429
10069,a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the,2429
10070,Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges,2429
10071,were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French,2429
10072,"cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater",2429
10073,"beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And",2429
10074,"what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her",2429
10075,"at Netherfield at last!’ She did, indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as",2429
10076,good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved,2429
10077,"girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”",2429

10080,],2431
10081,"Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of",2432
10082,Bingley’s behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at,2432
10083,"last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy",2432
10084,"humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at",2432
10085,"not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.",2432
10086,"“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The",2433
10087,"party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we",2433
10088,may often meet again.”,2433
10089,Elizabeth smiled.,2434
10090,"“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I",2435
10091,assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an,2435
10092,agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am,2435
10093,"perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had",2435
10094,any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with,2435
10095,"greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally",2435
10096,"pleasing, than any other man.”",2435
10097,"“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and",2436
10098,are provoking me to it every moment.”,2436
10099,“How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in,2437
10100,others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I,2437
10101,acknowledge?”,2437
10102,“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to,2438
10103,"instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive",2438
10104,"me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your",2438

10110,[Illustration],2449
10111,"A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His",2450
10112,"friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in",2450
10113,"ten days’ time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably",2450
10114,"good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many",2450
10115,"expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.",2450
10116,"“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”",2451
10117,"He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she",2452
10118,"would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on",2452
10119,them.,2452
10120,“Can you come to-morrow?”,2453
10121,"Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was",2454
10122,accepted with alacrity.,2454
10123,"He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them",2455
10124,"dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her",2455
10125,"dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--",2455
10126,"“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is",2456
10127,"come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss",2456
10128,"Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss",2456
10129,Lizzy’s hair.”,2456
10130,"“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is",2457
10131,"forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”",2457
10132,"“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!",2458
10133,"where is your sash, my dear?”",2458
10134,"But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down",2459
10135,without one of her sisters.,2459
10136,The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the,2460
10137,"evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his",2460
10138,"custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the",2460
10139,"five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at",2460
10140,"Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any",2460
10141,impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last,2460
10142,"Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do",2460
10143,you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”,2460
10144,"“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still",2461
10145,"five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she",2461
10146,"suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--",2461
10147,"“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.",2462
10148,Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such,2462
10149,"premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a",2462
10150,"few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--",2462
10151,"“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”",2463
10152,Elizabeth was forced to go.,2464
10153,"“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as",2465
10154,soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in,2465
10155,my dressing-room.”,2465
10156,"Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained",2466
10157,"quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned",2466
10158,into the drawing-room.,2466
10159,Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was,2467
10160,"everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her",2467
10161,daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable,2467
10162,addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged,2467
10163,"officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a",2467
10164,forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the,2467
10165,daughter.,2467
10166,He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away,2468
10167,"an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s",2468
10168,"means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.",2468
10169,"After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed",2469
10170,between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the,2469
10171,"happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy",2469
10172,"returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably",2469
10173,persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s,2469
10174,concurrence.,2469
10175,Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the,2470
10176,"morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more",2470
10177,agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption,2470
10178,"or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into",2470
10179,"silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the",2470
10180,other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;,2470
10181,and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get,2470
10182,"everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to",2470
10183,"write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for",2470
10184,"as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be",2470
10185,wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.,2470
10186,"But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,",2471
10187,"she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her",2471
10188,"mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she",2471
10189,"perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as",2471
10190,"if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,",2471
10191,"the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each",2471
10192,"other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but",2471
10193,_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by,2471
10194,"either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when",2471
10195,"Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,",2471
10196,"whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.",2471
10197,"Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give",2472
10198,"pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest",2472
10199,"emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.",2472
10200,"“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,",2473
10201,why is not everybody as happy?”,2473
10202,"Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a",2474
10203,"delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of",2474
10204,kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not,2474
10205,"allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be",2474
10206,"said, for the present.",2474
10207,"“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any",2475
10208,"account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it",2475
10209,"from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to",2475
10210,know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear,2475
10211,family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”,2475
10212,"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the",2476
10213,"card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.",2476
10214,"Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease",2477
10215,"with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many",2477
10216,previous months of suspense and vexation.,2477
10217,"“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious",2478
10218,circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the,2478
10219,"happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”",2478
10220,"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her",2479
10221,father had been short and to the purpose.,2479
10222,"“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.",2480
10223,"“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”",2481
10224,"He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes",2482
10225,and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her,2482
10226,delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with,2482
10227,"great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen",2482
10228,"to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;",2482
10229,"and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his",2482
10230,"expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for",2482
10231,basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of,2482
10232,"Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and",2482
10233,himself.,2482
10234,It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of,2483
10235,"Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as",2483
10236,"made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped",2483
10237,"her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or",2483
10238,"speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,",2483
10239,"though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when",2483
10240,"Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed",2483
10241,how really happy he was.,2483
10242,"Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their",2484
10243,"visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he",2484
10244,"turned to his daughter and said,--",2484
10245,"“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”",2485
10246,"Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his",2486
10247,goodness.,2486
10248,"“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in",2487
10249,thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your,2487
10250,doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are,2487
10251,"each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so",2487
10252,"easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will",2487
10253,always exceed your income.”,2487
10254,“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be,2488
10255,unpardonable in _me_.”,2488
10256,"“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you",2489
10257,"talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely",2489
10258,"more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so",2489
10259,happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it,2489
10260,"would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not",2489
10261,"be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when",2489
10262,"he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was",2489
10263,"that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that",2489
10264,ever was seen!”,2489
10265,"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her",2490
10266,favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger,2490
10267,sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness,2490
10268,which she might in future be able to dispense.,2490
10269,Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty,2491
10270,begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.,2491
10271,"Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;",2492
10272,"coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after",2492
10273,"supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough",2492
10274,"detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought",2492
10275,himself obliged to accept.,2492
10276,Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for,2493
10277,while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but,2493
10278,"she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of",2493
10279,"separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always",2493
10280,attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and,2493
10281,"when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.",2493
10282,"“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he",2494
10283,was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed,2494
10284,it possible.”,2494
10285,"“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for",2495
10286,it?”,2495
10287,“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to,2496
10288,"his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have",2496
10289,"chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,",2496
10290,"as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will",2496
10291,"learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we",2496
10292,can never be what we once were to each other.”,2496
10293,"“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever",2497
10294,"heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again",2497
10295,the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”,2497
10296,"“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he",2498
10297,"really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent",2498
10298,would have prevented his coming down again?”,2498
10299,"“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his",2499
10300,modesty.”,2499
10301,"This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and",2500
10302,the little value he put on his own good qualities.,2500
10303,Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference,2501
10304,"of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving",2501
10305,"heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice",2501
10306,her against him.,2501
10307,“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried,2502
10308,"Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed",2502
10309,above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such,2502
10310,another man for you!”,2502
10311,“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.,2503
10312,"Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your",2503
10313,"happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very",2503
10314,"good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”",2503
10315,The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a,2504
10316,"secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and",2504
10317,"she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her",2504
10318,neighbours in Meryton.,2504
10319,The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the,2505
10320,"world; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,",2505
10321,they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.,2505
10322,[Illustration],2509
10323,CHAPTER LVI.,2513
10324,[Illustration],2515
10325,"One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been",2516
10326,"formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the",2516
10327,"dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the",2516
10328,sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the,2516
10329,"lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the",2516
10330,equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses,2516
10331,"were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who",2516
10332,"preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that",2516
10333,"somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid",2516
10334,"the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the",2516
10335,shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three,2516
10336,"continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown",2516
10337,"open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.",2516
10338,They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their,2517
10339,astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.,2517
10340,"Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even",2517
10341,inferior to what Elizabeth felt.,2517
10342,"She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no",2518
10343,other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the,2518
10344,"head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her",2518
10345,"name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of",2518
10346,introduction had been made.,2518
10347,"Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such",2519
10348,"high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting",2519
10349,"for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--",2519
10350,"“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your",2520
10351,mother?”,2520
10352,Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.,2521
10353,"“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”",2522
10354,"“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.",2523
10355,"“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,",2523
10356,"and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,",2523
10357,"who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”",2523
10358,"“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a",2524
10359,short silence.,2524
10360,"“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I",2525
10361,"assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”",2525
10362,“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in,2526
10363,summer: the windows are full west.”,2526
10364,Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then,2527
10365,"added,--",2527
10366,“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and,2528
10367,Mrs. Collins well?”,2528
10368,"“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”",2529
10369,Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from,2530
10370,"Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no",2530
10371,"letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.",2530
10372,"Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some",2531
10373,"refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,",2531
10374,"declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--",2531
10375,"“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness",2532
10376,"on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you",2532
10377,will favour me with your company.”,2532
10378,"“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the",2533
10379,different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”,2533
10380,"Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,",2534
10381,"attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,",2534
10382,Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and,2534
10383,"drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be",2534
10384,"decent-looking rooms, walked on.",2534
10385,"Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her",2535
10386,waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk,2535
10387,that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for,2535
10388,conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and,2535
10389,disagreeable.,2535
10390,[Illustration:,2536
10391,“After a short survey”,2537
10392,[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]],2538
10393,"“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in",2539
10394,her face.,2539
10395,"As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following",2540
10396,manner:--,2540
10397,"“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my",2541
10398,"journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I",2541
10399,come.”,2541
10400,Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.,2542
10401,"“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account",2543
10402,for the honour of seeing you here.”,2543
10403,"“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to",2544
10404,know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may,2544
10405,"choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been",2544
10406,celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such,2544
10407,"moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most",2544
10408,"alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your",2544
10409,"sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that",2544
10410,"_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon",2544
10411,"afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I",2544
10412,"_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him",2544
10413,"so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on",2544
10414,"setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to",2544
10415,you.”,2544
10416,"“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring",2545
10417,"with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming",2545
10418,so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”,2545
10419,“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”,2546
10420,"“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth",2547
10421,"coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report",2547
10422,is in existence.”,2547
10423,“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been,2548
10424,industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a,2548
10425,report is spread abroad?”,2548
10426,“I never heard that it was.”,2549
10427,"“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”",2550
10428,“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_,2551
10429,may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”,2551
10430,"“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has",2552
10431,"he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”",2552
10432,“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”,2553
10433,"“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his",2554
10434,"reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,",2554
10435,have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You,2554
10436,may have drawn him in.”,2554
10437,"“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”",2555
10438,"“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such",2556
10439,"language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,",2556
10440,and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”,2556
10441,“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as,2557
10442,this ever induce me to be explicit.”,2557
10443,"“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the",2558
10444,"presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is",2558
10445,"engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”",2558
10446,"“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will",2559
10447,make an offer to me.”,2559
10448,"Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--",2560
10449,"“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,",2561
10450,they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of,2561
10451,"_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the",2561
10452,"union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be",2561
10453,"accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of",2561
10454,"inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to",2561
10455,the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his,2561
10456,tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of,2561
10457,"propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his",2561
10458,earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”,2561
10459,“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no,2562
10460,"other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be",2562
10461,kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry,2562
10462,Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the,2562
10463,marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by,2562
10464,"honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make",2562
10465,"another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”",2562
10466,"“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss",2563
10467,"Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or",2563
10468,"friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will",2563
10469,"be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.",2563
10470,Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned,2563
10471,by any of us.”,2563
10472,"“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.",2564
10473,Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily,2564
10474,"attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause",2564
10475,to repine.”,2564
10476,"“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude",2565
10477,for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that,2565
10478,"score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came",2565
10479,here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I,2565
10480,be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s,2565
10481,whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”,2565
10482,“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;,2566
10483,but it will have no effect on _me_.”,2566
10484,“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my,2567
10485,"nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal",2567
10486,"side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,",2567
10487,"honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on",2567
10488,both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of,2567
10489,every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide,2567
10490,"them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,",2567
10491,"connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall",2567
10492,"not be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to",2567
10493,quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”,2567
10494,"“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that",2568
10495,sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are,2568
10496,equal.”,2568
10497,“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But what was your mother? Who,2569
10498,are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their,2569
10499,condition.”,2569
10500,"“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does",2570
10501,"not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”",2570
10502,"“Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”",2571
10503,"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady",2572
10504,"Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a",2572
10505,"moment’s deliberation,--",2572
10506,“I am not.”,2573
10507,Lady Catherine seemed pleased.,2574
10508,“And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”,2575
10509,“I will make no promise of the kind.”,2576
10510,"“Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more",2577
10511,reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I,2577
10512,will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the,2577
10513,assurance I require.”,2577
10514,“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into,2578
10515,anything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry,2578
10516,your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make,2578
10517,_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to,2578
10518,"me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on",2578
10519,"his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with",2578
10520,which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as,2578
10521,frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my,2578
10522,"character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.",2578
10523,"How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,",2578
10524,I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in,2578
10525,"mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the",2578
10526,subject.”,2578
10527,"“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the",2579
10528,objections I have already urged I have still another to add. I am no,2579
10529,stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous,2579
10530,elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a,2579
10531,"patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is",2579
10532,"_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son",2579
10533,"of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of",2579
10534,what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”,2579
10535,"“You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.",2580
10536,"“You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to",2580
10537,the house.”,2580
10538,"And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned",2581
10539,back. Her Ladyship was highly incensed.,2581
10540,"“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!",2582
10541,"Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you",2582
10542,must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”,2582
10543,"“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”",2583
10544,“You are then resolved to have him?”,2584
10545,"“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,",2585
10546,"which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without",2585
10547,"reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”",2585
10548,"“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the",2586
10549,"claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in",2586
10550,"the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”",2586
10551,"“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any",2587
10552,"possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either",2587
10553,would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the,2587
10554,"resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former",2587
10555,"_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s",2587
10556,concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in,2587
10557,the scorn.”,2587
10558,“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I,2588
10559,"shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your",2588
10560,ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you,2588
10561,reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.”,2588
10562,In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of,2589
10563,"the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--",2589
10564,"“I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your",2590
10565,mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”,2590
10566,Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her,2591
10567,"Ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She",2591
10568,heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother,2591
10569,"impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why Lady",2591
10570,Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.,2591
10571,"“She did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”",2592
10572,“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously,2593
10573,"civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.",2593
10574,"She is on her road somewhere, I dare say; and so, passing through",2593
10575,"Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had",2593
10576,"nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”",2593
10577,Elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to,2594
10578,acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.,2594

10584,The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw,2606
10585,Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many,2606
10586,"hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it",2606
10587,"appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings",2606
10588,for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.,2606
10589,"Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of",2606
10590,"their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;",2606
10591,"till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,",2606
10592,"and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the",2606
10593,"expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply",2606
10594,the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her,2606
10595,sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at,2606
10596,"Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the",2606
10597,"Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had",2606
10598,only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had,2606
10599,looked forward to as possible at some future time.,2606
10600,"In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help",2607
10601,feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting,2607
10602,in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to,2607
10603,"prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an",2607
10604,application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar,2607
10605,representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared,2607
10606,not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his,2607
10607,"aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose",2607
10608,that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it,2607
10609,"was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_",2607
10610,"whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would",2607
10611,"address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would",2607
10612,"probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak",2607
10613,"and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.",2607
10614,"If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often",2608
10615,"seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might",2608
10616,"settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity",2608
10617,unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady,2608
10618,Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to,2608
10619,Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.,2608
10620,"“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his",2609
10621,"friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand",2609
10622,"it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his",2609
10623,"constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might",2609
10624,"have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him",2609
10625,at all.”,2609
10626,"The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had",2610
10627,"been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same",2610
10628,kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and,2610
10629,Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.,2610
10630,"The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her",2611
10631,"father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.",2611
10632,"“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”",2612
10633,She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell,2613
10634,her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner,2613
10635,connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might,2613
10636,"be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the",2613
10637,consequent explanations.,2613
10638,"She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He",2614
10639,"then said,--",2614
10640,“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me,2615
10641,"exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its",2615
10642,contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink,2615
10643,of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”,2615
10644,The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous,2616
10645,"conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;",2616
10646,and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained,2616
10647,"himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to",2616
10648,"herself, when her father continued,--",2616
10649,“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters,2617
10650,as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the,2617
10651,name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”,2617
10652,“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”,2618
10653,"“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with",2619
10654,"congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of",2619
10655,"which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping",2619
10656,Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says,2619
10657,on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus,2619
10658,offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on,2619
10659,"this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,",2619
10660,of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter,2619
10661,"Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after",2619
10662,her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate,2619
10663,may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages,2619
10664,"in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?",2619
10665,"‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the",2619
10666,"heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and",2619
10667,"extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn",2619
10668,"my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a",2619
10669,"precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,",2619
10670,"you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,",2619
10671,"Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for",2619
10672,"cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,",2619
10673,"Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly",2619
10674,"eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_",2619
10675,"surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within",2619
10676,"the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more",2619
10677,"effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any",2619
10678,"woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in",2619
10679,his life! It is admirable!”,2619
10680,"Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force",2620
10681,one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so,2620
10682,little agreeable to her.,2620
10683,“Are you not diverted?”,2621
10684,"“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”",2622
10685,“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last,2623
10686,"night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she",2623
10687,"felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of",2623
10688,"some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give",2623
10689,her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my,2623
10690,"duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she",2623
10691,"and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run",2623
10692,hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.,2623
10693,"Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad",2623
10694,"business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their",2623
10695,living together before the marriage took place should be so generally,2623
10696,"known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain",2623
10697,"from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young",2623
10698,couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an,2623
10699,"encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should",2623
10700,very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as,2623
10701,"a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their",2623
10702,names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of,2623
10703,Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear,2623
10704,"Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,",2623
10705,"Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be",2623
10706,"_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For",2623
10707,"what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them",2623
10708,in our turn?”,2623
10709,"“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so",2624
10710,strange!”,2624
10711,"“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man",2625
10712,it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_,2625
10713,pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate,2625
10714,"writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any",2625
10715,"consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving",2625
10716,"him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and",2625
10717,"hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine",2625
10718,about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”,2625
10719,To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had,2626
10720,"been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his",2626
10721,repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her,2626
10722,feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she,2626
10723,would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by,2626
10724,what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but,2626
10725,"wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of",2626
10726,"his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.",2626

10730,CHAPTER LVIII.,2636
10731,[Illustration],2638
10732,"Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as",2639
10733,"Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy",2639
10734,with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s,2639
10735,"visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to",2639
10736,"tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in",2639
10737,"momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed",2639
10738,their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the,2639
10739,"habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five",2639
10740,"set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to",2639
10741,"outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy",2639
10742,were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was,2639
10743,too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a,2639
10744,"desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.",2639
10745,"They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon",2640
10746,"Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,",2640
10747,when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the,2640
10748,moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was,2640
10749,"high, she immediately said,--",2640
10750,"“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving",2641
10751,relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I,2641
10752,can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor,2641
10753,sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to,2641
10754,acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest,2641
10755,of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”,2641
10756,"“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise",2642
10757,"and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a",2642
10758,"mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner",2642
10759,was so little to be trusted.”,2642
10760,“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to,2643
10761,"me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could",2643
10762,"not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,",2643
10763,"in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced",2643
10764,"you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the",2643
10765,sake of discovering them.”,2643
10766,"“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.",2644
10767,That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other,2644
10768,"inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your",2644
10769,"_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought",2644
10770,only of _you_.”,2644
10771,"Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,",2645
10772,"her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your",2645
10773,"feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_",2645
10774,affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence,2645
10775,me on this subject for ever.”,2645
10776,"Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of",2646
10777,"his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not",2646
10778,"very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone",2646
10779,"so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make",2646
10780,her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The,2646
10781,happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never,2646
10782,felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as,2646
10783,warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth,2646
10784,"been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the",2646
10785,expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but,2646
10786,though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings,2646
10787,"which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection",2646
10788,every moment more valuable.,2646
10789,They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to,2647
10790,"be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She",2647
10791,soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding,2647
10792,"to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through",2647
10793,"London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the",2647
10794,substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on,2647
10795,"every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,",2647
10796,"peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that",2647
10797,such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from,2647
10798,"her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her",2647
10799,"Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.",2647
10800,"“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself",2648
10801,"to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that",2648
10802,"had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have",2648
10803,acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”,2648
10804,"Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of",2649
10805,my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so,2649
10806,"abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all",2649
10807,your relations.”,2649
10808,“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your,2650
10809,"accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour",2650
10810,to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was,2650
10811,unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”,2650
10812,“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that,2651
10813,"evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly",2651
10814,"examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,",2651
10815,improved in civility.”,2651
10816,“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I,2652
10817,"then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of",2652
10818,"it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your",2652
10819,"reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a",2652
10820,"more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can",2652
10821,"scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I",2652
10822,"confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”",2652
10823,“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an,2653
10824,impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such,2653
10825,a way.”,2653
10826,“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper,2654
10827,"feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never",2654
10828,"forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible",2654
10829,way that would induce you to accept me.”,2654
10830,"“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at",2655
10831,all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”,2655
10832,"Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you",2656
10833,"think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its",2656
10834,contents?”,2656
10835,"She explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all",2657
10836,her former prejudices had been removed.,2657
10837,"“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was",2658
10838,"necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,",2658
10839,"especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power",2658
10840,of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly,2658
10841,make you hate me.”,2658
10842,"“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the",2659
10843,"preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my",2659
10844,"opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily",2659
10845,changed as that implies.”,2659
10846,"“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly",2660
10847,calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a,2660
10848,dreadful bitterness of spirit.”,2660
10849,"“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The",2661
10850,adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings,2661
10851,of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely,2661
10852,"different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance",2661
10853,attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my,2661
10854,philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you,2661
10855,pleasure.”,2661
10856,“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_,2662
10857,"retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment",2662
10858,"arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of",2662
10859,"ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will",2662
10860,"intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a",2662
10861,"selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a",2662
10862,"child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my",2662
10863,"temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride",2662
10864,"and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),",2662
10865,"I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father",2662
10866,"particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,",2662
10867,"almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond",2662
10868,"my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to",2662
10869,_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with,2662
10870,"my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might",2662
10871,"still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not",2662
10872,"owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most",2662
10873,"advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a",2662
10874,doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my,2662
10875,pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”,2662
10876,“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”,2663
10877,“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be,2664
10878,"wishing, expecting my addresses.”",2664
10879,"“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure",2665
10880,"you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me",2665
10881,wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”,2665
10882,"“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to",2666
10883,take a proper direction.”,2666
10884,“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at,2667
10885,Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”,2667
10886,"“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”",2668
10887,“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.,2669
10888,"My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I",2669
10889,confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”,2669
10890,"“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility",2670
10891,"in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped",2670
10892,"to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you",2670
10893,see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes,2670
10894,"introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half",2670
10895,an hour after I had seen you.”,2670
10896,"He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her",2671
10897,disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to,2671
10898,"the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of",2671
10899,following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed,2671
10900,"before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there",2671
10901,had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must,2671
10902,comprehend.,2671
10903,"She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to",2672
10904,each to be dwelt on farther.,2672
10905,"After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know",2673
10906,"anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that",2673
10907,it was time to be at home.,2673
10908,“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which,2674
10909,introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with,2674
10910,their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of,2674
10911,it.,2674
10912,“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.,2675
10913,"“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”",2676
10914,"“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And",2677
10915,"though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much",2677
10916,the case.,2677
10917,"“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a",2678
10918,"confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told",2678
10919,him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his,2678
10920,affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had,2678
10921,"the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself",2678
10922,"mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent",2678
10923,to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was,2678
10924,"unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”",2678
10925,Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his,2679
10926,friend.,2679
10927,"“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him",2680
10928,"that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”",2680
10929,"“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits",2681
10930,which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”,2681
10931,"“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to",2682
10932,him.”,2682
10933,“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had,2683
10934,"prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but",2683
10935,his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one,2683
10936,"thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not",2683
10937,allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months,2683
10938,"last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was",2683
10939,"angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained",2683
10940,in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me,2683
10941,now.”,2683
10942,Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful,2684
10943,friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked,2684
10944,"herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and",2684
10945,it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of,2684
10946,"Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he",2684
10947,continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they,2684

10954,"“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question",2697
10955,"which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and",2697
10956,from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in,2697
10957,"reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own",2697
10958,"knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything",2697
10959,"else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.",2697
10960,"The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The",2698
10961,acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.,2698
10962,Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;,2698
10963,"and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy",2698
10964,"than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,",2698
10965,there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in,2698
10966,the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one,2698
10967,liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a,2698
10968,_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.,2698
10969,At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far,2699
10970,"from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.",2699
10971,"“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,",2700
10972,you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”,2700
10973,"“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;",2701
10974,"and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I",2701
10975,"am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we",2701
10976,are engaged.”,2701
10977,"Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much",2702
10978,you dislike him.”,2702
10979,“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I,2703
10980,did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these,2703
10981,a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever,2703
10982,remember it myself.”,2703
10983,"Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more",2704
10984,"seriously, assured her of its truth.",2704
10985,"“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried",2705
10986,"Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you",2705
10987,certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be,2705
10988,happy with him?”,2705
10989,“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we,2706
10990,"are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?",2706
10991,Shall you like to have such a brother?”,2706
10992,"“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more",2707
10993,"delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you",2707
10994,"really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than",2707
10995,marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought,2707
10996,to do?”,2707
10997,"“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I",2708
10998,tell you all.”,2708
10999,“What do you mean?”,2709
11000,"“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am",2710
11001,afraid you will be angry.”,2710
11002,"“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.",2711
11003,Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me,2711
11004,how long you have loved him?”,2711
11005,"“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;",2712
11006,but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds,2712
11007,at Pemberley.”,2712
11008,"Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the",2713
11009,desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of,2713
11010,"attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing",2713
11011,further to wish.,2713
11012,"“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I",2714
11013,"always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I",2714
11014,"must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your",2714
11015,"husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,",2714
11016,"Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you",2714
11017,tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know,2714
11018,"of it to another, not to you.”",2714
11019,Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to,2715
11020,mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made,2715
11021,her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer,2715
11022,"conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,",2715
11023,and half the night spent in conversation.,2715
11024,"“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next",2716
11025,"morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with",2716
11026,our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always,2716
11027,"coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or",2716
11028,"other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?",2716
11029,"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s",2716
11030,way.”,2716
11031,Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet,2717
11032,was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an,2717
11033,epithet.,2717
11034,"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and",2718
11035,"shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;",2718
11036,"and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes",2718
11037,hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”,2718
11038,"“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk",2719
11039,"to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has",2719
11040,never seen the view.”,2719
11041,"“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am",2720
11042,"sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”",2720
11043,Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great,2721
11044,"curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently",2721
11045,"consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,",2721
11046,"saying,--",2721
11047,"“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that",2722
11048,disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is,2722
11049,"all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to",2722
11050,him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”,2722
11051,"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be",2723
11052,asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the,2723
11053,application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother,2723
11054,would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur,2723
11055,would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she,2723
11056,"were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it",2723
11057,was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to,2723
11058,her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the,2723
11059,"first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her",2723
11060,disapprobation.,2723
11061,"In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw",2724
11062,"Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was",2724
11063,"extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to",2724
11064,"be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,",2724
11065,"his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be",2724
11066,"filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched",2724
11067,"reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,",2724
11068,"looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes",2724
11069,"he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while",2724
11070,"pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he",2724
11071,wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.,2724
11072,"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.",2725
11073,"“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be",2725
11074,accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”,2725
11075,How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more,2726
11076,"reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from",2726
11077,explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;,2726
11078,"but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,",2726
11079,of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.,2726
11080,"“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be",2727
11081,"sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.",2727
11082,But will they make you happy?”,2727
11083,"“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my",2728
11084,indifference?”,2728
11085,"“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but",2729
11086,this would be nothing if you really liked him.”,2729
11087,"“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.",2730
11088,Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not,2730
11089,know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in,2730
11090,such terms.”,2730
11091,"“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind",2731
11092,"of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he",2731
11093,"condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on",2731
11094,having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your,2731
11095,"disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor",2731
11096,"respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked",2731
11097,up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the,2731
11098,greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape,2731
11099,"discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing",2731
11100,_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are,2731
11101,about.”,2731
11102,"Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;",2732
11103,"and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the",2732
11104,"object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her",2732
11105,"estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that",2732
11106,"his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many",2732
11107,"months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,",2732
11108,"she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the",2732
11109,match.,2732
11110,"“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to",2733
11111,"say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with",2733
11112,"you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”",2733
11113,"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy",2734
11114,had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.,2734
11115,"“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;",2735
11116,"made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him",2735
11117,his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble,2735
11118,"and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have",2735
11119,paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own,2735
11120,"way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about",2735
11121,"his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”",2735
11122,He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading,2736
11123,"Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her",2736
11124,"at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come",2736
11125,"for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”",2736
11126,"Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after",2737
11127,"half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join",2737
11128,the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for,2737
11129,"gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer",2737
11130,"anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity",2737
11131,would come in time.,2737
11132,"When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,",2738
11133,and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;,2738
11134,"for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to",2738
11135,"utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could",2738
11136,"comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what",2738
11137,"was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a",2738
11138,"lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in",2738
11139,"her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.",2738
11140,“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would,2739
11141,"have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich",2739
11142,"and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages",2739
11143,you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so,2739
11144,"pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my",2739
11145,dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I,2739
11146,"hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything",2739
11147,"that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,",2739
11148,Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”,2739
11149,This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and,2740
11150,"Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,",2740
11151,"soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,",2740
11152,her mother followed her.,2740
11153,"“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten",2741
11154,"thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a lord! And a",2741
11155,special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.,2741
11156,"But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond",2741
11157,"of, that I may have it to-morrow.”",2741
11158,This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman,2742
11159,"himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain",2742
11160,"possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’",2742
11161,"consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow",2742
11162,passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood,2742
11163,"in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak",2742
11164,"to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark",2742
11165,her deference for his opinion.,2742
11166,Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get,2743
11167,acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising,2743
11168,every hour in his esteem.,2743
11169,"“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,",2744
11170,is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well,2744

11178,Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could,2757
11179,"you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when",2757
11180,you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first,2757
11181,place?”,2757
11182,"“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which",2758
11183,laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I,2758
11184,knew that I _had_ begun.”,2758
11185,"“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour",2759
11186,"to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke",2759
11187,"to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be",2759
11188,sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”,2759
11189,“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”,2760
11190,“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.,2761
11191,"The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious",2761
11192,"attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,",2761
11193,"and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and",2761
11194,"interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really",2761
11195,amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you,2761
11196,"took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and",2761
11197,in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously,2761
11198,courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;,2761
11199,"and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly",2761
11200,reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks,2761
11201,of _that_ when they fall in love.”,2761
11202,"“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was",2762
11203,ill at Netherfield?”,2762
11204,“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it,2763
11205,"by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are",2763
11206,"to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me",2763
11207,to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may,2763
11208,"be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling",2763
11209,"to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you",2763
11210,"first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you",2763
11211,"called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”",2763
11212,"“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”",2764
11213,“But I was embarrassed.”,2765
11214,“And so was I.”,2766
11215,“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”,2767
11216,“A man who had felt less might.”,2768
11217,"“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that",2769
11218,I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you,2769
11219,"_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when",2769
11220,you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of,2769
11221,thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too,2769
11222,"much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort",2769
11223,"springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the",2769
11224,subject? This will never do.”,2769
11225,“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady,2770
11226,Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of,2770
11227,removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to,2770
11228,your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to,2770
11229,"wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,",2770
11230,and I was determined at once to know everything.”,2770
11231,"“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,",2771
11232,"for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to",2771
11233,Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?,2771
11234,or had you intended any more serious consequences?”,2771
11235,"“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I",2772
11236,"might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to",2772
11237,"myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and",2772
11238,"if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”",2772
11239,“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to,2773
11240,befall her?”,2773
11241,"“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to",2774
11242,be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done,2774
11243,directly.”,2774
11244,"“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and",2775
11245,"admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But",2775
11246,"I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”",2775
11247,From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy,2776
11248,"had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s",2776
11249,"long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would",2776
11250,"be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt",2776
11251,"had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as",2776
11252,follows:--,2776
11253,"“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,",2777
11254,"for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the",2777
11255,"truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.",2777
11256,"But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,",2777
11257,indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will,2777
11258,"afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly",2777
11259,"err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more",2777
11260,"than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to",2777
11261,the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the,2777
11262,ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the,2777
11263,happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so,2777
11264,"before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she",2777
11265,"only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that",2777
11266,can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.,2777
11267,"Yours,” etc.",2777
11268,"Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still",2778
11269,"different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return",2778
11270,for his last.,2778
11271,"     /* “Dear Sir, */",2779
11272,     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will,2780
11273,     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as,2780
11274,"     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has",2780
11275,     more to give.,2780
11276,"“Yours sincerely,” etc.",2781
11277,Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching,2782
11278,marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to,2782
11279,"Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former",2782
11280,"professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and",2782
11281,"though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much",2782
11282,kinder answer than she knew was deserved.,2782
11283,The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was,2783
11284,as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were,2783
11285,"insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of",2783
11286,being loved by her sister.,2783
11287,"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations",2784
11288,"to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the",2784
11289,Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this,2784
11290,sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so,2784
11291,"exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that",2784
11292,"Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till",2784
11293,"the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend",2784
11294,"was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their",2784
11295,"meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she",2784
11296,saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her,2784
11297,"husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even",2784
11298,"listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away",2784
11299,"the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all",2784
11300,"meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did",2784
11301,"shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.",2784
11302,"Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his",2785
11303,"forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in",2785
11304,too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s,2785
11305,"good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be",2785
11306,"vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at",2785
11307,all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to,2785
11308,"shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to",2785
11309,"keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might",2785
11310,converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings,2785
11311,arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its,2785
11312,"pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward",2785
11313,with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so,2785
11314,"little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their",2785
11315,family party at Pemberley.,2785
11316,[Illustration],2789
11317,CHAPTER LXI.,2793
11318,[Illustration],2795
11319,Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got,2796
11320,rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she,2796
11321,"afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be",2796
11322,"guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the",2796
11323,accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of,2796
11324,"her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,",2796
11325,"amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,",2796
11326,"it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic",2796
11327,"felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous",2796
11328,and invariably silly.,2796
11329,Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her,2797
11330,drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in,2797
11331,"going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.",2797
11332,Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near,2798
11333,a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to,2798
11334,"_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his",2798
11335,sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county,2798
11336,"to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source",2798
11337,"of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.",2798
11338,"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with",2799
11339,her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally,2799
11340,"known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a",2799
11341,"temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she",2799
11342,"became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less",2799
11343,"ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s",2799
11344,society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham,2799
11345,"frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of",2799
11346,"balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.",2799
11347,Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily,2800
11348,drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite,2800
11349,"unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but",2800
11350,she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no,2800
11351,"longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,",2800
11352,it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without,2800
11353,much reluctance.,2800
11354,"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from",2801
11355,the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that,2801
11356,Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude,2801
11357,"and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of",2801
11358,"everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be",2801
11359,prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which,2801
11360,"Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by",2801
11361,"his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The",2801
11362,letter was to this effect:--,2801
11363,"     /* “My dear Lizzy, */",2802
11364,     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear,2803
11365,"     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you",2803
11366,"     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will",2803
11367,     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very,2803
11368,     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live,2803
11369,     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four,2803
11370,"     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,",2803
11371,     if you had rather not.,2803
11372,"“Yours,” etc.",2804
11373,"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in",2805
11374,her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.,2805
11375,"Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice",2805
11376,"of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she",2805
11377,frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an,2805
11378,"income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in",2805
11379,"their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to",2805
11380,"their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or",2805
11381,herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards,2805
11382,"discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the",2805
11383,"restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the",2805
11384,extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a,2805
11385,"cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection",2805
11386,"for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,",2805
11387,"in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to",2805
11388,reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never,2805
11389,"receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him",2805
11390,"further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when",2805
11391,her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the,2805
11392,"Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even",2805
11393,"Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_",2805
11394,of giving them a hint to be gone.,2805
11395,Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she,2806
11396,"thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she",2806
11397,"dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as",2806
11398,"attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility",2806
11399,to Elizabeth.,2806
11400,Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters,2807
11401,was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each,2807
11402,"other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion",2807
11403,in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an,2807
11404,"astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of",2807
11405,"talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect",2807
11406,"which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open",2807
11407,pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in,2807
11408,her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a,2807
11409,"woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not",2807
11410,always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.,2807
11411,Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;,2808
11412,"and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in",2808
11413,"her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him",2808
11414,"language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time",2808
11415,"all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,",2808
11416,"he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;",2808
11417,"and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her",2808
11418,"resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity",2808
11419,to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on,2808
11420,"them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had",2808
11421,"received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the",2808
11422,visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.,2808
11423,"With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,",2809
11424,"as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever",2809
11425,"sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing",2809
11426,"her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.",2809
