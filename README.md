# STATS507-final-project

We propose a novel implementation of the transformer-based text classification model, "Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base" from HuggingFace. The texts of eight English novels are split into sentences, which are assigned one of seven emotion classes by the model. These methods support an in-depth emotional analysis of historical works of English literature.
