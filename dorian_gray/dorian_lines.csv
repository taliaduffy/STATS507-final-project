0,THE PREFACE,0
1,The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and,2
2,conceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate,2
3,into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful,2
4,things.,2
5,The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.,3
6,Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without,3
7,being charming. This is a fault.,3
8,Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the,4
9,cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom,4
10,beautiful things mean only beauty.,4
11,There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well,5
12,"written, or badly written. That is all.",5
13,The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing,6
14,his own face in a glass.,6
15,The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban,7
16,not seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of,7
17,"the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in",7
18,the perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove,7
19,anything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has,7
20,ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable,7
21,mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express,7
22,everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an,7
23,art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the,7
24,"point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the",7
25,"musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the",7
26,type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the,7
27,surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their,7
28,"peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.",7
29,"Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,",7
30,"complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with",7
31,himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he,7
32,does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that,7
33,one admires it intensely.,7
34,All art is quite useless.,8

36,CHAPTER I.,13
37,"The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light",15
38,"summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through",15
39,"the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate",15
40,perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.,15
41,From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was,16
42,"lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry",16
43,Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured,16
44,"blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to",16
45,bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then,16
46,the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long,16
47,"tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,",16
48,"producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of",16
49,"those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of",16
50,"an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of",16
51,swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their,16
52,"way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous",16
53,"insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,",16
54,seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London,16
55,was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.,16
56,"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the",17
57,"full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,",17
58,"and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist",17
59,"himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago",17
60,"caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many",17
61,strange conjectures.,17
62,As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so,18
63,"skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his",18
64,"face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and",18
65,"closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought",18
66,to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he,18
67,might awake.,18
68,"“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said",19
69,Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the,19
70,Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have,19
71,"gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been",19
72,"able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that",19
73,"I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor",19
74,is really the only place.”,19
75,"“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head",20
76,back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at,20
77,"Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”",20
78,Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through,21
79,the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls,21
80,"from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear",21
81,"fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You",21
82,"do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,",21
83,"you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is",21
84,"only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is",21
85,not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above,21
86,"all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if",21
87,old men are ever capable of any emotion.”,21
88,"“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit",22
89,it. I have put too much of myself into it.”,22
90,Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.,23
91,"“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”",24
92,"“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you",25
93,"were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with",25
94,"your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young",25
95,"Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,",25
96,"my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an",25
97,"intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends",25
98,where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode,25
99,"of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one",25
100,"sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something",25
101,horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.,25
102,"How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But",25
103,then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the,25
104,"age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,",25
105,and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.,25
106,"Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but",25
107,"whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of",25
108,that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here,25
109,"in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer",25
110,when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter,25
111,"yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”",25
112,"“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am",26
113,"not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to",26
114,look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.,26
115,"There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,",26
116,the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering,26
117,steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.,26
118,The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit,26
119,"at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,",26
120,they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all,26
121,"should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They",26
122,"neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.",26
123,"Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,",26
124,whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer,26
125,"for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”",26
126,"“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the",27
127,studio towards Basil Hallward.,27
128,"“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”",28
129,“But why not?”,29
130,"“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their",30
131,names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown,30
132,to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life,30
133,mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if,30
134,one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I,30
135,"am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,",30
136,"I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into",30
137,one’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”,30
138,"“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem",31
139,"to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it",31
140,makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I,31
141,"never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.",31
142,"When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go",31
143,down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the,31
144,"most serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,",31
145,"than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But",31
146,"when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish",31
147,she would; but she merely laughs at me.”,31
148,"“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil",32
149,"Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I",32
150,"believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are",32
151,thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary,32
152,"fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.",32
153,Your cynicism is simply a pose.”,32
154,"“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”",33
155,"cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the",33
156,garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that,33
157,stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the,33
158,"polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.",33
159,"After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be",34
160,"going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your",34
161,answering a question I put to you some time ago.”,34
162,"“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.",35
163,“You know quite well.”,36
164,"“I do not, Harry.”",37
165,"“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you",38
166,won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”,38
167,“I told you the real reason.”,39
168,"“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of",40
169,"yourself in it. Now, that is childish.”",40
170,"“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every",41
171,"portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not",41
172,"of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is",41
173,"not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on",41
174,"the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit",41
175,this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of,41
176,my own soul.”,41
177,Lord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.,42
178,"“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came",43
179,over his face.,43
180,"“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at",44
181,him.,44
182,"“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;",45
183,“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly,45
184,believe it.”,45
185,"Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from",46
186,"the grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he",46
187,"replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,",46
188,"“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it",46
189,is quite incredible.”,46
190,"The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy",47
191,"lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the",47
192,"languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a",47
193,blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze,47
194,wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart,47
195,"beating, and wondered what was coming.",47
196,"“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two",48
197,months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor,48
198,"artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to",48
199,remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a,48
200,"white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain",48
201,"a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room",48
202,"about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious",48
203,"academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at",48
204,me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.,48
205,"When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation",48
206,of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some,48
207,"one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to",48
208,"do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art",48
209,itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know,48
210,"yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my",48
211,"own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.",48
212,Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to,48
213,tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had,48
214,a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and,48
215,exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was,48
216,not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take,48
217,no credit to myself for trying to escape.”,48
218,"“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience",49
219,is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”,49
220,"“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.",50
221,"However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used",50
222,"to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I",50
223,"stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,",50
224,Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”,50
225,"“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,",51
226,pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.,51
227,"“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people",52
228,"with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and",52
229,parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her,52
230,"once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe",52
231,"some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had",52
232,"been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the",52
233,nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself,52
234,face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely,52
235,"stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.",52
236,"It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.",52
237,"Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We",52
238,would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of,52
239,"that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined",52
240,to know each other.”,52
241,“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his,53
242,companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her,53
243,guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old,53
244,"gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my",53
245,"ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to",53
246,"everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I",53
247,like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests,53
248,exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them,53
249,"entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants",53
250,to know.”,53
251,"“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward",54
252,listlessly.,54
253,"“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in",55
254,"opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she",55
255,say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”,55
256,"“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely",56
257,inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do,56
258,"anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’",56
259,"Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”",56
260,"“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far",57
261,"the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.",57
262,"Hallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,",58
263,"Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every",58
264,"one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”",58
265,"“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back",59
266,"and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of",59
267,"glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the",59
268,summer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference,59
269,"between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my",59
270,"acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good",59
271,intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I,59
272,have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual,59
273,"power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of",59
274,me? I think it is rather vain.”,59
275,"“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be",60
276,merely an acquaintance.”,60
277,"“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”",61
278,"“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”",62
279,"“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,",63
280,and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”,63
281,"“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.",64
282,"“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my",65
283,relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand,65
284,other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize,65
285,with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices,65
286,"of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and",65
287,"immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of",65
288,"us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When",65
289,"poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite",65
290,magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the,65
291,proletariat live correctly.”,65
292,"“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is",66
293,"more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”",66
294,Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his,67
295,patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are,67
296,Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one,67
297,puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he,67
298,never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The,67
299,only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it,67
300,"oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with",67
301,"the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities",67
302,"are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual",67
303,"will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his",67
304,"wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to",67
305,"discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons",67
306,"better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better",67
307,than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.,67
308,How often do you see him?”,67
309,“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is,68
310,absolutely necessary to me.”,68
311,“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but,69
312,your art.”,69
313,"“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes",70
314,"think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the",70
315,"world’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,",70
316,and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.,70
317,"What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of",70
318,"Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will",70
319,"some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from",70
320,"him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much",70
321,more to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am,70
322,"dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such",70
323,"that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,",70
324,"and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good",70
325,"work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder",70
326,will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely,70
327,"new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things",70
328,"differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a",70
329,way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of,70
330,thought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray,70
331,has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to,70
332,"me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely",70
333,visible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?,70
334,"Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school",70
335,"that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the",70
336,perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and,70
337,"body—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and",70
338,"have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.",70
339,Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that,70
340,"landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but",70
341,which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever,70
342,"done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray",70
343,"sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the",70
344,first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had,70
345,always looked for and always missed.”,70
346,"“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”",71
347,Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After,72
348,"some time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply",72
349,a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.,72
350,He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.,72
351,"He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the",72
352,"curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain",72
353,colours. That is all.”,72
354,“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.,73
355,"“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of",74
356,"all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never",74
357,cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know,74
358,"anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my",74
359,soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under,74
360,"their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too",74
361,much of myself!”,74
362,“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion,75
363,is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”,75
364,"“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create",76
365,"beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We",76
366,live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of,76
367,autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I,76
368,will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall,76
369,never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”,76
370,"“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only",77
371,"the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very",77
372,fond of you?”,77
373,"The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered",78
374,after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.,78
375,I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall,78
376,"be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit",78
377,"in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he",78
378,"is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me",78
379,"pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some",78
380,"one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of",78
381,"decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”",78
382,"“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.",79
383,“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think,79
384,"of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That",79
385,accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate,79
386,"ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have",79
387,"something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and",79
388,"facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly",79
389,well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the,79
390,thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a,79
391,"_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above",79
392,"its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day",79
393,"you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little",79
394,"out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You",79
395,"will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that",79
396,"he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be",79
397,"perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will",79
398,"alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art",79
399,"one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is",79
400,that it leaves one so unromantic.”,79
401,"“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of",80
402,Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change,80
403,too often.”,80
404,"“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are",81
405,faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who,81
406,know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty,81
407,silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and,81
408,"satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was",81
409,"a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,",81
410,and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like,81
411,swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other,81
412,"people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it",81
413,"seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those",81
414,were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent,81
415,amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long,81
416,"with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure",81
417,"to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have",81
418,been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model,81
419,lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those,81
420,"virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.",81
421,"The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown",81
422,eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped,81
423,"all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He",81
424,"turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”",81
425,"“Remembered what, Harry?”",82
426,“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”,83
427,"“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.",84
428,"“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told",85
429,me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her,85
430,"in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state",85
431,that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation,85
432,"of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very",85
433,earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a,85
434,"creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping",85
435,about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”,85
436,"“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”",86
437,“Why?”,87
438,“I don’t want you to meet him.”,88
439,“You don’t want me to meet him?”,89
440,“No.”,90
441,"“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into",91
442,the garden.,91
443,"“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",92
444,"The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.",93
445,"“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man",93
446,bowed and went up the walk.,93
447,"Then he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he",94
448,said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite,94
449,right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence,94
450,"him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many",94
451,marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who,94
452,gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist,94
453,"depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and",94
454,the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.,94
455,"“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward",95
456,"by the arm, he almost led him into the house.",95
457,CHAPTER II.,99
458,"As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with",101
459,"his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s",101
460,"“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to",101
461,learn them. They are perfectly charming.”,101
462,"“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”",102
463,"“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of",103
464,"myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a",103
465,"wilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint",103
466,"blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your",103
467,"pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”",103
468,"“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I",104
469,"have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you",104
470,have spoiled everything.”,104
471,"“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord",105
472,"Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often",105
473,"spoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am",105
474,"afraid, one of her victims also.”",105
475,"“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a",106
476,funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel,106
477,"with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to",106
478,"have played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what",106
479,she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”,106
480,"“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.",107
481,And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The,107
482,audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to,107
483,"the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”",107
484,"“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,",108
485,laughing.,108
486,"Lord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,",109
487,"with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp",109
488,gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at,109
489,"once. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s",109
490,passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the,109
491,world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.,109
492,"“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too",110
493,charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened,110
494,his cigarette-case.,110
495,The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes,111
496,"ready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last",111
497,"remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,",111
498,"“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it",111
499,awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”,111
500,"Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he",112
501,asked.,112
502,"“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky",113
503,"moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell",113
504,me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”,113
505,"“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a",114
506,subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly,114
507,"shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t",114
508,"really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your",114
509,sitters to have some one to chat to.”,114
510,"Hallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.",115
511,"Dorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”",115
512,"Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,",116
513,but I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the,116
514,"Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon",116
515,Street. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when,116
516,you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”,116
517,"“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,",117
518,"too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is",117
519,horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask,117
520,him to stay. I insist upon it.”,117
521,"“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,",118
522,"gazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I",118
523,"am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious",118
524,for my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”,118
525,“But what about my man at the Orleans?”,119
526,The painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about,120
527,"that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,",120
528,"and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry",120
529,"says. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single",120
530,exception of myself.”,120
531,Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek,121
532,"martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom",121
533,he had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a,121
534,delightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few,121
535,"moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord",121
536,Henry? As bad as Basil says?”,121
537,"“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is",122
538,immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”,122
539,“Why?”,123
540,“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does,124
541,"not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His",124
542,"virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as",124
543,"sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an",124
544,actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is,124
545,self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each,124
546,"of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have",124
547,"forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s",124
548,"self. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe",124
549,"the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone",124
550,"out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,",124
551,"which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of",124
552,religion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”,124
553,"“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good",125
554,"boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look",125
555,had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.,125
556,"“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with",126
557,that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of,126
558,"him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man",126
559,"were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to",126
560,"every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I",126
561,believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we,126
562,"would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the",126
563,"Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it",126
564,may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The,126
565,mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial,126
566,that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse,126
567,that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body,126
568,"sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of",126
569,"purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,",126
570,or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is,126
571,"to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for",126
572,"the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its",126
573,monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that,126
574,the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the,126
575,"brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place",126
576,"also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your",126
577,"rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,",126
578,"thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping",126
579,dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”,126
580,"“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what",127
581,"to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.",127
582,"Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”",127
583,"For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and",128
584,eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh,128
585,influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come,128
586,really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to,128
587,"him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in",128
588,"them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,",128
589,but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.,128
590,Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But,129
591,"music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another",129
592,"chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they",129
593,"were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.",129
594,And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able,129
595,"to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their",129
596,own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything,129
597,so real as words?,129
598,Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.,130
599,He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It,130
600,seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known,130
601,it?,130
602,"With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise",131
603,psychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.,131
604,"He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,",131
605,"and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book",131
606,"which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he",131
607,wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.,131
608,He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How,131
609,fascinating the lad was!,131
610,"Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had",132
611,"the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes",132
612,only from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.,132
613,"“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go",133
614,out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”,133
615,"“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of",134
616,anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And,134
617,I have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright,134
618,"look in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but",134
619,he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose,134
620,he has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he,134
621,says.”,134
622,“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the,135
623,reason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”,135
624,"“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his",136
625,dreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is,136
626,"horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,",136
627,something with strawberries in it.”,136
628,"“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will",137
629,"tell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I",137
630,will join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been,137
631,in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my,137
632,masterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”,137
633,Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his,138
634,"face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their",138
635,perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand,138
636,"upon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.",138
637,"“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the",138
638,senses but the soul.”,138
639,"The lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had",139
640,tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There,139
641,"was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are",139
642,"suddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some",139
643,hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.,139
644,"“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of",140
645,"life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means",140
646,of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think,140
647,"you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”",140
648,Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking,141
649,"the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,",141
650,olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was,141
651,something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His,141
652,"cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,",141
653,"as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.",141
654,"But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been",141
655,left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil,141
656,"Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered",141
657,him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to,141
658,"have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be",141
659,afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be,141
660,frightened.,141
661,"“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought",142
662,"out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be",142
663,"quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must",142
664,not allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”,142
665,"“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on",143
666,the seat at the end of the garden.,143
667,"“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”",144
668,“Why?”,145
669,"“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing",146
670,worth having.”,146
671,"“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”",147
672,"“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and",148
673,"ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion",148
674,"branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will",148
675,"feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it",148
676,"always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.",148
677,"Don’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,",148
678,"indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great",148
679,"facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in",148
680,dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be,148
681,questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of,148
682,those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t,148
683,smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That,148
684,"may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,",148
685,beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not,148
686,"judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not",148
687,"the invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But",148
688,what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in,148
689,"which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your",148
690,"beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there",148
691,"are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those",148
692,mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than,148
693,defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something,148
694,"dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your",148
695,"roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You",148
696,will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.,148
697,"Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying",148
698,"to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the",148
699,"ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the",148
700,"false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!",148
701,Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.,148
702,Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.,148
703,You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing,148
704,you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment,148
705,"I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,",148
706,of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me,148
707,that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how,148
708,tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time,148
709,that your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers,148
710,"wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next",148
711,June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the,148
712,"clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold",148
713,its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy,148
714,"that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses",148
715,"rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the",148
716,"passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite",148
717,temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!,148
718,There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”,148
719,"Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell",149
720,from his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for,149
721,a moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe,149
722,of the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in,149
723,trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make,149
724,"us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we",149
725,"cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays",149
726,sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the,149
727,bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian,149
728,"convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and",149
729,fro.,149
730,Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made,150
731,staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and,150
732,smiled.,150
733,"“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and",151
734,you can bring your drinks.”,151
735,They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white,152
736,"butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of",152
737,the garden a thrush began to sing.,152
738,"“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at",153
739,him.,153
740,"“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”",154
741,“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.,155
742,Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to,155
743,"make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only",155
744,difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice,155
745,lasts a little longer.”,155
746,"As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s",156
747,"arm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,",156
748,"flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and",156
749,resumed his pose.,156
750,Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.,157
751,The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that,157
752,"broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back",157
753,to look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that,157
754,streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The,157
755,heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.,157
756,"After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for",158
757,"a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,",158
758,biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite,158
759,"finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in",158
760,long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.,158
761,Lord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a,159
762,"wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.",159
763,"“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said. “It is the",160
764,"finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at",160
765,yourself.”,160
766,"The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.",161
767,"“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.",162
768,"“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat splendidly",163
769,to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”,163
770,"“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry. “Isn’t it, Mr.",164
771,Gray?”,164
772,"Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture",165
773,"and turned towards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks",165
774,"flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes,",165
775,as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He stood there,165
776,"motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to",165
777,"him, but not catching the meaning of his words. The sense of his own",165
778,beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before.,165
779,Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the,165
780,"charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed",165
781,"at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had",165
782,"come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his",165
783,"terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and",165
784,"now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full",165
785,"reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a",165
786,"day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and",165
787,"colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet",165
788,would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair. The,165
789,life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become,165
790,"dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.",165
791,"As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a",166
792,knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes,166
793,"deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He felt",166
794,as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.,166
795,"“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the",167
796,"lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.",167
797,"“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t like it? It is",168
798,one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you anything you,168
799,like to ask for it. I must have it.”,168
800,"“It is not my property, Harry.”",169
801,“Whose property is it?”,170
802,"“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.",171
803,“He is a very lucky fellow.”,172
804,“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon,173
805,"his own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and",173
806,dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be,173
807,older than this particular day of June.... If it were only the other,173
808,"way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was",173
809,"to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is",173
810,nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for,173
811,that!”,173
812,"“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord",174
813,"Henry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”",174
814,"“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.",175
815,"Dorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You",176
816,like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a,176
817,"green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”",176
818,The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like,177
819,that. What had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed,177
820,and his cheeks burning.,177
821,"“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your",178
822,silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till,178
823,"I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses",178
824,"one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your",178
825,picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth,178
826,"is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I",178
827,shall kill myself.”,178
828,"Hallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he cried,",179
829,"“don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I",179
830,"shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material things,",179
831,are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”,179
832,“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of,180
833,the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must,180
834,lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives,180
835,"something to it. Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture",180
836,"could change, and I could be always what I am now! Why did you paint",180
837,it? It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled,180
838,"into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the",180
839,"divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.",180
840,"“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.",181
841,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that is,182
842,all.”,182
843,“It is not.”,183
844,"“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”",184
845,"“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.",185
846,"“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.",186
847,"“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between",187
848,you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever,187
849,"done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will",187
850,not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”,187
851,"Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid",188
852,"face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal",188
853,painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window. What was,188
854,he doing there? His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin,188
855,"tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something. Yes, it was for the long",188
856,"palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He had found it at",188
857,last. He was going to rip up the canvas.,188
858,"With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to",189
859,"Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of",189
860,"the studio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It would be murder!”",189
861,"“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter",190
862,coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought you,190
863,would.”,190
864,"“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I",191
865,feel that.”,191
866,"“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and",192
867,sent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked,192
868,"across the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of",192
869,"course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple",192
870,pleasures?”,192
871,"“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the last refuge",193
872,"of the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage. What",193
873,"absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as",193
874,a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man,193
875,"is many things, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after",193
876,all—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You,193
877,"had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really",193
878,"want it, and I really do.”",193
879,"“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!”",194
880,cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”,194
881,"“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it",195
882,existed.”,195
883,"“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you",196
884,don’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”,196
885,"“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”",197
886,“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”,198
887,"There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden",199
888,tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a,199
889,rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.,199
890,Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray,199
891,went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to,199
892,the table and examined what was under the covers.,199
893,"“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There is sure to",200
894,"be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at White’s, but it",200
895,"is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am",200
896,"ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent",200
897,engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have,200
898,all the surprise of candour.”,200
899,"“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.",201
900,"“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”",201
901,"“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth",202
902,"century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the only",202
903,real colour-element left in modern life.”,202
904,"“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”",203
905,"“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one",204
906,in the picture?”,204
907,“Before either.”,205
908,"“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the",206
909,lad.,206
910,"“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”",207
911,"“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do.”",208
912,"“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”",209
913,“I should like that awfully.”,210
914,"The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.",211
915,"“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.",211
916,"“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling",212
917,across to him. “Am I really like that?”,212
918,“Yes; you are just like that.”,213
919,"“How wonderful, Basil!”",214
920,"“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”",215
921,sighed Hallward. “That is something.”,215
922,"“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “Why,",216
923,even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to,216
924,"do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old",216
925,"men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”",216
926,"“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward. “Stop and",217
927,dine with me.”,217
928,"“I can’t, Basil.”",218
929,“Why?”,219
930,“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”,220
931,“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always,221
932,breaks his own. I beg you not to go.”,221
933,Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.,222
934,“I entreat you.”,223
935,"The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them",224
936,from the tea-table with an amused smile.,224
937,"“I must go, Basil,” he answered.",225
938,"“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on",226
939,"the tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better",226
940,"lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.",226
941,Come to-morrow.”,226
942,“Certainly.”,227
943,“You won’t forget?”,228
944,"“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.",229
945,“And ... Harry!”,230
946,"“Yes, Basil?”",231
947,"“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”",232
948,“I have forgotten it.”,233
949,“I trust you.”,234
950,"“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing. “Come, Mr.",235
951,"Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.",235
952,"Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”",235
953,"As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a",236
954,"sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.",236
955,CHAPTER III.,240
956,At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon,242
957,"Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial",242
958,"if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called",242
959,"selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was",242
960,considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him. His,242
961,father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and,242
962,"Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a",242
963,capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at,242
964,"Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by",242
965,"reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches,",242
966,"and his inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his",242
967,"father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat",242
968,"foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months",242
969,"later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great",242
970,aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing. He had two large town,242
971,"houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and",242
972,took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the,242
973,"management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself",242
974,for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of,242
975,having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of,242
976,"burning wood on his own hearth. In politics he was a Tory, except when",242
977,"the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them",242
978,"for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to his valet, who bullied",242
979,"him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.",242
980,"Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the",242
981,"country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but",242
982,there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.,242
983,"When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough",243
984,"shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_. “Well,",243
985,"Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early? I",243
986,"thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till",243
987,five.”,243
988,"“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get",244
989,something out of you.”,244
990,"“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. “Well, sit",245
991,"down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine that",245
992,money is everything.”,245
993,"“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and",246
994,when they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It is only,246
995,"people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay",246
996,"mine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly",246
997,"upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and",246
998,consequently they never bother me. What I want is information: not,246
999,"useful information, of course; useless information.”",246
1000,"“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,",247
1001,although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in,247
1002,"the Diplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in",247
1003,"now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure",247
1004,"humbug from beginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite",247
1005,"enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for",247
1006,him.”,247
1007,"“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said",248
1008,Lord Henry languidly.,248
1009,"“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy",249
1010,white eyebrows.,249
1011,"“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who",250
1012,"he is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,",250
1013,Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What,250
1014,was she like? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in,250
1015,"your time, so you might have known her. I am very much interested in",250
1016,Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him.”,250
1017,“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman. “Kelso’s grandson! ... Of,251
1018,course.... I knew his mother intimately. I believe I was at her,251
1019,"christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret",251
1020,"Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless",251
1021,"young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or",251
1022,something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it,251
1023,happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few,251
1024,months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said,251
1025,"Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his",251
1026,"son-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the",251
1027,fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed,251
1028,"up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time",251
1029,"afterwards. He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she",251
1030,"never spoke to him again. Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl",251
1031,"died, too, died within a year. So she left a son, did she? I had",251
1032,"forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his mother, he",251
1033,must be a good-looking chap.”,251
1034,"“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.",252
1035,"“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man. “He",253
1036,should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing,253
1037,"by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,",253
1038,"through her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a",253
1039,"mean dog. He was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I",253
1040,was ashamed of him. The Queen used to ask me about the English noble,253
1041,who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares. They made,253
1042,quite a story of it. I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I,253
1043,hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.”,253
1044,"“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the boy will be well",254
1045,"off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me so. And ...",254
1046,his mother was very beautiful?”,254
1047,"“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw,",255
1048,"Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could",255
1049,understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was,255
1050,"mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family",255
1051,"were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful.",255
1052,Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at,255
1053,"him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after",255
1054,"him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this",255
1055,humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an,255
1056,American? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”,255
1057,"“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”",256
1058,"“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor,",257
1059,striking the table with his fist.,257
1060,“The betting is on the Americans.”,258
1061,"“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.",259
1062,"“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a",260
1063,steeplechase. They take things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a,260
1064,chance.”,260
1065,“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she got any?”,261
1066,Lord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing,262
1067,"their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said,",262
1068,rising to go.,262
1069,"“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”",263
1070,"“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that",264
1071,"pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after",264
1072,politics.”,264
1073,“Is she pretty?”,265
1074,“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the,266
1075,secret of their charm.”,266
1076,“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are,267
1077,always telling us that it is the paradise for women.”,267
1078,"“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively",268
1079,"anxious to get out of it,” said Lord Henry. “Good-bye, Uncle George. I",268
1080,"shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the",268
1081,information I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new,268
1082,"friends, and nothing about my old ones.”",268
1083,"“Where are you lunching, Harry?”",269
1084,“At Aunt Agatha’s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest,270
1085,_protégé_.”,270
1086,"“Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with",271
1087,"her charity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that",271
1088,I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”,271
1089,"“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have any effect.",272
1090,Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their,272
1091,distinguishing characteristic.”,272
1092,The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his,273
1093,servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and,273
1094,turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.,273
1095,So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had,274
1096,"been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a",274
1097,"strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything",274
1098,for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a,274
1099,"hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child",274
1100,"born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to",274
1101,solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an,274
1102,"interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it",274
1103,"were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something",274
1104,"tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might",274
1105,"blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as",274
1106,with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat,274
1107,"opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer",274
1108,rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing,274
1109,upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the,274
1110,bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of,274
1111,influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into,274
1112,"some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s",274
1113,own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of,274
1114,passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though,274
1115,it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in,274
1116,that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited,274
1117,"and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and",274
1118,"grossly common in its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad,",274
1119,"whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be",274
1120,"fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the",274
1121,"white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for",274
1122,us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made,274
1123,a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to,274
1124,"fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how",274
1125,"interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at",274
1126,"life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who",274
1127,was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim,274
1128,"woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself,",274
1129,"Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there",274
1130,had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful,274
1131,"things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it",274
1132,"were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they",274
1133,were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose,274
1134,shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something,274
1135,"like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had",274
1136,first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the,274
1137,coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was,274
1138,"strange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without",274
1139,"knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful",274
1140,"portrait. He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done",274
1141,so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something,274
1142,fascinating in this son of love and death.,274
1143,Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had,275
1144,"passed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.",275
1145,"When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they",275
1146,had gone in to lunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and,275
1147,passed into the dining-room.,275
1148,"“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.",276
1149,"He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to",277
1150,"her, looked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from",277
1151,"the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.",277
1152,"Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and",277
1153,"good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample",277
1154,architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are,277
1155,"described by contemporary historians as stoutness. Next to her sat, on",277
1156,"her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who",277
1157,followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the,277
1158,"best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in",277
1159,accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was,277
1160,"occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable",277
1161,"charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence,",277
1162,"having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he",277
1163,"had to say before he was thirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur,",277
1164,"one of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so",277
1165,dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.,277
1166,"Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most",277
1167,"intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement",277
1168,"in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely",277
1169,"earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once",277
1170,"himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of",277
1171,them ever quite escape.,277
1172,"“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess,",278
1173,nodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he will,278
1174,really marry this fascinating young person?”,278
1175,"“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”",279
1176,"“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one should",280
1177,interfere.”,280
1178,"“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American",281
1179,"dry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.",281
1180,"“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”",282
1181,"“Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess, raising",283
1182,her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.,283
1183,"“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.",284
1184,The duchess looked puzzled.,285
1185,"“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He never means",286
1186,anything that he says.”,286
1187,"“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he began to",287
1188,give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a,287
1189,"subject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised",287
1190,her privilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been,287
1191,"discovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no chance",287
1192,nowadays. It is most unfair.”,287
1193,"“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.",288
1194,Erskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”,288
1195,"“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the",289
1196,duchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely,289
1197,"pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris.",289
1198,I wish I could afford to do the same.”,289
1199,"“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir",290
1200,"Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.",290
1201,“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the,291
1202,duchess.,291
1203,"“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.",292
1204,Sir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against,293
1205,"that great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all over",293
1206,"it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are",293
1207,extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”,293
1208,“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.,294
1209,Erskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”,294
1210,Sir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on,295
1211,"his shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about",295
1212,them. The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are,295
1213,absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing,295
1214,"characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people. I",295
1215,assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”,295
1216,"“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force, but brute",296
1217,reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use. It,296
1218,is hitting below the intellect.”,296
1219,"“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.",297
1220,"“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.",298
1221,“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.,299
1222,“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so. Perhaps,300
1223,"it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality",300
1224,"we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we",300
1225,can judge them.”,300
1226,"“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I never can",301
1227,"make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with",301
1228,you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the,301
1229,East End? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love,301
1230,his playing.”,301
1231,"“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked",302
1232,down the table and caught a bright answering glance.,302
1233,"“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.",303
1234,"“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry,",304
1235,shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too,304
1236,"ugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid",304
1237,in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the,304
1238,"colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life’s sores,",304
1239,the better.”,304
1240,"“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas",305
1241,with a grave shake of the head.,305
1242,"“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of slavery, and",306
1243,we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”,306
1244,"The politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,",307
1245,then?” he asked.,307
1246,Lord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England,308
1247,"except the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with philosophic",308
1248,"contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through",308
1249,"an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal",308
1250,to science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that,308
1251,"they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not",308
1252,emotional.”,308
1253,"“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur",309
1254,timidly.,309
1255,"“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.",310
1256,Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too,311
1257,seriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how,311
1258,"to laugh, history would have been different.”",311
1259,"“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I have always",312
1260,"felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no",312
1261,interest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look,312
1262,her in the face without a blush.”,312
1263,"“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.",313
1264,"“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman like myself",314
1265,"blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell",314
1266,me how to become young again.”,314
1267,He thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you,315
1268,"committed in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across",315
1269,the table.,315
1270,"“A great many, I fear,” she cried.",316
1271,"“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back one’s",317
1272,"youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”",317
1273,“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into practice.”,318
1274,“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady Agatha,319
1275,"shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.",319
1276,"“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.",320
1277,"Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and",320
1278,discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are,320
1279,one’s mistakes.”,320
1280,A laugh ran round the table.,321
1281,He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and,322
1282,transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent,322
1283,"with fancy and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went",322
1284,"on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and",322
1285,"catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her",322
1286,"wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the",322
1287,"hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled",322
1288,before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge,322
1289,"press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round",322
1290,"her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over",322
1291,"the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary",322
1292,"improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him,",322
1293,and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose,322
1294,temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and,322
1295,"to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic,",322
1296,"irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they",322
1297,"followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him,",322
1298,"but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips",322
1299,and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.,322
1300,"At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room",323
1301,in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was,323
1302,waiting. She wrung her hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she,323
1303,"cried. “I must go. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take",323
1304,"him to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be",323
1305,"in the chair. If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t",323
1306,have a scene in this bonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would,323
1307,"ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are",323
1308,quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing. I am sure I don’t know,323
1309,what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some,323
1310,night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?”,323
1311,"“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a",324
1312,bow.,324
1313,"“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you",325
1314,"come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the",325
1315,other ladies.,325
1316,"When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking",326
1317,"a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.",326
1318,"“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”",327
1319,"“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I",328
1320,"should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely",328
1321,as a Persian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in,328
1322,"England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of",328
1323,all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty,328
1324,of literature.”,328
1325,"“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used to have",329
1326,"literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young",329
1327,"friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really",329
1328,meant all that you said to us at lunch?”,329
1329,"“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all very bad?”",330
1330,"“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if",331
1331,"anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being",331
1332,primarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The,331
1333,"generation into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are",331
1334,"tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your",331
1335,philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate,331
1336,enough to possess.”,331
1337,“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It,332
1338,"has a perfect host, and a perfect library.”",332
1339,"“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous",333
1340,bow. “And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at,333
1341,the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.”,333
1342,"“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”",334
1343,"“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English",335
1344,Academy of Letters.”,335
1345,"Lord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried.",336
1346,"As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.",337
1347,"“Let me come with you,” he murmured.",337
1348,"“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,”",338
1349,answered Lord Henry.,338
1350,"“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let",339
1351,me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so,339
1352,wonderfully as you do.”,339
1353,"“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry, smiling.",340
1354,“All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with,340
1355,"me, if you care to.”",340
1356,CHAPTER IV.,344
1357,"One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious",346
1358,"arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It",346
1359,"was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled",346
1360,"wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling",346
1361,"of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk,",346
1362,long-fringed Persian rugs. On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette,346
1363,"by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for",346
1364,Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies,346
1365,that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue china jars and,346
1366,"parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small",346
1367,leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a,346
1368,summer day in London.,346
1369,"Lord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his",347
1370,principle being that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was,347
1371,"looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages",347
1372,of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had,347
1373,found in one of the book-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the,347
1374,Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him. Once or twice he thought of going,347
1375,away.,347
1376,"At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you",348
1377,"are, Harry!” he murmured.",348
1378,"“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.",349
1379,He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I,350
1380,thought—”,350
1381,“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me,351
1382,introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my,351
1383,husband has got seventeen of them.”,351
1384,"“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”",352
1385,"“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the",353
1386,"opera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her",353
1387,"vague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always",353
1388,looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.,353
1389,"She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never",353
1390,"returned, she had kept all her illusions. She tried to look",353
1391,"picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her name was Victoria,",353
1392,and she had a perfect mania for going to church.,353
1393,"“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”",354
1394,“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than,355
1395,anybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other,355
1396,"people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you",355
1397,"think so, Mr. Gray?”",355
1398,"The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her",356
1399,fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.,356
1400,"Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady",357
1401,"Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music. If one",357
1402,"hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”",357
1403,"“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I always hear",358
1404,Harry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to know of,358
1405,"them. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it, but I",358
1406,am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped,358
1407,"pianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know what it",358
1408,"is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,",358
1409,ain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after,358
1410,"a time, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to",358
1411,"art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to",358
1412,"any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford",358
1413,"orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms",358
1414,"look so picturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for",358
1415,"you, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray",358
1416,here. We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the,358
1417,same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different. But he has been,358
1418,most pleasant. I am so glad I’ve seen him.”,358
1419,"“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his",359
1420,"dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused",359
1421,"smile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old",359
1422,brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays,359
1423,people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”,359
1424,"“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an",360
1425,awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive,360
1426,"with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining",360
1427,"out, I suppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”",360
1428,"“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her",361
1429,"as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the",361
1430,"rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of",361
1431,frangipanni. Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the,361
1432,sofa.,361
1433,"“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a",362
1434,few puffs.,362
1435,"“Why, Harry?”",363
1436,“Because they are so sentimental.”,364
1437,“But I like sentimental people.”,365
1438,"“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,",366
1439,because they are curious: both are disappointed.”,366
1440,"“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That",367
1441,"is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do",367
1442,everything that you say.”,367
1443,“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.,368
1444,"“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.",369
1445,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace,370
1446,_début_.”,370
1447,"“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”",371
1448,“Who is she?”,372
1449,“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”,373
1450,“Never heard of her.”,374
1451,"“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”",375
1452,"“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They",376
1453,"never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent",376
1454,"the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of",376
1455,mind over morals.”,376
1456,"“Harry, how can you?”",377
1457,"“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so",378
1458,I ought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I,378
1459,"find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and",378
1460,the coloured. The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a,378
1461,"reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to",378
1462,"supper. The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake,",378
1463,however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers,378
1464,painted in order to try and talk brilliantly. _Rouge_ and _esprit_ used,378
1465,to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten,378
1466,"years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied. As for",378
1467,"conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and",378
1468,"two of these can’t be admitted into decent society. However, tell me",378
1469,about your genius. How long have you known her?”,378
1470,"“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”",379
1471,“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”,380
1472,“About three weeks.”,381
1473,“And where did you come across her?”,382
1474,"“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.",383
1475,"After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You",383
1476,filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life. For days,383
1477,"after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in",383
1478,"the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who",383
1479,"passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they",383
1480,led. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror. There,383
1481,was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations....,383
1482,"Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search",383
1483,"of some adventure. I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with",383
1484,"its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as",383
1485,"you once phrased it, must have something in store for me. I fancied a",383
1486,thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I,383
1487,remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we,383
1488,"first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret",383
1489,"of life. I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered",383
1490,"eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black",383
1491,grassless squares. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little,383
1492,"theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous",383
1493,"Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was",383
1494,"standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He had greasy ringlets,",383
1495,and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ‘Have a,383
1496,"box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an",383
1497,"air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him, Harry, that",383
1498,"amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I",383
1499,really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the,383
1500,present day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear,383
1501,"Harry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my",383
1502,life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”,383
1503,"“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you",384
1504,should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the,384
1505,"first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will",384
1506,always be in love with love. A _grande passion_ is the privilege of,384
1507,people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes,384
1508,of a country. Don’t be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for,384
1509,you. This is merely the beginning.”,384
1510,“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.,385
1511,“No; I think your nature so deep.”,386
1512,“How do you mean?”,387
1513,"“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really",388
1514,"the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I",388
1515,call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.,388
1516,Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life,388
1517,of the intellect—simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must,388
1518,analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many,388
1519,things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might,388
1520,pick them up. But I don’t want to interrupt you. Go on with your,388
1521,story.”,388
1522,"“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a",389
1523,vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the,389
1524,"curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and",389
1525,"cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were",389
1526,"fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and",389
1527,there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the,389
1528,"dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there",389
1529,was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”,389
1530,“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”,390
1531,"“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what",391
1532,on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you,391
1533,"think the play was, Harry?”",391
1534,"“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’. Our fathers",392
1535,"used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The longer I live, Dorian,",392
1536,the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is,392
1537,"not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont",392
1538,toujours tort_.”,392
1539,"“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I",393
1540,must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare,393
1541,"done in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a",393
1542,"sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There",393
1543,"was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a",393
1544,"cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene",393
1545,"was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,",393
1546,"with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a",393
1547,beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the,393
1548,"low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most",393
1549,friendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the,393
1550,"scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But",393
1551,"Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a",393
1552,"little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of",393
1553,"dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were",393
1554,like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen,393
1555,"in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that",393
1556,"beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,",393
1557,"Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came",393
1558,across me. And her voice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at,393
1559,"first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s",393
1560,"ear. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a",393
1561,distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy,393
1562,that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There,393
1563,"were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You",393
1564,know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane,393
1565,"are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear",393
1566,"them, and each of them says something different. I don’t know which to",393
1567,"follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is",393
1568,everything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One,393
1569,"evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have",393
1570,"seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from",393
1571,her lover’s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of,393
1572,"Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.",393
1573,"She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and",393
1574,given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been,393
1575,"innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike",393
1576,throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary,393
1577,women never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their,393
1578,century. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as,393
1579,easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is,393
1580,no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and,393
1581,chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped,393
1582,smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an,393
1583,actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why didn’t you tell me,393
1584,that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”,393
1585,"“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”",394
1586,"“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”",395
1587,“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary,396
1588,"charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.",396
1589,“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”,397
1590,"“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life",398
1591,you will tell me everything you do.”,398
1592,"“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.",399
1593,"You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would",399
1594,come and confess it to you. You would understand me.”,399
1595,"“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes,",400
1596,"Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same. And now",400
1597,"tell me—reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your",400
1598,actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”,400
1599,"Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.",401
1600,“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”,401
1601,"“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said",402
1602,"Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why",402
1603,should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When,402
1604,"one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one",402
1605,always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a,402
1606,"romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”",402
1607,"“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the",403
1608,horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and,403
1609,offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was,403
1610,"furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds",403
1611,of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I,403
1612,"think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the",403
1613,"impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”",403
1614,“I am not surprised.”,404
1615,“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I,405
1616,"never even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and",405
1617,confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy,405
1618,"against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”",405
1619,"“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other",406
1620,"hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all",406
1621,expensive.”,406
1622,"“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed Dorian.",407
1623,"“By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre,",407
1624,and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly,407
1625,"recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the",407
1626,"place again. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I",407
1627,"was a munificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though",407
1628,"he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with",407
1629,"an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The",407
1630,"Bard,’ as he insisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a",407
1631,distinction.”,407
1632,"“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction. Most people",408
1633,become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of,408
1634,life. To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour. But when did,408
1635,you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”,408
1636,“The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going,409
1637,"round. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me—at least",409
1638,I fancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed,409
1639,"determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not",409
1640,"wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”",409
1641,“No; I don’t think so.”,410
1642,"“My dear Harry, why?”",411
1643,“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.”,412
1644,"“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child",413
1645,about her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her,413
1646,"what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of",413
1647,her power. I think we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood,413
1648,"grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate",413
1649,"speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like",413
1650,"children. He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure",413
1651,"Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She said quite simply to me,",413
1652,‘You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.’”,413
1653,"“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”",414
1654,"“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a person in",415
1655,"a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded",415
1656,tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta,415
1657,"dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen",415
1658,better days.”,415
1659,"“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his",416
1660,rings.,416
1661,"“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest",417
1662,me.”,417
1663,“You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about,418
1664,other people’s tragedies.”,418
1665,“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came,419
1666,"from? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and",419
1667,"entirely divine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every",419
1668,night she is more marvellous.”,419
1669,"“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I",420
1670,thought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is,420
1671,not quite what I expected.”,420
1672,"“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have",421
1673,"been to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his",421
1674,blue eyes in wonder.,421
1675,“You always come dreadfully late.”,422
1676,"“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried, “even if it is",423
1677,only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think,423
1678,"of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I",423
1679,am filled with awe.”,423
1680,"“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”",424
1681,"He shook his head. “To-night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and",425
1682,to-morrow night she will be Juliet.”,425
1683,“When is she Sibyl Vane?”,426
1684,“Never.”,427
1685,“I congratulate you.”,428
1686,“How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.,429
1687,"She is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has",429
1688,"genius. I love her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the",429
1689,"secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to",429
1690,make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our,429
1691,laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their,429
1692,"dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. My God, Harry,",429
1693,how I worship her!” He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.,429
1694,Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was terribly excited.,429
1695,Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different,430
1696,he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s,430
1697,"studio! His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of",430
1698,"scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and",430
1699,desire had come to meet it on the way.,430
1700,“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.,431
1701,“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I,432
1702,have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to,432
1703,acknowledge her genius. Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands.,432
1704,She is bound to him for three years—at least for two years and eight,432
1705,"months—from the present time. I shall have to pay him something, of",432
1706,"course. When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and",432
1707,bring her out properly. She will make the world as mad as she has made,432
1708,me.”,432
1709,"“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”",433
1710,"“Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in",434
1711,"her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it",434
1712,"is personalities, not principles, that move the age.”",434
1713,"“Well, what night shall we go?”",435
1714,“Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet,436
1715,to-morrow.”,436
1716,“All right. The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”,437
1717,"“Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the",438
1718,"curtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets",438
1719,Romeo.”,438
1720,"“Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or",439
1721,reading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before,439
1722,seven. Shall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to,439
1723,him?”,439
1724,“Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather,440
1725,"horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful",440
1726,"frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous",440
1727,"of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit",440
1728,that I delight in it. Perhaps you had better write to him. I don’t want,440
1729,to see him alone. He says things that annoy me. He gives me good,440
1730,advice.”,440
1731,Lord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need,441
1732,most themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”,441
1733,"“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit",442
1734,"of a Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered",442
1735,that.”,442
1736,"“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his",443
1737,work. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his,443
1738,"prejudices, his principles, and his common sense. The only artists I",443
1739,have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists. Good,443
1740,"artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly",443
1741,"uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is",443
1742,the most unpoetical of all creatures. But inferior poets are absolutely,443
1743,"fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they",443
1744,look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets,443
1745,makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot,443
1746,write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”,443
1747,"“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some",444
1748,"perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that",444
1749,"stood on the table. “It must be, if you say it. And now I am off.",444
1750,Imogen is waiting for me. Don’t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.”,444
1751,"As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began",445
1752,to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as,445
1753,"Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused",445
1754,him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by,445
1755,it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled,445
1756,"by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of",445
1757,that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had,445
1758,"begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.",445
1759,Human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.,445
1760,Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as,445
1761,"one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one",445
1762,"could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous",445
1763,fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with,445
1764,monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle,445
1765,that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were,445
1766,maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to,445
1767,"understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!",445
1768,How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard,445
1769,"logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to",445
1770,"observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they",445
1771,"were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a",445
1772,delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too,445
1773,high a price for any sensation.,445
1774,He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his,446
1775,"brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical",446
1776,"words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned",446
1777,to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent,446
1778,the lad was his own creation. He had made him premature. That was,446
1779,something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its,446
1780,"secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were",446
1781,revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect,446
1782,"of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately",446
1783,with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex,446
1784,"personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed,",446
1785,"in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces,",446
1786,"just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.",446
1787,"Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was",447
1788,"yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was",447
1789,becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his,447
1790,"beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It",447
1791,"was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one",447
1792,"of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be",447
1793,"remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and",447
1794,whose wounds are like red roses.,447
1795,"Soul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were! There was",448
1796,"animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.",448
1797,"The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say",448
1798,"where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How",448
1799,shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And,448
1800,yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!,448
1801,Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body,448
1802,"really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit",448
1803,"from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a",448
1804,mystery also.,448
1805,He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a,449
1806,science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it,449
1807,"was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.",449
1808,Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to,449
1809,"their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of",449
1810,"warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation",449
1811,"of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow",449
1812,and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in,449
1813,experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.,449
1814,All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same,449
1815,"as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we",449
1816,"would do many times, and with joy.",449
1817,It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by,450
1818,which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and,450
1819,"certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to",450
1820,promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane,450
1821,was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt,450
1822,"that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new",450
1823,"experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex",450
1824,passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of,450
1825,"boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination,",450
1826,changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from,450
1827,"sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the",450
1828,passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most,450
1829,strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we,450
1830,were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were,450
1831,experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.,450
1832,"While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the",451
1833,"door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for",451
1834,dinner. He got up and looked out into the street. The sunset had,451
1835,smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The,451
1836,panes glowed like plates of heated metal. The sky above was like a,451
1837,faded rose. He thought of his friend’s young fiery-coloured life and,451
1838,wondered how it was all going to end.,451
1839,"When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram",452
1840,lying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian,452
1841,Gray. It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl,452
1842,Vane.,452
1843,CHAPTER V.,456
1844,"“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face",458
1845,"in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to",458
1846,"the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their",458
1847,"dingy sitting-room contained. “I am so happy!” she repeated, “and you",458
1848,"must be happy, too!”",458
1849,"Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her",459
1850,"daughter’s head. “Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I",459
1851,see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr. Isaacs,459
1852,"has been very good to us, and we owe him money.”",459
1853,"The girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does",460
1854,money matter? Love is more than money.”,460
1855,“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to,461
1856,"get a proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty",461
1857,pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”,461
1858,"“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,”",462
1859,"said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.",462
1860,"“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the elder",463
1861,woman querulously.,463
1862,"Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. “We don’t want him any more,",464
1863,Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused. A rose,464
1864,shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the,464
1865,petals of her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept,464
1866,"over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress. “I love him,” she",464
1867,said simply.,464
1868,“Foolish child! foolish child!” was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.,465
1869,"The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the",465
1870,words.,465
1871,The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her,466
1872,"eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a",466
1873,"moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a",466
1874,dream had passed across them.,466
1875,"Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at",467
1876,"prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name",467
1877,of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of,467
1878,"passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on",467
1879,"memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it",467
1880,had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids,467
1881,were warm with his breath.,467
1882,Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This,468
1883,"young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against",468
1884,the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of,468
1885,"craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.",468
1886,Suddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.,469
1887,"“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I know why I",469
1888,love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.,469
1889,"But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet—why, I",469
1890,"cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I",469
1891,"feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love",469
1892,Prince Charming?”,469
1893,The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her,470
1894,"cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to",470
1895,"her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me,",470
1896,Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains,470
1897,you because you loved him so much. Don’t look so sad. I am as happy,470
1898,to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!”,470
1899,"“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,",471
1900,what do you know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The,471
1901,"whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away",471
1902,"to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you",471
1903,"should have shown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he",471
1904,is rich ...”,471
1905,"“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”",472
1906,"Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical",473
1907,gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a,473
1908,"stage-player, clasped her in her arms. At this moment, the door opened",473
1909,and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He was,473
1910,"thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat",473
1911,clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister. One would,473
1912,hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.,473
1913,Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally,473
1914,elevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the,473
1915,_tableau_ was interesting.,473
1916,"“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the",474
1917,lad with a good-natured grumble.,474
1918,"“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried. “You are a",475
1919,dreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and hugged him.,475
1920,James Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want you,476
1921,"to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever see",476
1922,this horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”,476
1923,"“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up",477
1924,"a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it. She",477
1925,felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would,477
1926,have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.,477
1927,"“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”",478
1928,"“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a",479
1929,position of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the,479
1930,Colonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made your,479
1931,"fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”",479
1932,“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know anything about that.,480
1933,I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I,480
1934,hate it.”,480
1935,"“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are you really",481
1936,going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were,481
1937,"going to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave",481
1938,"you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking",481
1939,it. It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where,481
1940,shall we go? Let us go to the park.”,481
1941,"“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people go to the",482
1942,park.”,482
1943,"“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.",483
1944,"He hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be",484
1945,too long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could hear her,484
1946,singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.,484
1947,He walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to,485
1948,"the still figure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.",485
1949,"“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work. For",486
1950,some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this,486
1951,rough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when,486
1952,their eyes met. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The,486
1953,"silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.",486
1954,"She began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as",486
1955,they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you will be,486
1956,"contented, James, with your sea-faring life,” she said. “You must",486
1957,remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a,486
1958,"solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the",486
1959,country often dine with the best families.”,486
1960,"“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are quite",487
1961,"right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don’t",487
1962,"let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”",487
1963,"“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over Sibyl.”",488
1964,“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to,489
1965,talk to her. Is that right? What about that?”,489
1966,"“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the",490
1967,profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying,490
1968,attention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was,490
1969,"when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at",490
1970,present whether her attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt,490
1971,that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He is always,490
1972,"most polite to me. Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and",490
1973,the flowers he sends are lovely.”,490
1974,"“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.",491
1975,"“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face. “He has",492
1976,not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of him. He,492
1977,is probably a member of the aristocracy.”,492
1978,"James Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch",493
1979,over her.”,493
1980,"“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special",494
1981,"care. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why",494
1982,she should not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the,494
1983,"aristocracy. He has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a",494
1984,most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.,494
1985,His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”,494
1986,The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane,495
1987,with his coarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when,495
1988,the door opened and Sibyl ran in.,495
1989,“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the matter?”,496
1990,"“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious sometimes.",497
1991,"Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock. Everything is",497
1992,"packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”",497
1993,"“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.",498
1994,"She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and",499
1995,there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.,499
1996,"“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the",500
1997,withered cheek and warmed its frost.,500
1998,"“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in",501
1999,search of an imaginary gallery.,501
2000,"“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his mother’s",502
2001,affectations.,502
2002,"They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled",503
2003,down the dreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the,503
2004,"sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the",503
2005,"company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl. He was like a common",503
2006,gardener walking with a rose.,503
2007,Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of,504
2008,"some stranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on",504
2009,"geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however,",504
2010,was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing. Her love was,504
2011,"trembling in laughter on her lips. She was thinking of Prince Charming,",504
2012,"and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him,",504
2013,"but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about",504
2014,"the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life",504
2015,"he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For he was not",504
2016,"to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.",504
2017,"Oh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a",504
2018,"horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a",504
2019,black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long,504
2020,"screaming ribands! He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a",504
2021,"polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.",504
2022,Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure,504
2023,"gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it",504
2024,down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen. The,504
2025,"bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with",504
2026,"immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.",504
2027,"They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other",504
2028,"in bar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer,",504
2029,"and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful",504
2030,"heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase,",504
2031,"and rescue her. Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with",504
2032,"her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense",504
2033,"house in London. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.",504
2034,"But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money",504
2035,"foolishly. She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much",504
2036,"more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and",504
2037,to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was very,504
2038,"good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a",504
2039,few years he would come back quite rich and happy.,504
2040,The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick,505
2041,at leaving home.,505
2042,Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.,506
2043,"Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger",506
2044,of Sibyl’s position. This young dandy who was making love to her could,506
2045,"mean her no good. He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated",506
2046,"him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account,",506
2047,and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him. He was,506
2048,"conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature,",506
2049,and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.,506
2050,Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge,506
2051,them; sometimes they forgive them.,506
2052,"His mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that",507
2053,he had brooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he,507
2054,"had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears",507
2055,"one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of",507
2056,horrible thoughts. He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a,507
2057,hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit together into a wedge-like,507
2058,"furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.",507
2059,"“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I",508
2060,am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say something.”,508
2061,“What do you want me to say?”,509
2062,"“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,",510
2063,smiling at him.,510
2064,He shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am,511
2065,"to forget you, Sibyl.”",511
2066,"She flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.",512
2067,"“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me",513
2068,about him? He means you no good.”,513
2069,"“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything against him. I",514
2070,love him.”,514
2071,"“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad. “Who is he? I",515
2072,have a right to know.”,515
2073,“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name? Oh! you silly,516
2074,"boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think",516
2075,him the most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet,516
2076,him—when you come back from Australia. You will like him so much.,516
2077,"Everybody likes him, and I ... love him. I wish you could come to the",516
2078,"theatre to-night. He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh!",516
2079,"how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have",516
2080,him sitting there! To play for his delight! I am afraid I may frighten,516
2081,"the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass",516
2082,one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his,516
2083,loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will,516
2084,"announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his only,",516
2085,"Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor",516
2086,beside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the,516
2087,"door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.",516
2088,"They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I",516
2089,"think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”",516
2090,"“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.",517
2091,“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you want?”,518
2092,“He wants to enslave you.”,519
2093,“I shudder at the thought of being free.”,520
2094,“I want you to beware of him.”,521
2095,“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”,522
2096,"“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”",523
2097,"She laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you",524
2098,were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will,524
2099,know what it is. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to,524
2100,"think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have",524
2101,"ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and",524
2102,"difficult. But it will be different now. You are going to a new world,",524
2103,and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the,524
2104,smart people go by.”,524
2105,They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across,525
2106,the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—tremulous,525
2107,cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. The brightly,525
2108,coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.,525
2109,"She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He",526
2110,spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as,526
2111,players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not,526
2112,communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all,526
2113,the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she,526
2114,"caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open",526
2115,carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.,526
2116,She started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.,527
2117,“Who?” said Jim Vane.,528
2118,"“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.",529
2119,He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which,530
2120,is he? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment,530
2121,"the Duke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left",530
2122,"the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.",530
2123,"“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”",531
2124,"“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does",532
2125,"you any wrong, I shall kill him.”",532
2126,She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air,533
2127,like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to,533
2128,her tittered.,533
2129,"“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her doggedly as",534
2130,she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.,534
2131,"When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity",535
2132,in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at,535
2133,"him. “You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that",535
2134,is all. How can you say such horrible things? You don’t know what you,535
2135,are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you,535
2136,"would fall in love. Love makes people good, and what you said was",535
2137,wicked.”,535
2138,"“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about. Mother is no",536
2139,help to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I wish now,536
2140,that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck,536
2141,"the whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”",536
2142,"“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of those",537
2143,silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going,537
2144,"to quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect",537
2145,happiness. We won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I,537
2146,"love, would you?”",537
2147,"“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.",538
2148,“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.,539
2149,“And he?”,540
2150,"“For ever, too!”",541
2151,“He had better.”,542
2152,She shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He,543
2153,was merely a boy.,543
2154,"At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to",544
2155,"their shabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and",544
2156,Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted,544
2157,that she should do so. He said that he would sooner part with her when,544
2158,"their mother was not present. She would be sure to make a scene, and he",544
2159,detested scenes of every kind.,544
2160,"In Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s heart,",545
2161,"and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,",545
2162,"had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck,",545
2163,"and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her",545
2164,with real affection. There were tears in his eyes as he went,545
2165,downstairs.,545
2166,His mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his,546
2167,"unpunctuality, as he entered. He made no answer, but sat down to his",546
2168,meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the,546
2169,"stained cloth. Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of",546
2170,"street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that",546
2171,was left to him.,546
2172,"After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his",547
2173,hands. He felt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to,547
2174,"him before, if it was as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother",547
2175,watched him. Words dropped mechanically from her lips. A tattered lace,547
2176,"handkerchief twitched in her fingers. When the clock struck six, he got",547
2177,up and went to the door. Then he turned back and looked at her. Their,547
2178,eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him.,547
2179,"“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered",548
2180,vaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have,548
2181,a right to know. Were you married to my father?”,548
2182,"She heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment,",549
2183,"the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded,",549
2184,"had come at last, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure",549
2185,it was a disappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question,549
2186,called for a direct answer. The situation had not been gradually led up,549
2187,to. It was crude. It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.,549
2188,"“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.",550
2189,"“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists.",551
2190,She shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very,552
2191,"much. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak",552
2192,"against him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he",552
2193,was highly connected.”,552
2194,"An oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed,",553
2195,"“but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love",553
2196,"with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.”",553
2197,For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her,554
2198,head drooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a,554
2199,"mother,” she murmured; “I had none.”",554
2200,"The lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed",555
2201,"her. “I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he",555
2202,"said, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don’t forget",555
2203,"that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me",555
2204,"that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him",555
2205,"down, and kill him like a dog. I swear it.”",555
2206,"The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that",556
2207,"accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid",556
2208,"to her. She was familiar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely,",556
2209,and for the first time for many months she really admired her son. She,556
2210,would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional,556
2211,"scale, but he cut her short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers",556
2212,looked for. The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the,556
2213,bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details. It,556
2214,was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the,556
2215,"tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away. She",556
2216,was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled,556
2217,"herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now",556
2218,that she had only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase.,556
2219,It had pleased her. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and,556
2220,dramatically expressed. She felt that they would all laugh at it some,556
2221,day.,556
2222,CHAPTER VI.,560
2223,"“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that",562
2224,evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol,562
2225,where dinner had been laid for three.,562
2226,"“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing",563
2227,"waiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don’t",563
2228,interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons,563
2229,"worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little",563
2230,whitewashing.”,563
2231,"“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him",564
2232,as he spoke.,564
2233,Hallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!” he,565
2234,cried. “Impossible!”,565
2235,“It is perfectly true.”,566
2236,“To whom?”,567
2237,“To some little actress or other.”,568
2238,“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”,569
2239,"“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear",570
2240,Basil.”,570
2241,"“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”",571
2242,"“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I didn’t say",572
2243,he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is a great,572
2244,"difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have",572
2245,no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I,572
2246,never was engaged.”,572
2247,"“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be",573
2248,absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”,573
2249,"“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is",574
2250,"sure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it",574
2251,is always from the noblest motives.”,574
2252,"“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to",575
2253,"some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his",575
2254,intellect.”,575
2255,"“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry,",576
2256,sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she is,576
2257,"beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your",576
2258,portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal,576
2259,"appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst",576
2260,"others. We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his",576
2261,appointment.”,576
2262,“Are you serious?”,577
2263,"“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever",578
2264,be more serious than I am at the present moment.”,578
2265,"“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and",579
2266,"down the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it, possibly.",579
2267,It is some silly infatuation.”,579
2268,"“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd",580
2269,attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air,580
2270,our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people,580
2271,"say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a",580
2272,"personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality",580
2273,selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with,580
2274,"a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not?",580
2275,"If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting. You know",580
2276,I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that,580
2277,it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack,580
2278,"individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage",580
2279,"makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other",580
2280,egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more,580
2281,"highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the",580
2282,"object of man’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and",580
2283,"whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I",580
2284,"hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore",580
2285,"her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one",580
2286,else. He would be a wonderful study.”,580
2287,"“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.",581
2288,"If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than",581
2289,yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”,581
2290,Lord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others,582
2291,is that we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer,582
2292,terror. We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour,582
2293,with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to,582
2294,"us. We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find",582
2295,good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our,582
2296,pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest,582
2297,"contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but",582
2298,"one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have",582
2299,"merely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly,",582
2300,but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I,582
2301,will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being,582
2302,fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He will tell you more than I,582
2303,can.”,582
2304,"“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the",583
2305,"lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and",583
2306,shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so,583
2307,"happy. Of course, it is sudden—all really delightful things are. And",583
2308,yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my,583
2309,"life.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked",583
2310,extraordinarily handsome.,583
2311,"“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I",584
2312,don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.,584
2313,You let Harry know.”,584
2314,"“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord",585
2315,"Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.",585
2316,"“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and",585
2317,then you will tell us how it all came about.”,585
2318,"“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their",586
2319,seats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I,586
2320,"left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that",586
2321,"little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and",586
2322,went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind.,586
2323,"Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!",586
2324,"You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she",586
2325,was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with,586
2326,"cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little",586
2327,"green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak",586
2328,lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had,586
2329,all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your,586
2330,"studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round",586
2331,"a pale rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night. She is",586
2332,simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I,586
2333,forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away,586
2334,with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the,586
2335,"performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were",586
2336,"sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had",586
2337,never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each,586
2338,other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to,586
2339,me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of,586
2340,rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a white,586
2341,narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I,586
2342,"feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of",586
2343,"course, our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own",586
2344,mother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to,586
2345,"be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and",586
2346,"then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take",586
2347,my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips,586
2348,that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.,586
2349,"I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the",586
2350,mouth.”,586
2351,"“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.",587
2352,“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.,588
2353,Dorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall,589
2354,find her in an orchard in Verona.”,589
2355,Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what,590
2356,"particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what",590
2357,did she say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”,590
2358,"“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did",591
2359,"not make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said",591
2360,"she was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is",591
2361,nothing to me compared with her.”,591
2362,"“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more",592
2363,practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to,592
2364,"say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”",592
2365,"Hallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have annoyed",593
2366,Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any,593
2367,one. His nature is too fine for that.”,593
2368,"Lord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with me,”",594
2369,"he answered. “I asked the question for the best reason possible, for",594
2370,"the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any",594
2371,question—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women,594
2372,"who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of",594
2373,"course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not",594
2374,modern.”,594
2375,"Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,",595
2376,Harry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When,595
2377,"you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her",595
2378,"would be a beast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any",595
2379,one can wish to shame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to,595
2380,place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman,595
2381,who is mine. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for,595
2382,that. Ah! don’t mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take. Her,595
2383,"trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good. When I am with her,",595
2384,I regret all that you have taught me. I become different from what you,595
2385,"have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s",595
2386,"hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous,",595
2387,delightful theories.”,595
2388,"“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.",596
2389,"“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories",597
2390,"about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”",597
2391,"“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered",598
2392,in his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory,598
2393,"as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s test,",598
2394,"her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when",598
2395,"we are good, we are not always happy.”",598
2396,“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.,599
2397,"“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord",600
2398,Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the,600
2399,"centre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”",600
2400,"“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching",601
2401,"the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.",601
2402,“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own,601
2403,"life—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours,",601
2404,"if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral",601
2405,"views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,",601
2406,individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in,601
2407,accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of,601
2408,culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest,601
2409,immorality.”,601
2410,"“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a",602
2411,terrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.,602
2412,"“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that",603
2413,the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but,603
2414,"self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege",603
2415,of the rich.”,603
2416,“One has to pay in other ways but money.”,604
2417,"“What sort of ways, Basil?”",605
2418,"“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the",606
2419,consciousness of degradation.”,606
2420,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is",607
2421,"charming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in",607
2422,"fiction, of course. But then the only things that one can use in",607
2423,"fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me,",607
2424,"no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever",607
2425,knows what a pleasure is.”,607
2426,"“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore some",608
2427,one.”,608
2428,"“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with",609
2429,some fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as,609
2430,"humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us",609
2431,to do something for them.”,609
2432,“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to,610
2433,"us,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures. They",610
2434,have a right to demand it back.”,610
2435,"“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.",611
2436,"“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.",612
2437,"“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that women give",613
2438,to men the very gold of their lives.”,613
2439,"“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very",614
2440,"small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once",614
2441,"put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always",614
2442,prevent us from carrying them out.”,614
2443,"“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so much.”",615
2444,"“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have some",616
2445,"coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and",616
2446,"some cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil, I",616
2447,can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette,616
2448,"is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it",616
2449,"leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will",616
2450,always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never,616
2451,had the courage to commit.”,616
2452,"“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a",617
2453,fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.,617
2454,“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will,617
2455,have a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you,617
2456,have never known.”,617
2457,"“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his",618
2458,"eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,",618
2459,"that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful",618
2460,girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life.,618
2461,"Let us go. Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but",618
2462,there is only room for two in the brougham. You must follow us in a,618
2463,hansom.”,618
2464,"They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The",619
2465,painter was silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He,619
2466,"could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better",619
2467,"than many other things that might have happened. After a few minutes,",619
2468,"they all passed downstairs. He drove off by himself, as had been",619
2469,"arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in",619
2470,front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt that,619
2471,Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the,619
2472,"past. Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded",619
2473,flaring streets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the,619
2474,"theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.",619
2475,CHAPTER VII.,623
2476,"For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat",625
2477,Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with,625
2478,an oily tremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of,625
2479,"pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top",625
2480,of his voice. Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever. He felt as if he,625
2481,"had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban. Lord Henry,",625
2482,"upon the other hand, rather liked him. At least he declared he did, and",625
2483,insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud,625
2484,to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a,625
2485,poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The,625
2486,"heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a",625
2487,monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery,625
2488,had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.,625
2489,They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges,625
2490,with the tawdry girls who sat beside them. Some women were laughing in,625
2491,the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of,625
2492,the popping of corks came from the bar.,625
2493,“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.,626
2494,"“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and she is",627
2495,"divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget",627
2496,"everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and",627
2497,"brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They",627
2498,sit silently and watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to,627
2499,"do. She makes them as responsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them,",627
2500,and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”,627
2501,"“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed",628
2502,"Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his",628
2503,opera-glass.,628
2504,"“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter. “I",629
2505,"understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love",629
2506,"must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must",629
2507,be fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth,629
2508,doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without,629
2509,"one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have",629
2510,"been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and",629
2511,"lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of",629
2512,"all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage",629
2513,"is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The",629
2514,gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been,629
2515,incomplete.”,629
2516,"“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. “I knew that",630
2517,"you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But here",630
2518,"is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about",630
2519,"five minutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom",630
2520,"I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is",630
2521,good in me.”,630
2522,"A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of",631
2523,"applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly",631
2524,"lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought,",631
2525,that he had ever seen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace,631
2526,"and startled eyes. A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror",631
2527,"of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded",631
2528,enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to,631
2529,tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.,631
2530,"Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her. Lord",631
2531,"Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming! charming!”",631
2532,"The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s",632
2533,"dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The band, such",632
2534,"as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began. Through",632
2535,"the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a",632
2536,"creature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a",632
2537,plant sways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a,632
2538,white lily. Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.,632
2539,Yet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes,633
2540,rested on Romeo. The few words she had to speak—,633
2541,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,",634
2542,    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;,634
2543,"For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,",634
2544,    And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—,634
2545,"with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly",636
2546,"artificial manner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view",636
2547,of tone it was absolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away,636
2548,all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal.,636
2549,Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious.,637
2550,Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them,637
2551,to be absolutely incompetent. They were horribly disappointed.,637
2552,Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of,638
2553,"the second act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was",638
2554,nothing in her.,638
2555,She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be,639
2556,"denied. But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse",639
2557,as she went on. Her gestures became absurdly artificial. She,639
2558,overemphasized everything that she had to say. The beautiful passage—,639
2559,"Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,",640
2560,Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek,640
2561,For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—,640
2562,was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been,642
2563,taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she,642
2564,leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines—,642
2565,"Although I joy in thee,",643
2566,I have no joy of this contract to-night:,643
2567,"It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;",643
2568,"Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be",643
2569,"Ere one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good-night!",643
2570,This bud of love by summer’s ripening breath,643
2571,May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—,643
2572,she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was,645
2573,"not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely",645
2574,self-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.,645
2575,Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their,646
2576,"interest in the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and",646
2577,"to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the",646
2578,"dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage. The only person unmoved was",646
2579,the girl herself.,646
2580,"When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord",647
2581,Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat. “She is quite,647
2582,"beautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act. Let us go.”",647
2583,"“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard",648
2584,bitter voice. “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an,648
2585,"evening, Harry. I apologize to you both.”",648
2586,"“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted",649
2587,Hallward. “We will come some other night.”,649
2588,"“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to be simply",650
2589,callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a great,650
2590,artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”,650
2591,"“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more",651
2592,wonderful thing than art.”,651
2593,"“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry. “But do",652
2594,"let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good",652
2595,"for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will",652
2596,"want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like",652
2597,"a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about",652
2598,"life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.",652
2599,There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people,652
2600,"who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.",652
2601,"Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of",652
2602,remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to,652
2603,the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to,652
2604,the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?”,652
2605,"“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil, you must",653
2606,go. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to,653
2607,"his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he",653
2608,"leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.",653
2609,"“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his",654
2610,"voice, and the two young men passed out together.",654
2611,A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose,655
2612,"on the third act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale,",655
2613,"and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed",655
2614,"interminable. Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots",655
2615,and laughing. The whole thing was a _fiasco_. The last act was played,655
2616,to almost empty benches. The curtain went down on a titter and some,655
2617,groans.,655
2618,"As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the",656
2619,"greenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on",656
2620,her face. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a,656
2621,radiance about her. Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of,656
2622,their own.,656
2623,"When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy",657
2624,"came over her. “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.",657
2625,"“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement. “Horribly! It was",658
2626,dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea,658
2627,what I suffered.”,658
2628,"The girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with",659
2629,"long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to",659
2630,"the red petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But",659
2631,"you understand now, don’t you?”",659
2632,"“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.",660
2633,“Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall,661
2634,never act well again.”,661
2635,"He shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill",662
2636,you shouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored.,662
2637,I was bored.”,662
2638,She seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An,663
2639,ecstasy of happiness dominated her.,663
2640,"“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one",664
2641,reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought,664
2642,that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.,664
2643,"The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine",664
2644,also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me,664
2645,seemed to me to be godlike. The painted scenes were my world. I knew,664
2646,"nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came—oh, my beautiful",664
2647,love!—and you freed my soul from prison. You taught me what reality,664
2648,"really is. To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the",664
2649,"hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had",664
2650,"always played. To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that",664
2651,"the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the",664
2652,"orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I",664
2653,"had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to",664
2654,"say. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is",664
2655,but a reflection. You had made me understand what love really is. My,664
2656,love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of,664
2657,shadows. You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do,664
2658,"with the puppets of a play? When I came on to-night, I could not",664
2659,understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that,664
2660,I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly,664
2661,it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to,664
2662,"me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love",664
2663,"such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can",664
2664,be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not,664
2665,"feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian,",664
2666,"Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it",664
2667,would be profanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me,664
2668,see that.”,664
2669,He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have,665
2670,"killed my love,” he muttered.",665
2671,She looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came,666
2672,"across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt",666
2673,"down and pressed his hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a",666
2674,shudder ran through him.,666
2675,"Then he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you have",667
2676,killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even,667
2677,stir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because,667
2678,"you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you",667
2679,realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the,667
2680,shadows of art. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and,667
2681,stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you! What a fool I have been! You,667
2682,are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think,667
2683,of you. I will never mention your name. You don’t know what you were to,667
2684,"me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I wish I had",667
2685,never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How,667
2686,"little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art! Without your",667
2687,"art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid,",667
2688,"magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have",667
2689,borne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty,667
2690,face.”,667
2691,"The girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and",668
2692,"her voice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”",668
2693,she murmured. “You are acting.”,668
2694,"“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered bitterly.",669
2695,"She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her",670
2696,"face, came across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and",670
2697,looked into his eyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried.,670
2698,"A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay",671
2699,"there like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she",671
2700,whispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you all,671
2701,"the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across",671
2702,"me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had",671
2703,"not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.",671
2704,Don’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away from me.,671
2705,My brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in jest....,671
2706,"But you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and",671
2707,"try to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than",671
2708,"anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not",671
2709,"pleased you. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown",671
2710,"myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help",671
2711,"it. Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing",671
2712,"choked her. She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian",671
2713,"Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled",671
2714,lips curled in exquisite disdain. There is always something ridiculous,671
2715,about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane,671
2716,seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic. Her tears and sobs annoyed,671
2717,him.,671
2718,"“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I don’t wish to",672
2719,"be unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have disappointed me.”",672
2720,"She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little",673
2721,"hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He",673
2722,turned on his heel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of,673
2723,the theatre.,673
2724,Where he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly,674
2725,"lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking",674
2726,houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after,674
2727,"him. Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like",674
2728,"monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps,",674
2729,and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.,674
2730,"As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.",675
2731,"The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed",675
2732,itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies,675
2733,rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with,675
2734,"the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an",675
2735,anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market and watched the men,675
2736,unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some,675
2737,"cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money",675
2738,"for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at",675
2739,"midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long",675
2740,"line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red",675
2741,"roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge,",675
2742,"jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey,",675
2743,"sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls,",675
2744,waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging,675
2745,doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped,675
2746,"and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.",675
2747,Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked,675
2748,"and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.",675
2749,"After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few",676
2750,"moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent",676
2751,"square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.",676
2752,"The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like",676
2753,silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke,676
2754,"was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.",676
2755,"In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that",677
2756,"hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance,",677
2757,lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals,677
2758,"of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire. He turned them out and,",677
2759,"having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library",677
2760,"towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the",677
2761,"ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had",677
2762,decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries,677
2763,that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal. As,677
2764,"he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait",677
2765,Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.,677
2766,"Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he",677
2767,"had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.",677
2768,"Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. In",677
2769,the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk,677
2770,"blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. The expression",677
2771,looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty,677
2772,in the mouth. It was certainly strange.,677
2773,"He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The",678
2774,bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky,678
2775,"corners, where they lay shuddering. But the strange expression that he",678
2776,"had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be",678
2777,more intensified even. The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the,678
2778,lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking,678
2779,into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.,678
2780,"He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory",679
2781,"Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly",679
2782,into its polished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What,679
2783,did it mean?,679
2784,"He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it",680
2785,again. There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual,680
2786,"painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had",680
2787,altered. It was not a mere fancy of his own. The thing was horribly,680
2788,apparent.,680
2789,He threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there,681
2790,flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the,681
2791,"day the picture had been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He",681
2792,"had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the",681
2793,"portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the",681
2794,face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that,681
2795,the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and,681
2796,"thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness",681
2797,of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been,681
2798,fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to,681
2799,"think of them. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the",681
2800,touch of cruelty in the mouth.,681
2801,"Cruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had",682
2802,"dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he",682
2803,had thought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been,682
2804,"shallow and unworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over",682
2805,"him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little",682
2806,child. He remembered with what callousness he had watched her. Why had,682
2807,he been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him? But he,682
2808,had suffered also. During the three terrible hours that the play had,682
2809,"lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture. His",682
2810,"life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if he had",682
2811,"wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear",682
2812,sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of,682
2813,"their emotions. When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one",682
2814,"with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and",682
2815,Lord Henry knew what women were. Why should he trouble about Sibyl,682
2816,Vane? She was nothing to him now.,682
2817,But the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his,683
2818,"life, and told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty.",683
2819,Would it teach him to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it,683
2820,again?,683
2821,No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The,684
2822,horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly,684
2823,there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men,684
2824,mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.,684
2825,"Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel",685
2826,smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met,685
2827,"his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted",685
2828,"image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would",685
2829,alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses,685
2830,"would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and",685
2831,"wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or",685
2832,"unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would",685
2833,"resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at",685
2834,"any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil",685
2835,Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for,685
2836,"impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends,",685
2837,"marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She",685
2838,must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish,685
2839,and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would,685
2840,return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be,685
2841,beautiful and pure.,685
2842,He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the,686
2843,"portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he murmured",686
2844,"to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he",686
2845,"stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning",686
2846,air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of,686
2847,Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name,686
2848,over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched,686
2849,garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.,686
2850,CHAPTER VIII.,690
2851,It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times,692
2852,"on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered",692
2853,"what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and",692
2854,"Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a",692
2855,"small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains,",692
2856,"with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall",692
2857,windows.,692
2858,"“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.",693
2859,"“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.",694
2860,"“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”",695
2861,"How late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his",696
2862,"letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand",696
2863,"that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The",696
2864,others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of,696
2865,"cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of",696
2866,"charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young",696
2867,men every morning during the season. There was a rather heavy bill for,696
2868,a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the,696
2869,"courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned",696
2870,people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary,696
2871,things are our only necessities; and there were several very,696
2872,courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders,696
2873,offering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the,696
2874,most reasonable rates of interest.,696
2875,"After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate",697
2876,"dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the",697
2877,onyx-paved bathroom. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.,697
2878,He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense,697
2879,"of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice,",697
2880,but there was the unreality of a dream about it.,697
2881,"As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a",698
2882,light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round,698
2883,table close to the open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air,698
2884,seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the,698
2885,"blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before",698
2886,him. He felt perfectly happy.,698
2887,Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the,699
2888,"portrait, and he started.",699
2889,"“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the",700
2890,table. “I shut the window?”,700
2891,"Dorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured.",701
2892,Was it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply,702
2893,his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there,702
2894,had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The,702
2895,thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It,702
2896,would make him smile.,702
2897,"And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in",703
2898,"the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of",703
2899,cruelty round the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the,703
2900,room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the,703
2901,portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes,703
2902,"had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to",703
2903,"tell him to remain. As the door was closing behind him, he called him",703
2904,back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian looked at him for a,703
2905,"moment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh. The",703
2906,man bowed and retired.,703
2907,"Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on",704
2908,a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen,704
2909,"was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a",704
2910,"rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously,",704
2911,wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life.,704
2912,"Should he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was",705
2913,"the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was",705
2914,"not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier",705
2915,"chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?",705
2916,What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own,705
2917,picture? Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be,705
2918,"examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful",705
2919,state of doubt.,705
2920,He got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he,706
2921,looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and,706
2922,saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had,706
2923,altered.,706
2924,"As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he",707
2925,found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost,707
2926,scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was,707
2927,incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle,707
2928,affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form,707
2929,and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him? Could it be,707
2930,"that what that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they",707
2931,"made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered,",707
2932,"and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the",707
2933,picture in sickened horror.,707
2934,"One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him",708
2935,"conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not",708
2936,too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His,708
2937,"unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be",708
2938,"transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil",708
2939,"Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would",708
2940,"be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the",708
2941,"fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could",708
2942,lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the,708
2943,degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men,708
2944,brought upon their souls.,708
2945,"Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double",709
2946,"chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the",709
2947,scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his,709
2948,way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was,709
2949,"wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he",709
2950,went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had,709
2951,"loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness. He",709
2952,covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of,709
2953,"pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we",709
2954,"feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession,",709
2955,"not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the",709
2956,"letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.",709
2957,"Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s",710
2958,"voice outside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t",710
2959,bear your shutting yourself up like this.”,710
2960,"He made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking",711
2961,"still continued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry",711
2962,"in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel",711
2963,"with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was",711
2964,"inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture,",711
2965,and unlocked the door.,711
2966,"“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered. “But",712
2967,you must not think too much about it.”,712
2968,“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.,713
2969,"“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly",714
2970,"pulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of view,",714
2971,"but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her,",714
2972,after the play was over?”,714
2973,“Yes.”,715
2974,“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”,716
2975,"“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am",717
2976,not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know,717
2977,myself better.”,717
2978,"“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would",718
2979,find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”,718
2980,"“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and",719
2981,"smiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin",719
2982,with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in,719
2983,"us. Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me. I want",719
2984,to be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”,719
2985,"“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you",720
2986,on it. But how are you going to begin?”,720
2987,“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”,721
2988,"“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him",722
2989,"in perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”",722
2990,"“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about",723
2991,marriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.,723
2992,Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word,723
2993,to her. She is to be my wife.”,723
2994,“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you this,724
2995,"morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”",724
2996,"“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was",725
2997,afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut,725
2998,life to pieces with your epigrams.”,725
2999,“You know nothing then?”,726
3000,“What do you mean?”,727
3001,"Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray,",728
3002,"took both his hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he",728
3003,"said, “my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is",728
3004,dead.”,728
3005,"A cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,",729
3006,tearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead! It,729
3007,is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”,729
3008,"“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is in all the",730
3009,morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till,730
3010,"I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not",730
3011,be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.,730
3012,"But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make",730
3013,one’s _début_ with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an,730
3014,interest to one’s old age. I suppose they don’t know your name at the,730
3015,"theatre? If they don’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going",730
3016,round to her room? That is an important point.”,730
3017,Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror.,731
3018,"Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an",731
3019,"inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear",731
3020,it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.”,731
3021,"“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put",732
3022,in that way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre,732
3023,"with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had",732
3024,"forgotten something upstairs. They waited some time for her, but she",732
3025,did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the,732
3026,"floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake,",732
3027,"some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don’t know what it was, but",732
3028,it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was,732
3029,"prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”",732
3030,"“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.",733
3031,"“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed",734
3032,up in it. I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen. I should have,734
3033,"thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and",734
3034,"seemed to know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this",734
3035,"thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and",734
3036,"afterwards we will look in at the opera. It is a Patti night, and",734
3037,everybody will be there. You can come to my sister’s box. She has got,734
3038,some smart women with her.”,734
3039,"“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,",735
3040,“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.,735
3041,Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as,735
3042,"happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go",735
3043,"on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How",735
3044,"extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book,",735
3045,"Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has",735
3046,"happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.",735
3047,Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my,735
3048,"life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been",735
3049,"addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent",735
3050,"people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh,",735
3051,"Harry, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was",735
3052,everything to me. Then came that dreadful night—was it really only last,735
3053,"night?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She",735
3054,explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a,735
3055,bit. I thought her shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me,735
3056,"afraid. I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible. I said I",735
3057,would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My,735
3058,"God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don’t know the danger I am in,",735
3059,and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for,735
3060,me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.”,735
3061,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case",736
3062,"and producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever",736
3063,reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible,736
3064,"interest in life. If you had married this girl, you would have been",736
3065,"wretched. Of course, you would have treated her kindly. One can always",736
3066,be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon,736
3067,found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman,736
3068,"finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy,",736
3069,or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay,736
3070,"for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been",736
3071,"abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but I assure you that",736
3072,in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”,736
3073,"“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room",737
3074,and looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not my,737
3075,fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.,737
3076,I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good,737
3077,resolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.”,737
3078,“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific,738
3079,laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely _nil_.,738
3080,"They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions",738
3081,that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said,738
3082,for them. They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they,738
3083,have no account.”,738
3084,"“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him,",739
3085,“why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I,739
3086,don’t think I am heartless. Do you?”,739
3087,“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be,740
3088,"entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with",740
3089,his sweet melancholy smile.,740
3090,"The lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined,",741
3091,“but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am nothing of the,741
3092,kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has,741
3093,happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply,741
3094,like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible,741
3095,"beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but",741
3096,by which I have not been wounded.”,741
3097,"“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an",742
3098,"exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an",742
3099,extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is,742
3100,this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an,742
3101,"inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their",742
3102,"absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack",742
3103,of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an,742
3104,"impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes,",742
3105,"however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses",742
3106,"our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply",742
3107,appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are,742
3108,"no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are",742
3109,"both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle",742
3110,"enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?",742
3111,Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had,742
3112,such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the,742
3113,rest of my life. The people who have adored me—there have not been very,742
3114,"many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long",742
3115,"after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have",742
3116,"become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for",742
3117,reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is!,742
3118,And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb,742
3119,"the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details",742
3120,are always vulgar.”,742
3121,"“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian.",743
3122,"“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has always",744
3123,"poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once",744
3124,"wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic",744
3125,"mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did",744
3126,die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice,744
3127,the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one,744
3128,"with the terror of eternity. Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at",744
3129,"Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in",744
3130,"question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and",744
3131,"digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance",744
3132,in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again and assured me that I,744
3133,had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous,744
3134,"dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she",744
3135,showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women,744
3136,"never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act,",744
3137,"and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose",744
3138,"to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would",744
3139,"have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.",744
3140,"They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are",744
3141,"more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the",744
3142,women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.,744
3143,Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going,744
3144,"in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve,",744
3145,"whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of",744
3146,pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a,744
3147,great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their,744
3148,"husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it",744
3149,were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its,744
3150,"mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and",744
3151,"I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being",744
3152,told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes;,744
3153,there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern,744
3154,"life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”",744
3155,"“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly.",745
3156,"“Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when one",746
3157,loses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But,746
3158,"really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the",746
3159,women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her,746
3160,death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.,746
3161,"They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with,",746
3162,"such as romance, passion, and love.”",746
3163,“I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.”,747
3164,"“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more",748
3165,than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have,748
3166,"emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all",748
3167,the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I,748
3168,"have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how",748
3169,"delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day",748
3170,"before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful,",748
3171,"but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to",748
3172,everything.”,748
3173,"“What was that, Harry?”",749
3174,“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of,750
3175,"romance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that",750
3176,"if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”",750
3177,"“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying his",751
3178,face in his hands.,751
3179,"“No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you",752
3180,must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a,752
3181,"strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene",752
3182,"from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived,",752
3183,and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a,752
3184,"dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them",752
3185,"lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music",752
3186,sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual,752
3187,"life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn",752
3188,"for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was",752
3189,strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio,752
3190,died. But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less real,752
3191,than they are.”,752
3192,"There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and",753
3193,"with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours",753
3194,faded wearily out of things.,753
3195,After some time Dorian Gray looked up. “You have explained me to,754
3196,"myself, Harry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. “I felt",754
3197,"all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not",754
3198,express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again,754
3199,of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all.,754
3200,I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.”,754
3201,"“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that",755
3202,"you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”",755
3203,"“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What",756
3204,then?”,756
3205,"“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear Dorian, you",757
3206,"would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to",757
3207,"you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads",757
3208,"too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We",757
3209,cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the,757
3210,"club. We are rather late, as it is.”",757
3211,"“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat",758
3212,anything. What is the number of your sister’s box?”,758
3213,"“Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her",759
3214,name on the door. But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”,759
3215,"“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly. “But I am awfully",760
3216,obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my,760
3217,best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.”,760
3218,"“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered Lord",761
3219,"Henry, shaking him by the hand. “Good-bye. I shall see you before",761
3220,"nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.”",761
3221,"As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in",762
3222,a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.,762
3223,He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an,762
3224,interminable time over everything.,762
3225,"As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No;",763
3226,there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of,763
3227,Sibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious,763
3228,of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred,763
3229,"the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment",763
3230,"that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it",763
3231,indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed,763
3232,"within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the",763
3233,"change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.",763
3234,Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked,764
3235,death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her,764
3236,with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed,764
3237,"him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would",764
3238,always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything by the,764
3239,sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what,764
3240,"she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.",764
3241,"When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent",764
3242,on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A,764
3243,wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her,764
3244,"childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He",764
3245,brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.,764
3246,He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his,765
3247,"choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and",765
3248,"his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion,",765
3249,"pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have",765
3250,all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame:,765
3251,that was all.,765
3252,A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that,766
3253,"was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery",766
3254,"of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips",766
3255,that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat,766
3256,"before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as",766
3257,it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which,766
3258,"he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be",766
3259,"hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had",766
3260,so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The,766
3261,pity of it! the pity of it!,766
3262,"For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that",767
3263,existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in,767
3264,answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain,767
3265,"unchanged. And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender",767
3266,"the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance",767
3267,"might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?",767
3268,"Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer",767
3269,that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious,767
3270,scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence,767
3271,"upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon",767
3272,"dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire,",767
3273,might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods,767
3274,"and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?",767
3275,But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a,767
3276,"prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to",767
3277,alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?,767
3278,For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to,768
3279,follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him,768
3280,"the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so",768
3281,"it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he",768
3282,would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.,768
3283,"When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of",768
3284,"chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one",768
3285,blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life,768
3286,"would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and",768
3287,"fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured",768
3288,image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.,768
3289,"He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture,",769
3290,"smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was",769
3291,"already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord",769
3292,Henry was leaning over his chair.,769
3293,CHAPTER IX.,773
3294,"As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown",775
3295,into the room.,775
3296,"“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I called",776
3297,"last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew",776
3298,that was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really,776
3299,"gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy",776
3300,might be followed by another. I think you might have telegraphed for me,776
3301,when you heard of it first. I read of it quite by chance in a late,776
3302,edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club. I came here at,776
3303,once and was miserable at not finding you. I can’t tell you how,776
3304,heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer.,776
3305,But where were you? Did you go down and see the girl’s mother? For a,776
3306,moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the,776
3307,"paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it? But I was afraid of",776
3308,intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman! What a,776
3309,"state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about",776
3310,it all?”,776
3311,"“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some",777
3312,"pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass",777
3313,and looking dreadfully bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come,777
3314,"on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time. We",777
3315,were in her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.,777
3316,"Don’t talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it",777
3317,"has never happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives",777
3318,reality to things. I may mention that she was not the woman’s only,777
3319,"child. There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on",777
3320,"the stage. He is a sailor, or something. And now, tell me about",777
3321,yourself and what you are painting.”,777
3322,"“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a",778
3323,strained touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while Sibyl,778
3324,Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other,778
3325,"women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl",778
3326,"you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there",778
3327,are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”,778
3328,"“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet. “You",779
3329,must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is past is,779
3330,past.”,779
3331,“You call yesterday the past?”,780
3332,“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only,781
3333,shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is,781
3334,master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a,781
3335,pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use,781
3336,"them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”",781
3337,"“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You",782
3338,"look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come",782
3339,"down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural,",782
3340,and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the,782
3341,"whole world. Now, I don’t know what has come over you. You talk as if",782
3342,"you had no heart, no pity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see",782
3343,that.”,782
3344,"The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few",783
3345,"moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. “I owe a great",783
3346,"deal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you. You",783
3347,only taught me to be vain.”,783
3348,"“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”",784
3349,"“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round. “I",785
3350,don’t know what you want. What do you want?”,785
3351,"“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly.",786
3352,"“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his",787
3353,"shoulder, “you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl",787
3354,Vane had killed herself—”,787
3355,“Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried,788
3356,"Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.",788
3357,“My dear Basil! Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident? Of,789
3358,course she killed herself.”,789
3359,"The elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he muttered,",790
3360,and a shudder ran through him.,790
3361,"“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it. It is one",791
3362,"of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act",791
3363,"lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful",791
3364,"wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue",791
3365,and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her,791
3366,finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played—the,791
3367,night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of,791
3368,"love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.",791
3369,She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the,791
3370,martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of,791
3371,"martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not",791
3372,think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular,791
3373,"moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would",791
3374,"have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the",791
3375,"news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered",791
3376,"immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can,",791
3377,"except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come",791
3378,"down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled,",791
3379,and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a,791
3380,story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty,791
3381,"years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some",791
3382,"unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded,",791
3383,and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing,791
3384,"to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And",791
3385,"besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me",791
3386,"rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic",791
3387,point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la,791
3388,consolation des arts_? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered,791
3389,book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.,791
3390,"Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at",791
3391,"Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could",791
3392,console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that,791
3393,"one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work,",791
3394,"carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to",791
3395,"be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create,",791
3396,"or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of",791
3397,"one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I",791
3398,know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not,791
3399,realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am,791
3400,"a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am",791
3401,"different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must",791
3402,"always be my friend. Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know",791
3403,that you are better than he is. You are not stronger—you are too much,791
3404,afraid of life—but you are better. And how happy we used to be,791
3405,"together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I",791
3406,am. There is nothing more to be said.”,791
3407,"The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him,",792
3408,and his personality had been the great turning point in his art. He,792
3409,"could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more. After all, his",792
3410,indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away. There was,792
3411,"so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.",792
3412,"“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to",793
3413,"you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only trust your",793
3414,name won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is to take,793
3415,place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”,793
3416,"Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at",794
3417,the mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and,794
3418,"vulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my name,” he",794
3419,answered.,794
3420,“But surely she did?”,795
3421,"“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned",796
3422,to any one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn,796
3423,"who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince",796
3424,"Charming. It was pretty of her. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl,",796
3425,Basil. I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a,796
3426,few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”,796
3427,"“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you",797
3428,must come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without you.”,797
3429,"“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he exclaimed,",798
3430,starting back.,798
3431,"The painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried. “Do",799
3432,you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have,799
3433,you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the best,799
3434,"thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply",799
3435,disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room,799
3436,looked different as I came in.”,799
3437,"“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I let",800
3438,him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that,800
3439,is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.”,800
3440,"“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for",801
3441,it. Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.,801
3442,"A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between",802
3443,"the painter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you",802
3444,must not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”,802
3445,“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look at,803
3446,"it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.",803
3447,"“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never",804
3448,speak to you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer,804
3449,"any explanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you",804
3450,"touch this screen, everything is over between us.”",804
3451,Hallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute,805
3452,amazement. He had never seen him like this before. The lad was actually,805
3453,"pallid with rage. His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes",805
3454,were like disks of blue fire. He was trembling all over.,805
3455,“Dorian!”,806
3456,“Don’t speak!”,807
3457,“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want,808
3458,"me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over",808
3459,"towards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that I",808
3460,"shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in",808
3461,Paris in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of,808
3462,"varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”",808
3463,"“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a",809
3464,strange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be,809
3465,shown his secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That,809
3466,was impossible. Something—he did not know what—had to be done at once.,809
3467,“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is going,810
3468,to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de,810
3469,"Sèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only",810
3470,be away a month. I should think you could easily spare it for that,810
3471,"time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town. And if you keep it",810
3472,"always behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”",810
3473,Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of,811
3474,perspiration there. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible,811
3475,"danger. “You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he",811
3476,cried. “Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being,811
3477,consistent have just as many moods as others have. The only difference,811
3478,is that your moods are rather meaningless. You can’t have forgotten,811
3479,that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would,811
3480,induce you to send it to any exhibition. You told Harry exactly the,811
3481,"same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his",811
3482,"eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half",811
3483,"seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of",811
3484,"an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He",811
3485,"told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps",811
3486,"Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.",811
3487,"“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in",812
3488,"the face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall",812
3489,tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my,812
3490,picture?”,812
3491,"The painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you",813
3492,"might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I",813
3493,could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me,813
3494,"never to look at your picture again, I am content. I have always you to",813
3495,look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from,813
3496,"the world, I am satisfied. Your friendship is dearer to me than any",813
3497,fame or reputation.”,813
3498,"“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think I have a",814
3499,"right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity",814
3500,had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s,814
3501,mystery.,814
3502,"“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled. “Let us",815
3503,sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in the,815
3504,picture something curious?—something that probably at first did not,815
3505,"strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”",815
3506,"“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling",816
3507,hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.,816
3508,“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.,817
3509,"Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most",817
3510,"extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and",817
3511,"power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen",817
3512,ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I,817
3513,worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted,817
3514,to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When,817
3515,"you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course,",817
3516,I never let you know anything about this. It would have been,817
3517,impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it,817
3518,"myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that",817
3519,"the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for",817
3520,"in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less",817
3521,"than the peril of keeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew",817
3522,more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn,817
3523,"you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and",817
3524,polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on,817
3525,"the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You",817
3526,had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the,817
3527,water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face. And it had all been,817
3528,"what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day",817
3529,"I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as",817
3530,"you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own",817
3531,"dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the method,",817
3532,"or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to",817
3533,"me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at",817
3534,"it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I",817
3535,"grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that",817
3536,"I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it",817
3537,was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You,817
3538,were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant,817
3539,"to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not",817
3540,"mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I",817
3541,"felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my",817
3542,"studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of",817
3543,"its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that",817
3544,"I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely",817
3545,good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling,817
3546,that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is,817
3547,ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract,817
3548,than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.,817
3549,It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely,817
3550,"than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris, I",817
3551,determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.,817
3552,It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were,817
3553,"right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me,",817
3554,"Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are",817
3555,made to be worshipped.”,817
3556,"Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and",818
3557,a smile played about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the,818
3558,time. Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who,818
3559,"had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he",818
3560,himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend. Lord,818
3561,Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all. He was,818
3562,too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be,818
3563,some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry? Was that one of,818
3564,the things that life had in store?,818
3565,"“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should",819
3566,have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”,819
3567,"“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very",820
3568,curious.”,820
3569,"“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”",821
3570,"Dorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not",822
3571,possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”,822
3572,"“You will some day, surely?”",823
3573,“Never.”,824
3574,"“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been",825
3575,the one person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I,825
3576,"have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost",825
3577,me to tell you all that I have told you.”,825
3578,"“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply that you",826
3579,felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a compliment.”,826
3580,“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I,827
3581,"have made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one",827
3582,should never put one’s worship into words.”,827
3583,“It was a very disappointing confession.”,828
3584,"“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in the",829
3585,"picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”",829
3586,“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t,830
3587,"talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we",830
3588,must always remain so.”,830
3589,"“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.",831
3590,"“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry spends",832
3591,his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is,832
3592,improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I,832
3593,don’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go,832
3594,"to you, Basil.”",832
3595,“You will sit to me again?”,833
3596,“Impossible!”,834
3597,"“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes",835
3598,across two ideal things. Few come across one.”,835
3599,"“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.",836
3600,There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I,836
3601,will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”,836
3602,"“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully. “And",837
3603,now good-bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once,837
3604,again. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel about,837
3605,it.”,837
3606,"As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How",838
3607,"little he knew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead",838
3608,"of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded,",838
3609,"almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend! How much that",838
3610,strange confession explained to him! The painter’s absurd fits of,838
3611,"jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious",838
3612,"reticences—he understood them all now, and he felt sorry. There seemed",838
3613,to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.,838
3614,He sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all,839
3615,costs. He could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad,839
3616,"of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room",839
3617,to which any of his friends had access.,839
3618,CHAPTER X.,843
3619,"When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if",845
3620,he had thought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite,845
3621,impassive and waited for his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked,845
3622,over to the glass and glanced into it. He could see the reflection of,845
3623,Victor’s face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There,845
3624,"was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet he thought it best to be on his",845
3625,guard.,845
3626,"Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he",846
3627,"wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to",846
3628,send two of his men round at once. It seemed to him that as the man,846
3629,left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen. Or was,846
3630,that merely his own fancy?,846
3631,"After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread",847
3632,"mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He",847
3633,asked her for the key of the schoolroom.,847
3634,"“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is full of",848
3635,dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It,848
3636,"is not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”",848
3637,"“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”",849
3638,"“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why, it",850
3639,hasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”,850
3640,He winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of,851
3641,"him. “That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see the",851
3642,place—that is all. Give me the key.”,851
3643,"“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents",852
3644,of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key. I’ll,852
3645,have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of living up,852
3646,"there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”",852
3647,"“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will do.”",853
3648,"She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of",854
3649,the household. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought,854
3650,"best. She left the room, wreathed in smiles.",854
3651,"As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round",855
3652,"the room. His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily",855
3653,"embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century",855
3654,Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.,855
3655,"Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps",855
3656,served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to hide something that,855
3657,"had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death",855
3658,itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die. What,855
3659,"the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on",855
3660,the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They,855
3661,would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still,855
3662,live on. It would be always alive.,855
3663,"He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil",856
3664,the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would,856
3665,"have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more",856
3666,poisonous influences that came from his own temperament. The love that,856
3667,he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble,856
3668,and intellectual. It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty,856
3669,that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire. It was,856
3670,"such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann,",856
3671,"and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have saved him. But it was",856
3672,"too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or",856
3673,forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable. There were,856
3674,"passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that",856
3675,would make the shadow of their evil real.,856
3676,He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that,857
3677,"covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was",857
3678,the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was,857
3679,"unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue",857
3680,"eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there. It was simply the",857
3681,expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty. Compared,857
3682,"to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s",857
3683,"reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how shallow, and of what little",857
3684,account! His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and,857
3685,"calling him to judgement. A look of pain came across him, and he flung",857
3686,"the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock came to the door.",857
3687,He passed out as his servant entered.,857
3688,"“The persons are here, Monsieur.”",858
3689,He felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed,859
3690,to know where the picture was being taken to. There was something sly,859
3691,"about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the",859
3692,"writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him",859
3693,round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at,859
3694,eight-fifteen that evening.,859
3695,"“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in",860
3696,here.”,860
3697,"In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard",861
3698,"himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in",861
3699,with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a,861
3700,"florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was",861
3701,considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the,861
3702,"artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never left his shop. He",861
3703,waited for people to come to him. But he always made an exception in,861
3704,favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed,861
3705,everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.,861
3706,"“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled",862
3707,hands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in,862
3708,"person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a",862
3709,"sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited",862
3710,"for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”",862
3711,"“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.",863
3712,Hubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t,863
3713,go in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only want a,863
3714,"picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so",863
3715,I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”,863
3716,"“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to",864
3717,"you. Which is the work of art, sir?”",864
3718,"“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move it,",865
3719,"covering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched going",865
3720,upstairs.”,865
3721,"“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,",866
3722,"beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from",866
3723,"the long brass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall",866
3724,"we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”",866
3725,"“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or",867
3726,perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top,867
3727,"of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”",867
3728,"He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and",868
3729,began the ascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the,868
3730,"picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious",868
3731,"protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike",868
3732,"of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it",868
3733,so as to help them.,868
3734,"“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they",869
3735,reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.,869
3736,"“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the",870
3737,door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious,870
3738,secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.,870
3739,"He had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed,",871
3740,"since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then",871
3741,"as a study when he grew somewhat older. It was a large,",871
3742,"well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord",871
3743,"Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness",871
3744,"to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and",871
3745,desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to have but little,871
3746,"changed. There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically",871
3747,"painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so",871
3748,often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled,871
3749,with his dog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the,871
3750,same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing,871
3751,"chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded",871
3752,birds on their gauntleted wrists. How well he remembered it all! Every,871
3753,moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round. He,871
3754,"recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed",871
3755,horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden,871
3756,"away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in",871
3757,store for him!,871
3758,But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as,872
3759,"this. He had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its",872
3760,"purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden,",872
3761,and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it. He himself would,872
3762,not see it. Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul? He,872
3763,"kept his youth—that was enough. And, besides, might not his nature grow",872
3764,"finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full",872
3765,"of shame. Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and",872
3766,shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit,872
3767,and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them,872
3768,"their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would",872
3769,"have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to",872
3770,the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.,872
3771,"No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon",873
3772,"the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but",873
3773,the hideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become,873
3774,hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes,873
3775,"and make them horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth",873
3776,"would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old",873
3777,"men are. There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined",873
3778,"hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had",873
3779,been so stern to him in his boyhood. The picture had to be concealed.,873
3780,There was no help for it.,873
3781,"“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round. “I",874
3782,am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something else.”,874
3783,"“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who",875
3784,"was still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”",875
3785,"“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.",876
3786,Just lean it against the wall. Thanks.”,876
3787,"“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”",877
3788,"Dorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,",878
3789,keeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling,878
3790,him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that,878
3791,concealed the secret of his life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I,878
3792,am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”,878
3793,"“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,",879
3794,"sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant,",879
3795,who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough,879
3796,uncomely face. He had never seen any one so marvellous.,879
3797,"When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door",880
3798,and put the key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look,880
3799,upon the horrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.,880
3800,"On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock",881
3801,and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark,881
3802,"perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley,",881
3803,"his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the",881
3804,"preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside",881
3805,"it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the",881
3806,edges soiled. A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_,881
3807,had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had,881
3808,returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were,881
3809,leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.,881
3810,"He would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already,",881
3811,while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set,881
3812,"back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he",881
3813,might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the,881
3814,room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house. He had,881
3815,heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some,881
3816,"servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked",881
3817,"up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower",881
3818,or a shred of crumpled lace.,881
3819,"He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s",882
3820,"note. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper,",882
3821,"and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at",882
3822,"eight-fifteen. He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked",882
3823,through it. A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew,882
3824,attention to the following paragraph:,882
3825,INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.—An inquest was held this morning at the Bell,883
3826,"Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of",883
3827,"Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre,",883
3828,Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned. Considerable,883
3829,"sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly",883
3830,"affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.",883
3831,"Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.",883
3832,"He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and",885
3833,flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real,885
3834,ugliness made things! He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for,885
3835,having sent him the report. And it was certainly stupid of him to have,885
3836,marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more,885
3837,than enough English for that.,885
3838,"Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet,",886
3839,what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?,886
3840,There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.,886
3841,His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was,887
3842,"it, he wondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal",887
3843,stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange,887
3844,"Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung",887
3845,himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves. After a,887
3846,few minutes he became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he had,887
3847,"ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the",887
3848,"delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb",887
3849,show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made,887
3850,real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually,887
3851,revealed.,887
3852,"It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being,",888
3853,"indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who",888
3854,spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the,888
3855,passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his,888
3856,"own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through",888
3857,"which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere",888
3858,"artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue,",888
3859,as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin. The,888
3860,"style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid",888
3861,"and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical",888
3862,"expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work",888
3863,of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.,888
3864,There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in,888
3865,colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical,888
3866,philosophy. One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the,888
3867,spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of,888
3868,a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense,888
3869,seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain. The mere,888
3870,"cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full",888
3871,"as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,",888
3872,"produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter,",888
3873,"a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of",888
3874,the falling day and creeping shadows.,888
3875,"Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed",889
3876,through the windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no,889
3877,"more. Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the",889
3878,"lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed",889
3879,the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his,889
3880,bedside and began to dress for dinner.,889
3881,"It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found",890
3882,"Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.",890
3883,"“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your",891
3884,fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the,891
3885,time was going.”,891
3886,"“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his",892
3887,chair.,892
3888,"“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is a",893
3889,great difference.”,893
3890,"“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they passed",894
3891,into the dining-room.,894
3892,CHAPTER XI.,898
3893,"For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of",900
3894,this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never,900
3895,sought to free himself from it. He procured from Paris no less than,900
3896,"nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in",900
3897,"different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the",900
3898,"changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have",900
3899,"almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in",900
3900,whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely,900
3901,"blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,",900
3902,"indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own",900
3903,"life, written before he had lived it.",900
3904,In one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He,901
3905,"never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque",901
3906,"dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which",901
3907,"came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned",901
3908,"by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so",901
3909,remarkable. It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every,901
3910,"joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used",901
3911,"to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if",901
3912,"somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who",901
3913,"had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly",901
3914,valued.,901
3915,"For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and",902
3916,"many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had",902
3917,heard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange,902
3918,rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the,902
3919,chatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when,902
3920,they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself,902
3921,unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when,902
3922,Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his,902
3923,face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the,902
3924,memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one,902
3925,so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an,902
3926,age that was at once sordid and sensual.,902
3927,"Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged",903
3928,absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were,903
3929,"his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep",903
3930,"upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left",903
3931,"him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil",903
3932,"Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on",903
3933,"the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him",903
3934,from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to,903
3935,quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his,903
3936,"own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.",903
3937,"He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and",903
3938,"terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead",903
3939,"or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which",903
3940,"were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would",903
3941,"place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture,",903
3942,and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.,903
3943,"There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own",904
3944,"delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little",904
3945,"ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in",904
3946,"disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he",904
3947,had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant,904
3948,because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare.,904
3949,"That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as",904
3950,"they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase",904
3951,"with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He",904
3952,had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.,904
3953,"Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to",905
3954,"society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each",905
3955,"Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the",905
3956,world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the,905
3957,day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little,905
3958,"dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were",905
3959,"noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited,",905
3960,"as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with",905
3961,"its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered",905
3962,"cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many,",905
3963,"especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw,",905
3964,in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often,905
3965,"dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of",905
3966,the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and,905
3967,perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of,905
3968,the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make,905
3969,"themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one",905
3970,for whom “the visible world existed.”,905
3971,"And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the",906
3972,"arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.",906
3973,"Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment",906
3974,"universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert",906
3975,"the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for",906
3976,"him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to",906
3977,"time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of",906
3978,"the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in",906
3979,"everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of",906
3980,"his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.",906
3981,"For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost",907
3982,"immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a",907
3983,subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the,907
3984,London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the,907
3985,"Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be",907
3986,"something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on",907
3987,"the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of",907
3988,a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have,907
3989,"its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the",907
3990,spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.,907
3991,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been",908
3992,"decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and",908
3993,"sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are",908
3994,conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.,908
3995,But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had,908
3996,"never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal",908
3997,merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or,908
3998,"to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a",908
3999,"new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the",908
4000,dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through,908
4001,"history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been",908
4002,surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful,908
4003,"rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose",908
4004,origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more,908
4005,"terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance,",908
4006,"they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out",908
4007,the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to,908
4008,the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.,908
4009,"Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that",909
4010,was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism,909
4011,"that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its",909
4012,"service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any",909
4013,theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of,909
4014,"passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself,",909
4015,"and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of",909
4016,"the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy",909
4017,"that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to",909
4018,concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a,909
4019,moment.,909
4020,"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either",910
4021,after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of,910
4022,"death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through",910
4023,the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality,910
4024,"itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques,",910
4025,"and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one",910
4026,"might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled",910
4027,with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the,910
4028,"curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb",910
4029,"shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there. Outside,",910
4030,"there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men",910
4031,"going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down",910
4032,"from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it",910
4033,feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from,910
4034,"her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by",910
4035,"degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we",910
4036,watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan,910
4037,mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we,910
4038,"had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been",910
4039,"studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the",910
4040,"letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.",910
4041,Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night,910
4042,comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where,910
4043,"we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the",910
4044,necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of,910
4045,"stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids",910
4046,might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in,910
4047,"the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh",910
4048,"shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in",910
4049,"which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate,",910
4050,"in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of",910
4051,joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.,910
4052,It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray,911
4053,"to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his",911
4054,"search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and",911
4055,"possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he",911
4056,would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really,911
4057,"alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and",911
4058,"then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his",911
4059,"intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that",911
4060,"is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that,",911
4061,"indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition",911
4062,of it.,911
4063,It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman,912
4064,"Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great",912
4065,"attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the",912
4066,"sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb",912
4067,rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity,912
4068,of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it,912
4069,sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement,912
4070,"and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with",912
4071,"white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft",912
4072,"the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at",912
4073,"times, one would fain think, is indeed the “_panis cælestis_,” the",912
4074,"bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ,",912
4075,breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.,912
4076,"The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet,",912
4077,tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle,912
4078,"fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at",912
4079,the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of,912
4080,them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating,912
4081,the true story of their lives.,912
4082,But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual,913
4083,"development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of",913
4084,"mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable",913
4085,"for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which",913
4086,"there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its",913
4087,"marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle",913
4088,"antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a",913
4089,season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of,913
4090,"the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in",913
4091,tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the,913
4092,"brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of",913
4093,"the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions,",913
4094,"morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him",913
4095,"before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance",913
4096,compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all,913
4097,intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.,913
4098,"He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual",913
4099,mysteries to reveal.,913
4100,And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their,914
4101,"manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums",914
4102,from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not,914
4103,"its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their",914
4104,"true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one",914
4105,"mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets",914
4106,"that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the",914
4107,"brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often",914
4108,"to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several",914
4109,"influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers;",914
4110,"of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that",914
4111,"sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to",914
4112,be able to expel melancholy from the soul.,914
4113,"At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long",915
4114,"latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of",915
4115,"olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad",915
4116,"gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled",915
4117,"Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while",915
4118,"grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching",915
4119,"upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of",915
4120,reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and,915
4121,horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of,915
4122,"barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s",915
4123,"beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell",915
4124,unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the world,915
4125,"the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of",915
4126,dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact,915
4127,"with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the",915
4128,"mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not",915
4129,allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been,915
4130,"subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the",915
4131,"Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human",915
4132,"bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green",915
4133,jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular,915
4134,sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when,915
4135,"they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the",915
4136,"performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the",915
4137,"harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who",915
4138,"sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a",915
4139,"distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating",915
4140,tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an,915
4141,elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells,915
4142,"of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge",915
4143,"cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the",915
4144,one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican,915
4145,"temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a",915
4146,description. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated,915
4147,"him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like",915
4148,"Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous",915
4149,"voices. Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his",915
4150,"box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt",915
4151,pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work,915
4152,of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.,915
4153,"On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a",916
4154,"costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered",916
4155,with five hundred and sixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for,916
4156,"years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him. He would often",916
4157,spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various,916
4158,"stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that",916
4159,"turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver,",916
4160,"the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes,",916
4161,"carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red",916
4162,"cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their",916
4163,alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the,916
4164,"sunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow",916
4165,of the milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of,916
4166,"extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la",916
4167,vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.,916
4168,"He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s",917
4169,Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real,917
4170,"jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of",917
4171,Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes “with,917
4172,collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in,917
4173,"the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition",917
4174,of golden letters and a scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into,917
4175,"a magical sleep and slain. According to the great alchemist, Pierre de",917
4176,"Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India",917
4177,"made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth",917
4178,"provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The",917
4179,"garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her",917
4180,"colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus,",917
4181,"that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.",917
4182,Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a,917
4183,"newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison. The",917
4184,"bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm",917
4185,that could cure the plague. In the nests of Arabian birds was the,917
4186,"aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any",917
4187,danger by fire.,917
4188,"The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand,",918
4189,as the ceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the,918
4190,"Priest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake",918
4191,"inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.” Over the gable",918
4192,"were “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the",918
4193,gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange,918
4194,"romance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of",918
4195,"the queen one could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world,",918
4196,"inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites,",918
4197,"carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the",918
4198,inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the,918
4199,dead. A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver,918
4200,"brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven",918
4201,"moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the king into the great pit,",918
4202,"he flung it away—Procopius tells the story—nor was it ever found again,",918
4203,though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold,918
4204,pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a,918
4205,"rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he",918
4206,worshipped.,918
4207,"When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII.",919
4208,"of France, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to",919
4209,"Brantome, and his cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great",919
4210,light. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred,919
4211,"and twenty-one diamonds. Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty",919
4212,"thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. Hall described",919
4213,"Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his coronation, as",919
4214,"wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds",919
4215,"and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of large",919
4216,balasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in,919
4217,gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold,919
4218,"armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with",919
4219,"turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap _parsemé_ with pearls. Henry II. wore",919
4220,"jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with",919
4221,twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients. The ducal hat of Charles the,919
4222,"Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his race, was hung with pear-shaped",919
4223,pearls and studded with sapphires.,919
4224,How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and,920
4225,decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.,920
4226,Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that,921
4227,performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern,921
4228,nations of Europe. As he investigated the subject—and he always had an,921
4229,extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in,921
4230,whatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the,921
4231,"ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any",921
4232,"rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils",921
4233,"bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of",921
4234,"their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained",921
4235,his flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things! Where,921
4236,"had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which",921
4237,"the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls",921
4238,for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium that Nero had,921
4239,"stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on",921
4240,"which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot",921
4241,"drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious",921
4242,"table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were",921
4243,displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast;,921
4244,"the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden",921
4245,bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of,921
4246,"Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests,",921
4247,"rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and",921
4248,"the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which",921
4249,"were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “_Madame, je suis tout",921
4250,"joyeux_,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold",921
4251,"thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four",921
4252,pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims,921
4253,for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen,921
4254,"hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the",921
4255,"king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings",921
4256,"were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked",921
4257,in gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black,921
4258,"velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask,",921
4259,"with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground,",921
4260,"and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in",921
4261,a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon,921
4262,cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen,921
4263,"feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland,",921
4264,was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses,921
4265,"from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased,",921
4266,and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been,921
4267,"taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed",921
4268,had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.,921
4269,"And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite",922
4270,"specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting",922
4271,"the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and",922
4272,"stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that",922
4273,"from their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,” and",922
4274,"“running water,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java;",922
4275,elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair,922
4276,"blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of",922
4277,_lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish,922
4278,"velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_,",922
4279,with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.,922
4280,"He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed",923
4281,he had for everything connected with the service of the Church. In the,923
4282,"long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had",923
4283,stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the,923
4284,"raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and",923
4285,fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by,923
4286,the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain. He,923
4287,"possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask,",923
4288,figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in,923
4289,"six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the",923
4290,pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided,923
4291,"into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the",923
4292,coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.,923
4293,This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. Another cope was of,923
4294,"green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves,",923
4295,"from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which",923
4296,were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals. The morse,923
4297,bore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work. The orphreys were,923
4298,"woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with",923
4299,"medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He",923
4300,"had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold",923
4301,"brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with",923
4302,"representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and",923
4303,embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of,923
4304,"white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins",923
4305,and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen;,923
4306,"and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic offices",923
4307,"to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his",923
4308,imagination.,923
4309,"For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely",924
4310,"house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he",924
4311,"could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times",924
4312,to be almost too great to be borne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked,924
4313,"room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his",924
4314,own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the,924
4315,"real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the",924
4316,"purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go there,",924
4317,"would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,",924
4318,"his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.",924
4319,"Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to",924
4320,"dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day,",924
4321,until he was driven away. On his return he would sit in front of the,924
4322,"picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times,",924
4323,"with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin,",924
4324,and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to,924
4325,bear the burden that should have been his own.,924
4326,"After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and",925
4327,"gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as",925
4328,well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more,925
4329,than once spent the winter. He hated to be separated from the picture,925
4330,"that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his",925
4331,"absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the",925
4332,elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.,925
4333,He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true,926
4334,"that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness",926
4335,"of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn",926
4336,from that? He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him. He had not,926
4337,painted it. What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?,926
4338,"Even if he told them, would they believe it?",926
4339,Yet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in,927
4340,"Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank",927
4341,"who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton",927
4342,"luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly",927
4343,leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not,927
4344,been tampered with and that the picture was still there. What if it,927
4345,should be stolen? The mere thought made him cold with horror. Surely,927
4346,the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the world already,927
4347,suspected it.,927
4348,"For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.",928
4349,He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth,928
4350,"and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was",928
4351,"said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the",928
4352,"smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another",928
4353,gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. Curious stories,928
4354,became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year. It,928
4355,was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a,928
4356,"low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with",928
4357,thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His,928
4358,"extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear",928
4359,"again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass",928
4360,"him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though",928
4361,they were determined to discover his secret.,928
4362,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice,",929
4363,"and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his",929
4364,"charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth",929
4365,"that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer",929
4366,"to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about",929
4367,"him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most",929
4368,"intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had",929
4369,"wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and",929
4370,"set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or",929
4371,horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.,929
4372,Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his,930
4373,strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of,930
4374,"security. Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to",930
4375,believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and,930
4376,fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance,930
4377,"than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much",930
4378,"less value than the possession of a good _chef_. And, after all, it is",930
4379,a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad,930
4380,"dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the",930
4381,"cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry",930
4382,"remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a",930
4383,"good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are,",930
4384,"or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely",930
4385,"essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as",930
4386,"its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic",930
4387,play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is,930
4388,insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method,930
4389,by which we can multiply our personalities.,930
4390,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the",931
4391,shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing,931
4392,"simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a",931
4393,"being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform",931
4394,creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and,931
4395,"passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies",931
4396,of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery,931
4397,of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose,931
4398,"blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert, described by",931
4399,"Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and",931
4400,"King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome",931
4401,"face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life",931
4402,that he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body,931
4403,to body till it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that,931
4404,"ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause,",931
4405,"give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had",931
4406,"so changed his life? Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled",931
4407,"surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard,",931
4408,with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet. What had this man’s,931
4409,legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some,931
4410,inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own actions merely the dreams,931
4411,"that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading",931
4412,"canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl",931
4413,"stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand,",931
4414,and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On,931
4415,a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green,931
4416,"rosettes upon her little pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the",931
4417,strange stories that were told about her lovers. Had he something of,931
4418,"her temperament in him? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look",931
4419,"curiously at him. What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and",931
4420,fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was saturnine and,931
4421,"swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.",931
4422,Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so,931
4423,"overladen with rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century,",931
4424,"and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord",931
4425,"Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and",931
4426,one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How,931
4427,"proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!",931
4428,What passions had he bequeathed? The world had looked upon him as,931
4429,infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The star of the,931
4430,Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of his,931
4431,"wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred",931
4432,within him. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady,931
4433,"Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got",931
4434,"from her. He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the",931
4435,beauty of others. She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.,931
4436,There were vine leaves in her hair. The purple spilled from the cup she,931
4437,"was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes",931
4438,were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour. They,931
4439,seemed to follow him wherever he went.,931
4440,"Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race,",932
4441,"nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly",932
4442,with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious. There,932
4443,were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history,932
4444,"was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act",932
4445,"and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it",932
4446,had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt that he had known,932
4447,"them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the",932
4448,stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of,932
4449,subtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had,932
4450,been his own.,932
4451,The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had,933
4452,"himself known this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how,",933
4453,"crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as",933
4454,"Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of",933
4455,"Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the",933
4456,"flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had",933
4457,caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in,933
4458,"an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had",933
4459,"wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round",933
4460,with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his,933
4461,"days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes",933
4462,on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear,933
4463,"emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of",933
4464,"pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the",933
4465,Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero,933
4466,"Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with",933
4467,"colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon",933
4468,from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.,933
4469,"Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the",934
4470,"two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious",934
4471,"tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and",934
4472,beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made,934
4473,"monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted",934
4474,her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the,934
4475,"dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the",934
4476,"Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and",934
4477,"whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the",934
4478,"price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase",934
4479,living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot,934
4480,"who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide",934
4481,riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto;,934
4482,"Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and",934
4483,"minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery,",934
4484,and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson,934
4485,"silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might",934
4486,"serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy",934
4487,"could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion",934
4488,"for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as",934
4489,"was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling",934
4490,"with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the",934
4491,name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads,934
4492,"was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of",934
4493,"Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the",934
4494,"enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave",934
4495,"poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a",934
4496,shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles,934
4497,"VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had",934
4498,"warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his",934
4499,"brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen",934
4500,"cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in",934
4501,"his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto",934
4502,"Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page,",934
4503,"and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow",934
4504,"piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep,",934
4505,"and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.",934
4506,"There was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and",935
4507,they troubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of,935
4508,"strange manners of poisoning—poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch,",935
4509,"by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by",935
4510,an amber chain. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book. There were,935
4511,moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could,935
4512,realize his conception of the beautiful.,935
4513,CHAPTER XII.,939
4514,"It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth",941
4515,"birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.",941
4516,"He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he",942
4517,"had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold",942
4518,"and foggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a",942
4519,"man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of",942
4520,his grey ulster turned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized,942
4521,"him. It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could",942
4522,"not account, came over him. He made no sign of recognition and went on",942
4523,quickly in the direction of his own house.,942
4524,But Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the,943
4525,"pavement and then hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on",943
4526,his arm.,943
4527,“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for,944
4528,you in your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on,944
4529,"your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am",944
4530,"off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see",944
4531,"you before I left. I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as",944
4532,you passed me. But I wasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”,944
4533,"“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor",945
4534,"Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at",945
4535,"all certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen",945
4536,you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”,945
4537,“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a,946
4538,studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture,946
4539,"I have in my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.",946
4540,Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something,946
4541,to say to you.”,946
4542,“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray,947
4543,languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his,947
4544,latch-key.,947
4545,"The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his",948
4546,"watch. “I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t go till",948
4547,"twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to",948
4548,"the club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any",948
4549,"delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with",948
4550,"me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”",948
4551,Dorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter,949
4552,"to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get",949
4553,into the house. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing,949
4554,is serious nowadays. At least nothing should be.”,949
4555,"Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the",950
4556,library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.,950
4557,"The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with",950
4558,"some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little",950
4559,marqueterie table.,950
4560,"“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me",951
4561,"everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is",951
4562,a most hospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman,951
4563,"you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”",951
4564,Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s,952
4565,"maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.",952
4566,"_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly",952
4567,"of the French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was not at all a bad",952
4568,"servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One",952
4569,often imagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted,952
4570,to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another,952
4571,brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take,952
4572,hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.”,952
4573,"“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap",953
4574,and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the,953
4575,"corner. “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.",953
4576,Don’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”,953
4577,"“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging",954
4578,himself down on the sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of,954
4579,myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.”,954
4580,"“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and",955
4581,I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”,955
4582,Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.,956
4583,"“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own",957
4584,sake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the,957
4585,most dreadful things are being said against you in London.”,957
4586,“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other,958
4587,"people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not got",958
4588,the charm of novelty.”,958
4589,"“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his",959
4590,good name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and,959
4591,"degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all",959
4592,that kind of thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind,959
4593,"you, I don’t believe these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe",959
4594,them when I see you. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s,959
4595,face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.,959
4596,"There are no such things. If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself",959
4597,"in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of",959
4598,"his hands even. Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but you know",959
4599,him—came to me last year to have his portrait done. I had never seen,959
4600,"him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though",959
4601,I have heard a good deal since. He offered an extravagant price. I,959
4602,refused him. There was something in the shape of his fingers that I,959
4603,hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.,959
4604,"His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent",959
4605,"face, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything",959
4606,"against you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to",959
4607,"the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these",959
4608,"hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what",959
4609,"to say. Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves",959
4610,the room of a club when you enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen,959
4611,in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs? You,959
4612,used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him at dinner last week.,959
4613,"Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the",959
4614,miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley. Staveley,959
4615,"curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,",959
4616,but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to,959
4617,"know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I",959
4618,"reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.",959
4619,He told me. He told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why,959
4620,is your friendship so fatal to young men? There was that wretched boy,959
4621,in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his great friend. There,959
4622,"was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.",959
4623,You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his,959
4624,dreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I met his,959
4625,father yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with shame and,959
4626,sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he,959
4627,got now? What gentleman would associate with him?”,959
4628,"“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know nothing,”",960
4629,"said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt",960
4630,in his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it. It,960
4631,"is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows",960
4632,"anything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could",960
4633,his record be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did,960
4634,"I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s",960
4635,"silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me? If",960
4636,"Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his",960
4637,keeper? I know how people chatter in England. The middle classes air,960
4638,"their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper",960
4639,about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try,960
4640,and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with,960
4641,"the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for a man to",960
4642,have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.,960
4643,"And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead",960
4644,"themselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land",960
4645,of the hypocrite.”,960
4646,"“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England is bad",961
4647,"enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why",961
4648,I want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge,961
4649,of a man by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all,961
4650,"sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a",961
4651,madness for pleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them,961
4652,"there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are",961
4653,smiling now. And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are,961
4654,"inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not",961
4655,have made his sister’s name a by-word.”,961
4656,"“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”",962
4657,"“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady",963
4658,"Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a",963
4659,single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?,963
4660,"Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her. Then there are",963
4661,other stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of,963
4662,dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in,963
4663,"London. Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I",963
4664,"laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder. What about your",963
4665,"country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don’t know",963
4666,what is said about you. I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to,963
4667,you. I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself,963
4668,"into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and",963
4669,then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to you. I want,963
4670,you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you,963
4671,to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the,963
4672,dreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like,963
4673,that. Don’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it,963
4674,"be for good, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with",963
4675,"whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to",963
4676,enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after. I don’t know,963
4677,whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am,963
4678,told things that it seems impossible to doubt. Lord Gloucester was one,963
4679,of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed me a letter that his wife,963
4680,had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.,963
4681,Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read. I,963
4682,"told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly, and that you",963
4683,were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know,963
4684,"you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”",963
4685,"“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and",964
4686,turning almost white from fear.,964
4687,"“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his",965
4688,"voice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”",965
4689,A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You,966
4690,"shall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the",966
4691,table. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at it?,966
4692,"You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody",966
4693,"would believe you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the",966
4694,"better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate",966
4695,"about it so tediously. Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough",966
4696,about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face.”,966
4697,There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his,967
4698,foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible,967
4699,"joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that",967
4700,the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his,967
4701,shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous,967
4702,memory of what he had done.,967
4703,"“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into",968
4704,"his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing that",968
4705,you fancy only God can see.”,968
4706,"Hallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried. “You must",969
4707,"not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don’t mean",969
4708,anything.”,969
4709,“You think so?” He laughed again.,970
4710,"“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your",971
4711,good. You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”,971
4712,“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”,972
4713,A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a,973
4714,"moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right",973
4715,had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of,973
4716,"what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he",973
4717,"straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood",973
4718,"there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their",973
4719,throbbing cores of flame.,973
4720,"“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.",974
4721,"He turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You must give",975
4722,me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If,975
4723,"you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I",975
4724,"shall believe you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I",975
4725,"am going through? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt,",975
4726,and shameful.”,975
4727,Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come,976
4728,"upstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from day",976
4729,"to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall",976
4730,show it to you if you come with me.”,976
4731,"“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my",977
4732,train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don’t ask me to,977
4733,read anything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.”,977
4734,“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You,978
4735,will not have to read long.”,978
4736,CHAPTER XIII.,982
4737,"He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward",984
4738,"following close behind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at",984
4739,night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A,984
4740,rising wind made some of the windows rattle.,984
4741,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the",985
4742,"floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on",985
4743,"knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice.",985
4744,“Yes.”,986
4745,"“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat",987
4746,"harshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know",987
4747,everything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you,987
4748,"think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold",987
4749,"current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a",987
4750,"flame of murky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he",987
4751,"whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.",987
4752,Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked,988
4753,"as if it had not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a",988
4754,"curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty",988
4755,"book-case—that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a",988
4756,table. As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was,988
4757,"standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered",988
4758,with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse ran scuffling,988
4759,behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.,988
4760,"“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that",989
4761,"curtain back, and you will see mine.”",989
4762,"The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or",990
4763,"playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.",990
4764,"“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore",991
4765,the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.,991
4766,An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the,992
4767,dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was,992
4768,something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.,992
4769,Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The,992
4770,"horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous",992
4771,beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet,992
4772,on the sensual mouth. The sodden eyes had kept something of the,992
4773,"loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely",992
4774,"passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat. Yes, it",992
4775,was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to recognize his own,992
4776,"brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was monstrous,",992
4777,"yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the",992
4778,"picture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long",992
4779,letters of bright vermilion.,992
4780,"It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never",993
4781,"done that. Still, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if",993
4782,his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own,993
4783,picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at,993
4784,"Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man. His mouth twitched, and his",993
4785,parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He passed his hand across,993
4786,his forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.,993
4787,"The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with",994
4788,that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are,994
4789,absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting. There was neither,994
4790,real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the,994
4791,"spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had taken",994
4792,"the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do",994
4793,so.,994
4794,"“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded",995
4795,shrill and curious in his ears.,995
4796,"“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in",996
4797,"his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my",996
4798,"good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who",996
4799,"explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me",996
4800,"that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even",996
4801,"now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you",996
4802,would call it a prayer....”,996
4803,"“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is",997
4804,impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The,997
4805,paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the,997
4806,thing is impossible.”,997
4807,"“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the",998
4808,"window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.",998
4809,“You told me you had destroyed it.”,999
4810,“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”,1000
4811,“I don’t believe it is my picture.”,1001
4812,“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.,1002
4813,"“My ideal, as you call it...”",1003
4814,“As you called it.”,1004
4815,"“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an",1005
4816,ideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”,1005
4817,“It is the face of my soul.”,1006
4818,“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a,1007
4819,devil.”,1007
4820,"“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a",1008
4821,wild gesture of despair.,1008
4822,Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it,1009
4823,"is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life,",1009
4824,"why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you",1009
4825,to be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The,1009
4826,surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was,1009
4827,"from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through",1009
4828,some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly,1009
4829,eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was,1009
4830,not so fearful.,1009
4831,"His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and",1010
4832,lay there sputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he,1010
4833,flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and,1010
4834,buried his face in his hands.,1010
4835,"“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was no",1011
4836,"answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,",1011
4837,"Dorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say in",1011
4838,one’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our sins. Wash,1011
4839,away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of your,1011
4840,pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered,1011
4841,also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped,1011
4842,yourself too much. We are both punished.”,1011
4843,Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed,1012
4844,"eyes. “It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.",1012
4845,"“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot",1013
4846,"remember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be",1013
4847,"as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”",1013
4848,“Those words mean nothing to me now.”,1014
4849,“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My God!,1015
4850,Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”,1015
4851,"Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable",1016
4852,"feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had",1016
4853,"been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his",1016
4854,ear by those grinning lips. The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred,1016
4855,"within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more",1016
4856,than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything. He glanced wildly,1016
4857,around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced,1016
4858,him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a knife that he,1016
4859,"had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had",1016
4860,"forgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing",1016
4861,"Hallward as he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and",1016
4862,turned round. Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.,1016
4863,He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind,1016
4864,"the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again",1016
4865,and again.,1016
4866,There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking,1017
4867,"with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively,",1017
4868,"waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice",1017
4869,"more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the",1017
4870,"floor. He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down. Then he",1017
4871,"threw the knife on the table, and listened.",1017
4872,"He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He",1018
4873,opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely,1018
4874,quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the,1018
4875,balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.,1018
4876,"Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in",1018
4877,as he did so.,1018
4878,"The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with",1019
4879,"bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been",1019
4880,for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was,1019
4881,"slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was",1019
4882,simply asleep.,1019
4883,"How quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking",1020
4884,"over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind",1020
4885,"had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s",1020
4886,"tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the",1020
4887,policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on,1020
4888,the doors of the silent houses. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom,1020
4889,gleamed at the corner and then vanished. A woman in a fluttering shawl,1020
4890,"was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went. Now and",1020
4891,"then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing in a hoarse",1020
4892,voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She,1020
4893,"stumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The",1020
4894,"gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their",1020
4895,"black iron branches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the",1020
4896,window behind him.,1020
4897,"Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not",1021
4898,even glance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole,1021
4899,thing was not to realize the situation. The friend who had painted the,1021
4900,fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his,1021
4901,life. That was enough.,1021
4902,Then he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish,1022
4903,"workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished",1022
4904,"steel, and studded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed",1022
4905,"by his servant, and questions would be asked. He hesitated for a",1022
4906,"moment, then he turned back and took it from the table. He could not",1022
4907,help seeing the dead thing. How still it was! How horribly white the,1022
4908,long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image.,1022
4909,"Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The",1023
4910,woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped,1023
4911,several times and waited. No: everything was still. It was merely the,1023
4912,sound of his own footsteps.,1023
4913,"When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.",1024
4914,They must be hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was,1024
4915,"in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises,",1024
4916,and put them into it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he,1024
4917,pulled out his watch. It was twenty minutes to two.,1024
4918,"He sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men were",1025
4919,strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of,1025
4920,murder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth....,1025
4921,"And yet, what evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left",1025
4922,the house at eleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the,1025
4923,servants were at Selby Royal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes.,1025
4924,"It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he",1025
4925,"had intended. With his curious reserved habits, it would be months",1025
4926,before any suspicions would be roused. Months! Everything could be,1025
4927,destroyed long before then.,1025
4928,A sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went,1026
4929,"out into the hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the",1026
4930,policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the,1026
4931,bull’s-eye reflected in the window. He waited and held his breath.,1026
4932,"After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting",1027
4933,the door very gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In,1027
4934,"about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very",1027
4935,drowsy.,1027
4936,"“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in;",1028
4937,“but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”,1028
4938,"“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and",1029
4939,blinking.,1029
4940,“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine,1030
4941,to-morrow. I have some work to do.”,1030
4942,"“All right, sir.”",1031
4943,“Did any one call this evening?”,1032
4944,"“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away",1033
4945,to catch his train.”,1033
4946,“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”,1034
4947,"“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not",1035
4948,find you at the club.”,1035
4949,"“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”",1036
4950,"“No, sir.”",1037
4951,The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.,1038
4952,Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the,1039
4953,"library. For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room,",1039
4954,biting his lip and thinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one,1039
4955,"of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152,",1039
4956,"Hertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.",1039
4957,CHAPTER XIV.,1043
4958,At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of,1045
4959,chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite,1045
4960,"peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his",1045
4961,"cheek. He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.",1045
4962,"The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as",1046
4963,"he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he",1046
4964,had been lost in some delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all.,1046
4965,His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But,1046
4966,youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.,1046
4967,"He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his",1047
4968,chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room. The,1047
4969,"sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost",1047
4970,like a morning in May.,1047
4971,"Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent,",1048
4972,blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there,1048
4973,with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had,1048
4974,"suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for",1048
4975,Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came,1048
4976,"back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still",1048
4977,"sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was!",1048
4978,"Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.",1048
4979,He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken,1049
4980,or grow mad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory,1049
4981,"than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride",1049
4982,"more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of",1049
4983,"joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the",1049
4984,senses. But this was not one of them. It was a thing to be driven out,1049
4985,"of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might",1049
4986,strangle one itself.,1049
4987,"When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and",1050
4988,then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual,1050
4989,"care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and",1050
4990,scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once. He spent a long time,1050
4991,"also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet",1050
4992,about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the,1050
4993,"servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence. At some of the",1050
4994,"letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One he read several times",1050
4995,over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.,1050
4996,"“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said.",1050
4997,"After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly",1051
4998,"with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the",1051
4999,"table, sat down and wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the",1051
5000,other he handed to the valet.,1051
5001,"“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell",1052
5002,"is out of town, get his address.”",1052
5003,"As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a",1053
5004,"piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and",1053
5005,then human faces. Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew,1053
5006,"seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and",1053
5007,"getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.",1053
5008,He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until,1053
5009,it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.,1053
5010,"When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page",1054
5011,"of the book. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s",1054
5012,"Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of",1054
5013,"citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted",1054
5014,pomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he,1054
5015,"turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of",1054
5016,"Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with",1054
5017,its downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own,1054
5018,"white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and",1054
5019,"passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:",1054
5020,"Sur une gamme chromatique,",1055
5021,"    Le sein de perles ruisselant,",1055
5022,La Vénus de l’Adriatique,1055
5023,    Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.,1055
5024,"Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes",1056
5025,"    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,",1056
5026,S’enflent comme des gorges rondes,1056
5027,    Que soulève un soupir d’amour.,1056
5028,"L’esquif aborde et me dépose,",1057
5029,"    Jetant son amarre au pilier,",1057
5030,"Devant une façade rose,",1057
5031,    Sur le marbre d’un escalier.,1057
5032,"How exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating",1059
5033,"down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black",1059
5034,gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked,1059
5035,to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as,1059
5036,one pushes out to the Lido. The sudden flashes of colour reminded him,1059
5037,of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the,1059
5038,"tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through",1059
5039,"the dim, dust-stained arcades. Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he",1059
5040,kept saying over and over to himself:,1059
5041,"“Devant une façade rose,",1060
5042,Sur le marbre d’un escalier.”,1060
5043,The whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn,1062
5044,"that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to",1062
5045,"mad delightful follies. There was romance in every place. But Venice,",1062
5046,"like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true",1062
5047,"romantic, background was everything, or almost everything. Basil had",1062
5048,"been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret. Poor",1062
5049,Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!,1062
5050,"He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read",1063
5051,of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna,1063
5052,where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned,1063
5053,merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each,1063
5054,other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps,1063
5055,tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by,1063
5056,"the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red",1063
5057,"ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small",1063
5058,beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood,1063
5059,"over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell",1063
5060,"of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the",1063
5061,“_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.,1063
5062,"But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a",1063
5063,horrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be,1063
5064,out of England? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he,1063
5065,might refuse to come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital,1063
5066,importance.,1063
5067,"They had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable,",1064
5068,indeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in,1064
5069,"society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never",1064
5070,did.,1064
5071,"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real",1065
5072,"appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the",1065
5073,beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian. His,1065
5074,dominant intellectual passion was for science. At Cambridge he had,1065
5075,"spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken",1065
5076,"a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year. Indeed, he was",1065
5077,"still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his",1065
5078,"own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the",1065
5079,"annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for",1065
5080,Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up,1065
5081,"prescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and",1065
5082,played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In,1065
5083,"fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray",1065
5084,together—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be,1065
5085,"able to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often",1065
5086,without being conscious of it. They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the,1065
5087,"night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always",1065
5088,seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on. For,1065
5089,eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at,1065
5090,"Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian",1065
5091,Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in,1065
5092,life. Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever,1065
5093,knew. But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they,1065
5094,met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at,1065
5095,"which Dorian Gray was present. He had changed, too—was strangely",1065
5096,"melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and",1065
5097,"would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called",1065
5098,"upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in",1065
5099,which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he seemed to,1065
5100,"become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice",1065
5101,in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious,1065
5102,experiments.,1065
5103,This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept,1066
5104,glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly,1066
5105,"agitated. At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room,",1066
5106,looking like a beautiful caged thing. He took long stealthy strides.,1066
5107,His hands were curiously cold.,1066
5108,The suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with,1067
5109,"feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the",1067
5110,jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting,1067
5111,"for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands",1067
5112,his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight,1067
5113,and driven the eyeballs back into their cave. It was useless. The brain,1067
5114,"had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made",1067
5115,"grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain,",1067
5116,danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving,1067
5117,"masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,",1067
5118,"slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being",1067
5119,"dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its",1067
5120,"grave, and showed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him",1067
5121,stone.,1067
5122,At last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes,1068
5123,upon him.,1068
5124,"“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man.",1069
5125,"A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back",1070
5126,to his cheeks.,1070
5127,"“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself",1071
5128,again. His mood of cowardice had passed away.,1071
5129,"The man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in,",1072
5130,"looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his",1072
5131,coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.,1072
5132,“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”,1073
5133,"“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it",1074
5134,was a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke,1074
5135,with slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady,1074
5136,searching gaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the,1074
5137,"pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the",1074
5138,gesture with which he had been greeted.,1074
5139,"“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one",1075
5140,person. Sit down.”,1075
5141,"Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The",1076
5142,two men’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that,1076
5143,what he was going to do was dreadful.,1076
5144,"After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very",1077
5145,"quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he",1077
5146,"had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room",1077
5147,"to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.",1077
5148,"He has been dead ten hours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like",1077
5149,"that. Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not",1077
5150,concern you. What you have to do is this—”,1077
5151,"“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what you",1078
5152,have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely decline,1078
5153,to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.,1078
5154,They don’t interest me any more.”,1078
5155,"“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest",1079
5156,"you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are",1079
5157,the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the,1079
5158,"matter. I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about",1079
5159,chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments. What you,1079
5160,have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it,1079
5161,so that not a vestige of it will be left. Nobody saw this person come,1079
5162,"into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in",1079
5163,"Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he is missed, there must",1079
5164,"be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change him, and",1079
5165,"everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may",1079
5166,scatter in the air.”,1079
5167,"“You are mad, Dorian.”",1080
5168,“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”,1081
5169,"“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to",1082
5170,"help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to",1082
5171,"do with this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril",1082
5172,my reputation for you? What is it to me what devil’s work you are up,1082
5173,to?”,1082
5174,"“It was suicide, Alan.”",1083
5175,"“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”",1084
5176,“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”,1085
5177,“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I,1086
5178,don’t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be,1086
5179,"sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of",1086
5180,"all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have",1086
5181,thought you knew more about people’s characters. Your friend Lord Henry,1086
5182,"Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he",1086
5183,has taught you. Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You,1086
5184,have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends. Don’t come to,1086
5185,me.”,1086
5186,"“Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don’t know what he had made me",1087
5187,"suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the",1087
5188,"marring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the",1087
5189,result was the same.”,1087
5190,"“Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not",1088
5191,"inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in",1088
5192,"the matter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime",1088
5193,without doing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.”,1088
5194,"“You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to",1089
5195,"me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain",1089
5196,"scientific experiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the",1089
5197,horrors that you do there don’t affect you. If in some hideous,1089
5198,dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a,1089
5199,leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow,1089
5200,"through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject. You",1089
5201,would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you were doing,1089
5202,"anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were",1089
5203,"benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the",1089
5204,"world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.",1089
5205,What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.,1089
5206,"Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are",1089
5207,"accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence",1089
5208,"against me. If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be",1089
5209,discovered unless you help me.”,1089
5210,“I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent,1090
5211,to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.”,1090
5212,"“Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you",1091
5213,came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some,1091
5214,day. No! don’t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the,1091
5215,scientific point of view. You don’t inquire where the dead things on,1091
5216,which you experiment come from. Don’t inquire now. I have told you too,1091
5217,"much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once,",1091
5218,Alan.”,1091
5219,"“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian—they are dead.”",1092
5220,“The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is,1093
5221,sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan!,1093
5222,"If you don’t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang",1093
5223,"me, Alan! Don’t you understand? They will hang me for what I have",1093
5224,done.”,1093
5225,“There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do,1094
5226,anything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.”,1094
5227,“You refuse?”,1095
5228,“Yes.”,1096
5229,"“I entreat you, Alan.”",1097
5230,“It is useless.”,1098
5231,The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes. Then he stretched,1099
5232,"out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read",1099
5233,"it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.",1099
5234,"Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.",1099
5235,"Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and",1100
5236,"opened it. As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back",1100
5237,in his chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if,1100
5238,his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.,1100
5239,"After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and",1101
5240,"came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.",1101
5241,"“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no",1102
5242,alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the,1102
5243,"address. If you don’t help me, I must send it. If you don’t help me, I",1102
5244,will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to,1102
5245,help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you.,1102
5246,"You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh,",1102
5247,offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me—no,1102
5248,"living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate",1102
5249,terms.”,1102
5250,"Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through",1103
5251,him.,1103
5252,"“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The",1104
5253,"thing is quite simple. Come, don’t work yourself into this fever. The",1104
5254,"thing has to be done. Face it, and do it.”",1104
5255,A groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The,1105
5256,ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing,1105
5257,"time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be",1105
5258,borne. He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his,1105
5259,"forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already",1105
5260,come upon him. The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.,1105
5261,It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him.,1105
5262,"“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”",1106
5263,"“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could alter",1107
5264,things.,1107
5265,“You must. You have no choice. Don’t delay.”,1108
5266,He hesitated a moment. “Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”,1109
5267,"“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”",1110
5268,“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”,1111
5269,"“No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of",1112
5270,notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the,1112
5271,things back to you.”,1112
5272,"Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope",1113
5273,to his assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then,1113
5274,"he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as",1113
5275,soon as possible and to bring the things with him.,1113
5276,"As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up",1114
5277,"from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a",1114
5278,"kind of ague. For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A",1114
5279,"fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was",1114
5280,like the beat of a hammer.,1114
5281,"As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian",1115
5282,"Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in",1115
5283,the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.,1115
5284,"“You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.",1115
5285,"“Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,” said Dorian.",1116
5286,“Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from,1117
5287,"corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In",1117
5288,doing what I am going to do—what you force me to do—it is not of your,1117
5289,life that I am thinking.”,1117
5290,"“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a thousandth",1118
5291,part of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away as he,1118
5292,spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.,1118
5293,"After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant",1119
5294,"entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil",1119
5295,of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.,1119
5296,"“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.",1120
5297,"“Yes,” said Dorian. “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another",1121
5298,errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies,1121
5299,Selby with orchids?”,1121
5300,"“Harden, sir.”",1122
5301,"“Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden",1123
5302,"personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered,",1123
5303,"and to have as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don’t want any",1123
5304,"white ones. It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty",1123
5305,place—otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”,1123
5306,"“No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?”",1124
5307,"Dorian looked at Campbell. “How long will your experiment take, Alan?”",1125
5308,he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third person in,1125
5309,the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.,1125
5310,"Campbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,” he",1126
5311,answered.,1126
5312,"“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,",1127
5313,Francis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have,1127
5314,"the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want",1127
5315,you.”,1127
5316,"“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.",1128
5317,"“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!",1129
5318,I’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and,1129
5319,in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left,1129
5320,the room together.,1129
5321,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned",1130
5322,"it in the lock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his",1130
5323,"eyes. He shuddered. “I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.",1130
5324,"“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly.",1131
5325,"Dorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his",1132
5326,portrait leering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn,1132
5327,curtain was lying. He remembered that the night before he had,1132
5328,"forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas,",1132
5329,"and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.",1132
5330,"What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on",1133
5331,"one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible",1133
5332,"it was!—more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent",1133
5333,"thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose",1133
5334,grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had,1133
5335,"not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.",1133
5336,"He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with",1134
5337,"half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that",1134
5338,"he would not look even once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and",1134
5339,"taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the",1134
5340,picture.,1134
5341,"There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed",1135
5342,themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard,1135
5343,"Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other",1135
5344,things that he had required for his dreadful work. He began to wonder,1135
5345,"if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had",1135
5346,thought of each other.,1135
5347,"“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.",1136
5348,"He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been",1137
5349,thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a,1137
5350,"glistening yellow face. As he was going downstairs, he heard the key",1137
5351,being turned in the lock.,1137
5352,It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He,1138
5353,"was pale, but absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,”",1138
5354,"he muttered. “And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.”",1138
5355,"“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said Dorian",1139
5356,simply.,1139
5357,"As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible",1140
5358,smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting,1140
5359,at the table was gone.,1140
5360,CHAPTER XV.,1144
5361,"That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large",1146
5362,"button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady",1146
5363,Narborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was,1146
5364,"throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his",1146
5365,manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as,1146
5366,ever. Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to,1146
5367,play a part. Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could,1146
5368,have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any,1146
5369,tragedy of our age. Those finely shaped fingers could never have,1146
5370,"clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God",1146
5371,and goodness. He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his,1146
5372,"demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a",1146
5373,double life.,1146
5374,"It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who",1147
5375,was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the,1147
5376,remains of really remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife,1147
5377,"to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband",1147
5378,"properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and",1147
5379,"married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted",1147
5380,"herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and",1147
5381,French _esprit_ when she could get it.,1147
5382,"Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that",1148
5383,"she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my",1148
5384,"dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say,",1148
5385,“and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most,1148
5386,"fortunate that you were not thought of at the time. As it was, our",1148
5387,"bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to",1148
5388,"raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.",1148
5389,"However, that was all Narborough’s fault. He was dreadfully",1148
5390,"short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who",1148
5391,never sees anything.”,1148
5392,"Her guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she",1149
5393,"explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married",1149
5394,"daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make",1149
5395,"matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her. “I think it",1149
5396,"is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and",1149
5397,"stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old",1149
5398,"woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake",1149
5399,them up. You don’t know what an existence they lead down there. It is,1149
5400,"pure unadulterated country life. They get up early, because they have",1149
5401,"so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to",1149
5402,think about. There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since,1149
5403,"the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep",1149
5404,after dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by me,1149
5405,and amuse me.”,1149
5406,Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes:,1150
5407,it was certainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen,1150
5408,"before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those",1150
5409,"middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies,",1150
5410,"but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an",1150
5411,"overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always",1150
5412,"trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to",1150
5413,her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against,1150
5414,"her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and",1150
5415,"Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy",1150
5416,"dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once",1150
5417,"seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked,",1150
5418,"white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the",1150
5419,impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of,1150
5420,ideas.,1150
5421,"He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the",1151
5422,great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the,1151
5423,"mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be",1151
5424,so late! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised,1151
5425,faithfully not to disappoint me.”,1151
5426,"It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door",1152
5427,opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some,1152
5428,"insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.",1152
5429,But at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away,1153
5430,untasted. Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an,1153
5431,"insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and",1153
5432,"now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence",1153
5433,and abstracted manner. From time to time the butler filled his glass,1153
5434,"with champagne. He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.",1153
5435,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being",1154
5436,"handed round, “what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out",1154
5437,of sorts.”,1154
5438,"“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is",1155
5439,afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I,1155
5440,certainly should.”,1155
5441,"“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in",1156
5442,"love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”",1156
5443,“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.,1157
5444,“I really cannot understand it.”,1157
5445,"“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl,",1158
5446,"Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and",1158
5447,your short frocks.”,1158
5448,"“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I",1159
5449,"remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_",1159
5450,she was then.”,1159
5451,"“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long",1160
5452,fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an,1160
5453,"_édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and",1160
5454,full of surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.,1160
5455,"When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”",1160
5456,"“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.",1161
5457,"“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess. “But her",1162
5458,"third husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”",1162
5459,"“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”",1163
5460,“I don’t believe a word of it.”,1164
5461,"“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”",1165
5462,"“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”",1166
5463,"“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked her",1167
5464,"whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and",1167
5465,"hung at her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had",1167
5466,had any hearts at all.”,1167
5467,“Four husbands! Upon my word that is _trop de zêle_.”,1168
5468,"“_Trop d’audace_, I tell her,” said Dorian.",1169
5469,"“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol",1170
5470,like? I don’t know him.”,1170
5471,"“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,”",1171
5472,"said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.",1171
5473,"Lady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all",1172
5474,surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”,1172
5475,"“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.",1173
5476,“It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent,1173
5477,terms.”,1173
5478,"“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,",1174
5479,shaking her head.,1174
5480,Lord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly,1175
5481,"monstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays saying",1175
5482,things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely,1175
5483,true.”,1175
5484,"“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.",1176
5485,"“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you all",1177
5486,"worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry",1177
5487,again so as to be in the fashion.”,1177
5488,"“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.",1178
5489,"“You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she",1178
5490,"detested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he",1178
5491,adored his first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”,1178
5492,"“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady.",1179
5493,"“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was the",1180
5494,"rejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,",1180
5495,"they will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never",1180
5496,"ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough,",1180
5497,but it is quite true.”,1180
5498,"“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for",1181
5499,"your defects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be",1181
5500,"married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however,",1181
5501,that that would alter you much. Nowadays all the married men live like,1181
5502,"bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”",1181
5503,"“_Fin de siêcle_,” murmured Lord Henry.",1182
5504,"“_Fin du globe_,” answered his hostess.",1183
5505,"“I wish it were _fin du globe_,” said Dorian with a sigh. “Life is a",1184
5506,great disappointment.”,1184
5507,"“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, “don’t",1185
5508,tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that one knows,1185
5509,"that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes",1185
5510,wish that I had been; but you are made to be good—you look so good. I,1185
5511,"must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr. Gray",1185
5512,should get married?”,1185
5513,"“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with a",1186
5514,bow.,1186
5515,"“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go",1187
5516,through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the,1187
5517,eligible young ladies.”,1187
5518,"“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian.",1188
5519,"“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done",1189
5520,in a hurry. I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable,1189
5521,"alliance, and I want you both to be happy.”",1189
5522,“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord,1190
5523,"Henry. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love",1190
5524,her.”,1190
5525,"“Ah! what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her chair",1191
5526,and nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon again.,1191
5527,"You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew",1191
5528,"prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet,",1191
5529,though. I want it to be a delightful gathering.”,1191
5530,"“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he answered.",1192
5531,“Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”,1192
5532,"“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up. “A thousand pardons,",1193
5533,"my dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you hadn’t finished your",1193
5534,cigarette.”,1193
5535,"“Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going",1194
5536,"to limit myself, for the future.”",1194
5537,"“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry. “Moderation is a fatal",1195
5538,thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a,1195
5539,feast.”,1195
5540,Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that,1196
5541,"to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she",1196
5542,"murmured, as she swept out of the room.",1196
5543,"“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,”",1197
5544,"cried Lady Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are sure to",1197
5545,squabble upstairs.”,1197
5546,"The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the",1198
5547,table and came up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and,1198
5548,sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the,1198
5549,situation in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The,1198
5550,word _doctrinaire_—word full of terror to the British mind—reappeared,1198
5551,from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served,1198
5552,as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles,1198
5553,of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common,1198
5554,sense he jovially termed it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for,1198
5555,society.,1198
5556,"A smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at",1199
5557,Dorian.,1199
5558,"“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed rather out of",1200
5559,sorts at dinner.”,1200
5560,"“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”",1201
5561,“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to,1202
5562,you. She tells me she is going down to Selby.”,1202
5563,“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”,1203
5564,"“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”",1204
5565,"“Oh, yes, Harry.”",1205
5566,"“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very",1206
5567,"clever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of",1206
5568,weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image,1206
5569,"precious. Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.",1206
5570,"White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and",1206
5571,"what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has had experiences.”",1206
5572,“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.,1207
5573,"“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is",1208
5574,"ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity,",1208
5575,with time thrown in. Who else is coming?”,1208
5576,"“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey",1209
5577,"Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”",1209
5578,"“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people don’t, but I find",1210
5579,him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by,1210
5580,being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern type.”,1210
5581,"“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go to",1211
5582,Monte Carlo with his father.”,1211
5583,“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By the,1212
5584,"way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.",1212
5585,What did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?”,1212
5586,Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.,1213
5587,"“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”",1214
5588,“Did you go to the club?”,1215
5589,"“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t mean that. I",1216
5590,didn’t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I did.... How,1216
5591,"inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been",1216
5592,doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at,1216
5593,"half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my",1216
5594,"latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any",1216
5595,"corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”",1216
5596,"Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let",1217
5597,"us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.",1217
5598,"Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not",1217
5599,yourself to-night.”,1217
5600,"“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall come",1218
5601,"round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady",1218
5602,Narborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”,1218
5603,"“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.",1219
5604,The duchess is coming.”,1219
5605,"“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he drove",1220
5606,"back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he",1220
5607,thought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual,1220
5608,"questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted",1220
5609,his nerve still. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He,1220
5610,winced. He hated the idea of even touching them.,1220
5611,"Yet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the",1221
5612,"door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had",1221
5613,thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled,1221
5614,another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning,1221
5615,leather was horrible. It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume,1221
5616,"everything. At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some",1221
5617,"Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and",1221
5618,forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.,1221
5619,"Suddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed",1222
5620,nervously at his underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large,1222
5621,"Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue",1222
5622,lapis. He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and,1222
5623,"make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet",1222
5624,almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving came over him. He,1222
5625,lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped till the,1222
5626,long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the,1222
5627,"cabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying,",1222
5628,"went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A",1222
5629,triangular drawer passed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively,1222
5630,"towards it, dipped in, and closed on something. It was a small Chinese",1222
5631,"box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides",1222
5632,"patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round",1222
5633,crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He opened it. Inside,1222
5634,"was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and",1222
5635,persistent.,1222
5636,"He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his",1223
5637,"face. Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly",1223
5638,"hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes",1223
5639,"to twelve. He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did",1223
5640,"so, and went into his bedroom.",1223
5641,"As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray,",1224
5642,"dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept",1224
5643,quietly out of his house. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good,1224
5644,horse. He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.,1224
5645,"The man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.",1225
5646,"“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have another if",1226
5647,you drive fast.”,1226
5648,"“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and",1227
5649,after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly,1227
5650,towards the river.,1227
5651,CHAPTER XVI.,1231
5652,"A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly",1233
5653,"in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men",1233
5654,and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some,1233
5655,"of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards",1233
5656,brawled and screamed.,1233
5657,"Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian",1234
5658,"Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and",1234
5659,now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said,1234
5660,"to him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the",1234
5661,"senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.",1234
5662,"He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium",1234
5663,"dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of",1234
5664,old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.,1234
5665,The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a,1235
5666,huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The,1235
5667,"gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the",1235
5668,man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from,1235
5669,the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom,1235
5670,were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.,1235
5671,"“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of",1236
5672,"the soul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was",1236
5673,sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent,1236
5674,blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there,1236
5675,"was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness",1236
5676,"was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing",1236
5677,"out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.",1236
5678,"Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done? Who",1236
5679,had made him a judge over others? He had said things that were,1236
5680,"dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.",1236
5681,"On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each",1237
5682,step. He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The,1237
5683,hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and,1237
5684,his delicate hands twitched nervously together. He struck at the horse,1237
5685,madly with his stick. The driver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in,1237
5686,"answer, and the man was silent.",1237
5687,"The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some",1238
5688,"sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist",1238
5689,"thickened, he felt afraid.",1238
5690,"Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and",1239
5691,"he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange,",1239
5692,"fanlike tongues of fire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in",1239
5693,the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a,1239
5694,"rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.",1239
5695,After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over,1240
5696,"rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then",1240
5697,fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind. He,1240
5698,watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made,1240
5699,gestures like live things. He hated them. A dull rage was in his heart.,1240
5700,"As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open",1240
5701,"door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards. The",1240
5702,driver beat at them with his whip.,1240
5703,It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with,1241
5704,hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped,1241
5705,"those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in",1241
5706,"them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by",1241
5707,"intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would",1241
5708,still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept,1241
5709,"the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all",1241
5710,"man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.",1241
5711,"Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real,",1241
5712,became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one,1241
5713,"reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of",1241
5714,"disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more",1241
5715,"vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious",1241
5716,"shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song. They were what he needed for",1241
5717,forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.,1241
5718,Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over,1242
5719,the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black,1242
5720,masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the,1242
5721,yards.,1242
5722,"“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the",1243
5723,trap.,1243
5724,"Dorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and",1244
5725,having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had,1244
5726,"promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and",1244
5727,there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The,1244
5728,light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an,1244
5729,outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like,1244
5730,a wet mackintosh.,1244
5731,"He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he",1245
5732,was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small,1245
5733,shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of,1245
5734,the top-windows stood a lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.,1245
5735,After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being,1246
5736,"unhooked. The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word",1246
5737,to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as,1246
5738,he passed. At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that,1246
5739,swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the,1246
5740,street. He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as,1246
5741,if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon. Shrill flaring,1246
5742,"gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced",1246
5743,"them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin",1246
5744,"backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered",1246
5745,"with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and",1246
5746,stained with dark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching,1246
5747,"by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing",1246
5748,"their white teeth as they chattered. In one corner, with his head",1246
5749,"buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily",1246
5750,"painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women,",1246
5751,mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an,1246
5752,"expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed",1246
5753,"one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in terror and",1246
5754,began to whimper.,1246
5755,"At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a",1247
5756,"darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the",1247
5757,"heavy odour of opium met him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils",1247
5758,"quivered with pleasure. When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow",1247
5759,"hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up",1247
5760,at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.,1247
5761,"“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.",1248
5762,"“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of the chaps",1249
5763,will speak to me now.”,1249
5764,“I thought you had left England.”,1250
5765,“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at,1251
5766,"last. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he added",1251
5767,"with a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.",1251
5768,I think I have had too many friends.”,1251
5769,Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such,1252
5770,"fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the",1252
5771,"gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in",1252
5772,"what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were",1252
5773,teaching them the secret of some new joy. They were better off than he,1252
5774,"was. He was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was",1252
5775,eating his soul away. From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of,1252
5776,Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could not stay. The,1252
5777,presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where no one,1252
5778,would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.,1252
5779,"“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.",1253
5780,“On the wharf?”,1254
5781,“Yes.”,1255
5782,“That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this place,1256
5783,now.”,1256
5784,Dorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women,1257
5785,"who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.”",1257
5786,“Much the same.”,1258
5787,“I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have,1259
5788,something.”,1259
5789,"“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man.",1260
5790,“Never mind.”,1261
5791,Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A,1262
5792,"half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous",1262
5793,greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of,1262
5794,them. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his back,1262
5795,on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.,1262
5796,"A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of",1263
5797,"the women. “We are very proud to-night,” she sneered.",1263
5798,"“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian, stamping his foot on",1264
5799,the ground. “What do you want? Money? Here it is. Don’t ever talk to me,1264
5800,again.”,1264
5801,"Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then",1265
5802,flickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and,1265
5803,raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion,1265
5804,watched her enviously.,1265
5805,"“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton. “I don’t care to go back. What",1266
5806,does it matter? I am quite happy here.”,1266
5807,"“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said Dorian,",1267
5808,after a pause.,1267
5809,“Perhaps.”,1268
5810,"“Good night, then.”",1269
5811,"“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping",1270
5812,his parched mouth with a handkerchief.,1270
5813,Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew,1271
5814,"the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the",1271
5815,woman who had taken his money. “There goes the devil’s bargain!” she,1271
5816,"hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.",1271
5817,"“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”",1272
5818,She snapped her fingers. “Prince Charming is what you like to be,1273
5819,"called, ain’t it?” she yelled after him.",1273
5820,"The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly",1274
5821,round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He,1274
5822,rushed out as if in pursuit.,1274
5823,Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His,1275
5824,"meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered",1275
5825,"if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as",1275
5826,Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his,1275
5827,"lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did",1275
5828,it matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of,1275
5829,another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life and,1275
5830,paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so,1275
5831,"often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed.",1275
5832,"In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.",1275
5833,"There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or",1276
5834,"for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of",1276
5835,"the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful",1276
5836,impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.,1276
5837,They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken,1276
5838,"from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all,",1276
5839,lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.,1276
5840,"For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of",1276
5841,"disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell",1276
5842,"from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.",1276
5843,"Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for",1277
5844,"rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but",1277
5845,"as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a",1277
5846,"short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself",1277
5847,"suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself,",1277
5848,"he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his",1277
5849,throat.,1277
5850,"He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the",1278
5851,"tightening fingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver,",1278
5852,"and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head,",1278
5853,"and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.",1278
5854,“What do you want?” he gasped.,1279
5855,"“Keep quiet,” said the man. “If you stir, I shoot you.”",1280
5856,“You are mad. What have I done to you?”,1281
5857,"“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and Sibyl Vane",1282
5858,was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your,1282
5859,door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.,1282
5860,"I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you",1282
5861,were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.,1282
5862,"I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night",1282
5863,you are going to die.”,1282
5864,"Dorian Gray grew sick with fear. “I never knew her,” he stammered. “I",1283
5865,never heard of her. You are mad.”,1283
5866,"“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you",1284
5867,are going to die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know,1284
5868,what to say or do. “Down on your knees!” growled the man. “I give you,1284
5869,one minute to make your peace—no more. I go on board to-night for,1284
5870,"India, and I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”",1284
5871,"Dorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know",1285
5872,"what to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,” he",1285
5873,"cried. “How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell me!”",1285
5874,"“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do years",1286
5875,matter?”,1286
5876,"“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his",1287
5877,voice. “Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”,1287
5878,"James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.",1288
5879,Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.,1288
5880,"Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him",1289
5881,"the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face",1289
5882,"of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the",1289
5883,unstained purity of youth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty,1289
5884,"summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been",1289
5885,when they had parted so many years ago. It was obvious that this was,1289
5886,not the man who had destroyed her life.,1289
5887,"He loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried, “and",1290
5888,I would have murdered you!”,1290
5889,Dorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of,1291
5890,"committing a terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly.",1291
5891,“Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own,1291
5892,hands.”,1291
5893,"“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A chance word",1292
5894,I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”,1292
5895,"“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into",1293
5896,"trouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the",1293
5897,street.,1293
5898,James Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head,1294
5899,"to foot. After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping",1294
5900,along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him,1294
5901,with stealthy footsteps. He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked,1294
5902,round with a start. It was one of the women who had been drinking at,1294
5903,the bar.,1294
5904,"“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite",1295
5905,close to his. “I knew you were following him when you rushed out from,1295
5906,"Daly’s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of money, and",1295
5907,he’s as bad as bad.”,1295
5908,"“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s",1296
5909,money. I want a man’s life. The man whose life I want must be nearly,1296
5910,"forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not",1296
5911,got his blood upon my hands.”,1296
5912,The woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she sneered.,1297
5913,"“Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me",1297
5914,what I am.”,1297
5915,“You lie!” cried James Vane.,1298
5916,"She raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the truth,”",1299
5917,she cried.,1299
5918,“Before God?”,1300
5919,“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes here.,1301
5920,They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s nigh,1301
5921,on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn’t changed much since then. I,1301
5922,"have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.",1301
5923,“You swear this?”,1302
5924,"“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. “But don’t give",1303
5925,"me away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him. Let me have some",1303
5926,money for my night’s lodging.”,1303
5927,"He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street,",1304
5928,"but Dorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had",1304
5929,vanished also.,1304
5930,CHAPTER XVII.,1308
5931,A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby,1310
5932,"Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband,",1310
5933,"a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time,",1310
5934,"and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the",1310
5935,table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at,1310
5936,which the duchess was presiding. Her white hands were moving daintily,1310
5937,"among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that",1310
5938,Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped,1310
5939,"wicker chair, looking at them. On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady",1310
5940,"Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last",1310
5941,Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection. Three young men,1310
5942,in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.,1310
5943,"The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more",1310
5944,expected to arrive on the next day.,1310
5945,"“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to",1311
5946,the table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about,1311
5947,"my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”",1311
5948,"“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess,",1312
5949,looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied with,1312
5950,"my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”",1312
5951,"“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are",1313
5952,both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an,1313
5953,"orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as",1313
5954,effective as the seven deadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one,1313
5955,of the gardeners what it was called. He told me it was a fine specimen,1313
5956,"of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind. It is a sad",1313
5957,"truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.",1313
5958,Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions. My one quarrel is,1313
5959,with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The,1313
5960,man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one. It,1313
5961,is the only thing he is fit for.”,1313
5962,"“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked.",1314
5963,"“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian.",1315
5964,"“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.",1316
5965,"“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair. “From a",1317
5966,label there is no escape! I refuse the title.”,1317
5967,"“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.",1318
5968,"“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”",1319
5969,“Yes.”,1320
5970,“I give the truths of to-morrow.”,1321
5971,"“I prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.",1322
5972,"“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.",1323
5973,"“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”",1324
5974,"“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.",1325
5975,"“That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too much.”",1326
5976,“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be,1327
5977,"beautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready",1327
5978,than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”,1327
5979,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the duchess.",1328
5980,“What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”,1328
5981,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good",1329
5982,"Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly",1329
5983,virtues have made our England what she is.”,1329
5984,"“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked.",1330
5985,“I live in it.”,1331
5986,“That you may censure it the better.”,1332
5987,“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.,1333
5988,“What do they say of us?”,1334
5989,“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”,1335
5990,"“Is that yours, Harry?”",1336
5991,“I give it to you.”,1337
5992,“I could not use it. It is too true.”,1338
5993,“You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a description.”,1339
5994,“They are practical.”,1340
5995,"“They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,",1341
5996,"they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”",1341
5997,"“Still, we have done great things.”",1342
5998,"“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”",1343
5999,“We have carried their burden.”,1344
6000,“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”,1345
6001,"She shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she cried.",1346
6002,“It represents the survival of the pushing.”,1347
6003,“It has development.”,1348
6004,“Decay fascinates me more.”,1349
6005,“What of art?” she asked.,1350
6006,“It is a malady.”,1351
6007,“Love?”,1352
6008,“An illusion.”,1353
6009,“Religion?”,1354
6010,“The fashionable substitute for belief.”,1355
6011,“You are a sceptic.”,1356
6012,“Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”,1357
6013,“What are you?”,1358
6014,“To define is to limit.”,1359
6015,“Give me a clue.”,1360
6016,“Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”,1361
6017,“You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.”,1362
6018,“Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince,1363
6019,Charming.”,1363
6020,"“Ah! don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray.",1364
6021,"“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess,",1365
6022,colouring. “I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely,1365
6023,scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern,1365
6024,butterfly.”,1365
6025,"“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed Dorian.",1366
6026,"“Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.”",1367
6027,"“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”",1368
6028,"“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I",1369
6029,come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by,1369
6030,half-past eight.”,1369
6031,“How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.”,1370
6032,"“I daren’t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember the",1371
6033,"one I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden-party? You don’t, but it is nice",1371
6034,"of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All",1371
6035,good hats are made out of nothing.”,1371
6036,"“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry. “Every",1372
6037,effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be,1372
6038,a mediocrity.”,1372
6039,"“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule",1373
6040,"the world. I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities. We women, as some",1373
6041,"one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if",1373
6042,you ever love at all.”,1373
6043,"“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian.",1374
6044,"“Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess with",1375
6045,mock sadness.,1375
6046,“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry. “How can you say that? Romance,1376
6047,"lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.",1376
6048,"Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.",1376
6049,Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely,1376
6050,"intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best,",1376
6051,and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as,1376
6052,possible.”,1376
6053,"“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess after",1377
6054,a pause.,1377
6055,"“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry.",1378
6056,The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression,1379
6057,"in her eyes. “What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired.",1379
6058,Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.,1380
6059,"“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”",1380
6060,“Even when he is wrong?”,1381
6061,"“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”",1382
6062,“And does his philosophy make you happy?”,1383
6063,“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have,1384
6064,searched for pleasure.”,1384
6065,"“And found it, Mr. Gray?”",1385
6066,“Often. Too often.”,1386
6067,"The duchess sighed. “I am searching for peace,” she said, “and if I",1387
6068,"don’t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.”",1387
6069,"“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to his",1388
6070,feet and walking down the conservatory.,1388
6071,"“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his",1389
6072,cousin. “You had better take care. He is very fascinating.”,1389
6073,"“If he were not, there would be no battle.”",1390
6074,"“Greek meets Greek, then?”",1391
6075,“I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.”,1392
6076,“They were defeated.”,1393
6077,"“There are worse things than capture,” she answered.",1394
6078,“You gallop with a loose rein.”,1395
6079,"“Pace gives life,” was the _riposte_.",1396
6080,“I shall write it in my diary to-night.”,1397
6081,“What?”,1398
6082,“That a burnt child loves the fire.”,1399
6083,“I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.”,1400
6084,"“You use them for everything, except flight.”",1401
6085,“Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for us.”,1402
6086,“You have a rival.”,1403
6087,“Who?”,1404
6088,"He laughed. “Lady Narborough,” he whispered. “She perfectly adores",1405
6089,him.”,1405
6090,“You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us,1406
6091,who are romanticists.”,1406
6092,“Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.”,1407
6093,“Men have educated us.”,1408
6094,“But not explained you.”,1409
6095,"“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge.",1410
6096,“Sphinxes without secrets.”,1411
6097,"She looked at him, smiling. “How long Mr. Gray is!” she said. “Let us",1412
6098,go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.”,1412
6099,"“Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”",1413
6100,“That would be a premature surrender.”,1414
6101,“Romantic art begins with its climax.”,1415
6102,“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”,1416
6103,“In the Parthian manner?”,1417
6104,“They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.”,1418
6105,"“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly had he",1419
6106,finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came,1419
6107,"a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody",1419
6108,started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in,1419
6109,"his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian",1419
6110,Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.,1419
6111,He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of,1420
6112,"the sofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with",1420
6113,a dazed expression.,1420
6114,"“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?”",1421
6115,He began to tremble.,1421
6116,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted. That was",1422
6117,all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to,1422
6118,dinner. I will take your place.”,1422
6119,"“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I would",1423
6120,rather come down. I must not be alone.”,1423
6121,He went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of,1424
6122,"gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of",1424
6123,"terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the",1424
6124,"window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the",1424
6125,face of James Vane watching him.,1424
6126,CHAPTER XVIII.,1428
6127,"The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the",1430
6128,"time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet",1430
6129,"indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared,",1430
6130,"tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but",1430
6131,"tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against",1430
6132,the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild,1430
6133,"regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face",1430
6134,"peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to",1430
6135,lay its hand upon his heart.,1430
6136,But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of,1431
6137,the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual,1431
6138,"life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the",1431
6139,imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of,1431
6140,sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen,1431
6141,"brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor",1431
6142,"the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon",1431
6143,"the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round",1431
6144,"the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers. Had",1431
6145,"any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have",1431
6146,"reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had",1431
6147,not come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in,1431
6148,"some winter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did",1431
6149,"not know who he was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had",1431
6150,saved him.,1431
6151,"And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think",1432
6152,"that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them",1432
6153,"visible form, and make them move before one! What sort of life would",1432
6154,"his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from",1432
6155,"silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear",1432
6156,"as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!",1432
6157,"As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and",1432
6158,the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh! in what a,1432
6159,wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere,1432
6160,memory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back,1432
6161,"to him with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and",1432
6162,"swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in",1432
6163,"at six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.",1432
6164,It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was,1433
6165,"something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that",1433
6166,seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it,1433
6167,was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused,1433
6168,the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish,1433
6169,that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle,1433
6170,and finely wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions,1433
6171,"must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves",1433
6172,die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows,1433
6173,"that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had",1433
6174,convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken,1433
6175,"imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity",1433
6176,and not a little of contempt.,1433
6177,"After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden",1434
6178,and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp,1434
6179,frost lay like salt upon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue,1434
6180,"metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.",1434
6181,At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey,1435
6182,"Clouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of",1435
6183,"his gun. He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the",1435
6184,"mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken",1435
6185,and rough undergrowth.,1435
6186,"“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.",1436
6187,"“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the",1437
6188,"open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new",1437
6189,ground.”,1437
6190,"Dorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and",1438
6191,"red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters",1438
6192,"ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that",1438
6193,"followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful",1438
6194,"freedom. He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high",1438
6195,indifference of joy.,1438
6196,Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front,1439
6197,"of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it",1439
6198,"forward, started a hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir",1439
6199,"Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the",1439
6200,"animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he",1439
6201,"cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”",1439
6202,"“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded",1440
6203,"into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a",1440
6204,"hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is",1440
6205,worse.,1440
6206,“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. “What an,1441
6207,ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting there!” he,1441
6208,called out at the top of his voice. “A man is hurt.”,1441
6209,The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.,1442
6210,"“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing",1443
6211,ceased along the line.,1443
6212,"“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.",1444
6213,“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the,1444
6214,day.”,1444
6215,"Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the",1445
6216,"lithe swinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging",1445
6217,a body after them into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It,1445
6218,seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir,1445
6219,"Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of",1445
6220,the keeper. The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with,1445
6221,faces. There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of,1445
6222,voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the,1445
6223,boughs overhead.,1445
6224,"After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like",1446
6225,endless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started,1446
6226,and looked round.,1446
6227,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is",1447
6228,stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.”,1447
6229,"“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly. “The",1448
6230,whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”,1448
6231,He could not finish the sentence.,1449
6232,"“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole charge of shot",1450
6233,in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go,1450
6234,home.”,1450
6235,They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly,1451
6236,fifty yards without speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and,1451
6237,"said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”",1451
6238,"“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear",1452
6239,"fellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why did he get",1452
6240,"in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather",1452
6241,"awkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It",1452
6242,makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he,1452
6243,shoots very straight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”,1452
6244,"Dorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something",1453
6245,"horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he",1453
6246,"added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.",1453
6247,The elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is,1454
6248,"_ennui_, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.",1454
6249,But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep,1454
6250,chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the,1454
6251,"subject is to be tabooed. As for omens, there is no such thing as an",1454
6252,omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She is too wise or too cruel,1454
6253,"for that. Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have",1454
6254,everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would,1454
6255,not be delighted to change places with you.”,1454
6256,"“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t",1455
6257,laugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who,1455
6258,has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is,1455
6259,the coming of death that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to,1455
6260,wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man,1455
6261,"moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”",1455
6262,Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand,1456
6263,"was pointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for",1456
6264,you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the,1456
6265,"table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must",1456
6266,"come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”",1456
6267,Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The,1457
6268,"man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating",1457
6269,"manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her",1457
6270,"Grace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured.",1457
6271,Dorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming,1458
6272,"in,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the",1458
6273,direction of the house.,1458
6274,“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry. “It,1459
6275,is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt,1459
6276,with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”,1459
6277,"“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present",1460
6278,"instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I",1460
6279,don’t love her.”,1460
6280,"“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you",1461
6281,are excellently matched.”,1461
6282,"“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for",1462
6283,scandal.”,1462
6284,"“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry,",1463
6285,lighting a cigarette.,1463
6286,"“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”",1464
6287,"“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.",1465
6288,"“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in",1466
6289,his voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the,1466
6290,desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has,1466
6291,"become a burden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was",1466
6292,silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to,1466
6293,Harvey to have the yacht got ready. On a yacht one is safe.”,1466
6294,"“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what",1467
6295,it is? You know I would help you.”,1467
6296,"“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I dare say it is",1468
6297,only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a,1468
6298,horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”,1468
6299,“What nonsense!”,1469
6300,"“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess,",1470
6301,"looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,",1470
6302,Duchess.”,1470
6303,"“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor Geoffrey is",1471
6304,terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.,1471
6305,How curious!”,1471
6306,"“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some whim,",1472
6307,I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am,1472
6308,sorry they told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”,1472
6309,"“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no",1473
6310,psychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on,1473
6311,"purpose, how interesting he would be! I should like to know some one",1473
6312,who had committed a real murder.”,1473
6313,"“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?",1474
6314,"Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”",1474
6315,"Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,",1475
6316,"Duchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That is",1475
6317,all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what,1475
6318,Harry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think,1475
6319,"I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”",1475
6320,They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the,1476
6321,"conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian,",1476
6322,Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.,1476
6323,“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked.,1476
6324,"She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I",1477
6325,"wish I knew,” she said at last.",1477
6326,He shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty,1478
6327,that charms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”,1478
6328,“One may lose one’s way.”,1479
6329,"“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”",1480
6330,“What is that?”,1481
6331,“Disillusion.”,1482
6332,"“It was my _début_ in life,” she sighed.",1483
6333,“It came to you crowned.”,1484
6334,“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”,1485
6335,“They become you.”,1486
6336,“Only in public.”,1487
6337,"“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry.",1488
6338,“I will not part with a petal.”,1489
6339,“Monmouth has ears.”,1490
6340,“Old age is dull of hearing.”,1491
6341,“Has he never been jealous?”,1492
6342,“I wish he had been.”,1493
6343,He glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking,1494
6344,for?” she inquired.,1494
6345,"“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped it.”",1495
6346,She laughed. “I have still the mask.”,1496
6347,"“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.",1497
6348,She laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet,1498
6349,fruit.,1498
6350,"Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror",1499
6351,in every tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too,1499
6352,hideous a burden for him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky,1499
6353,"beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to",1499
6354,pre-figure death for himself also. He had nearly swooned at what Lord,1499
6355,Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.,1499
6356,At five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to,1500
6357,"pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham",1500
6358,at the door by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another,1500
6359,night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in,1500
6360,the sunlight. The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.,1500
6361,"Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to",1501
6362,town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in,1501
6363,"his absence. As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to",1501
6364,"the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see",1501
6365,"him. He frowned and bit his lip. “Send him in,” he muttered, after some",1501
6366,moments’ hesitation.,1501
6367,"As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a",1502
6368,drawer and spread it out before him.,1502
6369,“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this,1503
6370,"morning, Thornton?” he said, taking up a pen.",1503
6371,"“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper.",1504
6372,“Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?”,1505
6373,"asked Dorian, looking bored. “If so, I should not like them to be left",1505
6374,"in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”",1505
6375,"“We don’t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of",1506
6376,coming to you about.”,1506
6377,"“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly. “What do you mean?",1507
6378,Wasn’t he one of your men?”,1507
6379,"“No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.”",1508
6380,"The pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart",1509
6381,had suddenly stopped beating. “A sailor?” he cried out. “Did you say a,1509
6382,sailor?”,1509
6383,"“Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on",1510
6384,"both arms, and that kind of thing.”",1510
6385,"“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and",1511
6386,looking at the man with startled eyes. “Anything that would tell his,1511
6387,name?”,1511
6388,"“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any",1512
6389,"kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we",1512
6390,think.”,1512
6391,Dorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He,1513
6392,clutched at it madly. “Where is the body?” he exclaimed. “Quick! I must,1513
6393,see it at once.”,1513
6394,"“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t like to",1514
6395,have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad,1514
6396,luck.”,1514
6397,“The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to,1515
6398,bring my horse round. No. Never mind. I’ll go to the stables myself. It,1515
6399,will save time.”,1515
6400,"In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the",1516
6401,long avenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him,1516
6402,"in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his",1516
6403,path. Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.,1516
6404,He lashed her across the neck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air,1516
6405,like an arrow. The stones flew from her hoofs.,1516
6406,At last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard.,1517
6407,He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the,1517
6408,farthest stable a light was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him,1517
6409,"that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand",1517
6410,upon the latch.,1517
6411,"There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a",1518
6412,discovery that would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the,1518
6413,door open and entered.,1518
6414,On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man,1519
6415,dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted,1519
6416,"handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a",1519
6417,"bottle, sputtered beside it.",1519
6418,Dorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take,1520
6419,"the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to",1520
6420,come to him.,1520
6421,"“Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,” he said, clutching at",1521
6422,the door-post for support.,1521
6423,"When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy",1522
6424,broke from his lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James,1522
6425,Vane.,1522
6426,He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode,1523
6427,"home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.",1523
6428,CHAPTER XIX.,1527
6429,"“There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,” cried",1529
6430,"Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled",1529
6431,"with rose-water. “You are quite perfect. Pray, don’t change.”",1529
6432,"Dorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful",1530
6433,things in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good,1530
6434,actions yesterday.”,1530
6435,“Where were you yesterday?”,1531
6436,"“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”",1532
6437,"“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the",1533
6438,country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people,1533
6439,who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not,1533
6440,by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by,1533
6441,"which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being",1533
6442,"corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they",1533
6443,stagnate.”,1533
6444,"“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known something of",1534
6445,both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found,1534
6446,"together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I",1534
6447,have altered.”,1534
6448,“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you,1535
6449,had done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his,1535
6450,"plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a",1535
6451,"perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.",1535
6452,"“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else.",1536
6453,"I spared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She",1536
6454,was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was,1536
6455,"that which first attracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you?",1536
6456,"How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of",1536
6457,course. She was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her. I,1536
6458,am quite sure that I loved her. All during this wonderful May that we,1536
6459,"have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a",1536
6460,week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept,1536
6461,"tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We were to have gone",1536
6462,away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to leave her,1536
6463,as flowerlike as I had found her.”,1536
6464,“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill,1537
6465,"of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can finish",1537
6466,your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That,1537
6467,was the beginning of your reformation.”,1537
6468,"“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.",1538
6469,"Hetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But",1538
6470,"there is no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her",1538
6471,garden of mint and marigold.”,1538
6472,"“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he",1539
6473,"leaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously",1539
6474,boyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now,1539
6475,with any one of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to,1539
6476,"a rough carter or a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met",1539
6477,"you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will",1539
6478,"be wretched. From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much",1539
6479,"of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor. Besides,",1539
6480,how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some,1539
6481,"starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”",1539
6482,"“I can’t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the",1540
6483,most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what,1540
6484,you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I,1540
6485,"rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window,",1540
6486,"like a spray of jasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t",1540
6487,"try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years,",1540
6488,"the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a",1540
6489,sort of sin. I want to be better. I am going to be better. Tell me,1540
6490,something about yourself. What is going on in town? I have not been to,1540
6491,the club for days.”,1540
6492,“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”,1541
6493,"“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said",1542
6494,"Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.",1542
6495,"“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and",1543
6496,the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having,1543
6497,more than one topic every three months. They have been very fortunate,1543
6498,"lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s",1543
6499,suicide. Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.,1543
6500,Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left,1543
6501,for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor,1543
6502,"Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris",1543
6503,at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has,1543
6504,"been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who",1543
6505,disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful,1543
6506,"city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”",1543
6507,"“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his",1544
6508,Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could,1544
6509,discuss the matter so calmly.,1544
6510,"“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is",1545
6511,"no business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.",1545
6512,Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”,1545
6513,“Why?” said the younger man wearily.,1546
6514,"“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt",1547
6515,"trellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything",1547
6516,nowadays except that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the,1547
6517,nineteenth century that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee,1547
6518,"in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with",1547
6519,whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was,1547
6520,"very fond of her. The house is rather lonely without her. Of course,",1547
6521,"married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But then one regrets the",1547
6522,loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most.,1547
6523,They are such an essential part of one’s personality.”,1547
6524,"Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next",1548
6525,"room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white",1548
6526,"and black ivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he",1548
6527,"stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever",1548
6528,occur to you that Basil was murdered?”,1548
6529,"Lord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury",1549
6530,watch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to,1549
6531,"have enemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a",1549
6532,man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was,1549
6533,"really rather dull. He only interested me once, and that was when he",1549
6534,"told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you",1549
6535,were the dominant motive of his art.”,1549
6536,"“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his",1550
6537,voice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”,1550
6538,"“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all",1551
6539,"probable. I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not",1551
6540,the sort of man to have gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his,1551
6541,chief defect.”,1551
6542,"“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?”",1552
6543,said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had spoken.,1552
6544,"“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that",1553
6545,"doesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.",1553
6546,"It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your",1553
6547,"vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs",1553
6548,exclusively to the lower orders. I don’t blame them in the smallest,1553
6549,"degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply",1553
6550,a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”,1553
6551,"“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who",1554
6552,has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?,1554
6553,Don’t tell me that.”,1554
6554,"“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord",1555
6555,"Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life. I",1555
6556,"should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should",1555
6557,never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us,1555
6558,pass from poor Basil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a,1555
6559,"really romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell",1555
6560,into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the,1555
6561,scandal. Yes: I should fancy that was his end. I see him lying now on,1555
6562,"his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating",1555
6563,"over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do you know, I don’t",1555
6564,think he would have done much more good work. During the last ten years,1555
6565,his painting had gone off very much.”,1555
6566,"Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began",1556
6567,"to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged",1556
6568,"bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo",1556
6569,"perch. As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of",1556
6570,"crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards",1556
6571,and forwards.,1556
6572,"“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of",1557
6573,his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have,1557
6574,lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be,1557
6575,"great friends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated",1557
6576,"you? I suppose he bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit",1557
6577,"bores have. By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he",1557
6578,did of you? I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh!,1557
6579,I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to,1557
6580,"Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way. You never got",1557
6581,it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted,1557
6582,to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil’s best period. Since,1557
6583,"then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good",1557
6584,intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative,1557
6585,British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”,1557
6586,"“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really liked it.",1558
6587,I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me. Why,1558
6588,do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some,1558
6589,"play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—",1558
6590,"“Like the painting of a sorrow,",1559
6591,A face without a heart.”,1559
6592,Yes: that is what it was like.”,1561
6593,"Lord Henry laughed. “If a man treats life artistically, his brain is",1562
6594,"his heart,” he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.",1562
6595,Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.,1563
6596,"“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated, “‘a face without a",1563
6597,heart.’”,1563
6598,The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. “By the,1564
6599,"way, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he",1564
6600,gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation run?—his own,1564
6601,soul’?”,1564
6602,"The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.",1565
6603,"“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”",1565
6604,"“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise,",1566
6605,“I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.,1566
6606,"That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the",1566
6607,Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people,1566
6608,"listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the",1566
6609,man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being,1566
6610,rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. A,1566
6611,"wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly",1566
6612,"white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful",1566
6613,phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very,1566
6614,"good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of telling the prophet",1566
6615,"that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid, however, he",1566
6616,would not have understood me.”,1566
6617,"“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and",1567
6618,"sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is",1567
6619,a soul in each one of us. I know it.”,1567
6620,"“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”",1568
6621,“Quite sure.”,1569
6622,“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely,1570
6623,"certain about are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the",1570
6624,lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have,1570
6625,you or I to do with the superstitions of our age? No: we have given up,1570
6626,"our belief in the soul. Play me something. Play me a nocturne, Dorian,",1570
6627,"and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your",1570
6628,youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you,1570
6629,"are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are really wonderful,",1570
6630,Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You,1570
6631,"remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky, very shy,",1570
6632,"and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in",1570
6633,appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth,1570
6634,"I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early,",1570
6635,or be respectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk,1570
6636,of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen,1570
6637,now with any respect are people much younger than myself. They seem in,1570
6638,front of me. Life has revealed to them her latest wonder. As for the,1570
6639,"aged, I always contradict the aged. I do it on principle. If you ask",1570
6640,"them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly",1570
6641,"give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks,",1570
6642,"believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing. How lovely that",1570
6643,"thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca,",1570
6644,with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against,1570
6645,the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that,1570
6646,there is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want,1570
6647,music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I,1570
6648,"am Marsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that",1570
6649,even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is,1570
6650,"old, but that one is young. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.",1570
6651,"Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had! You",1570
6652,have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against,1570
6653,your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to,1570
6654,you no more than the sound of music. It has not marred you. You are,1570
6655,still the same.”,1570
6656,"“I am not the same, Harry.”",1571
6657,"“Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.",1572
6658,Don’t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.,1572
6659,Don’t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need,1572
6660,"not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive",1572
6661,yourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question,1572
6662,"of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides",1572
6663,itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and,1572
6664,think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a,1572
6665,"morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that",1572
6666,"brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you",1572
6667,"had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had",1572
6668,"ceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that",1572
6669,our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own,1572
6670,senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of,1572
6671,"_lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the",1572
6672,strangest month of my life over again. I wish I could change places,1572
6673,"with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has",1572
6674,always worshipped you. It always will worship you. You are the type of,1572
6675,"what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found. I am",1572
6676,"so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or",1572
6677,"painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself! Life has",1572
6678,been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your,1572
6679,sonnets.”,1572
6680,Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.,1573
6681,"“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to",1573
6682,"have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant",1573
6683,things to me. You don’t know everything about me. I think that if you,1573
6684,"did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”",1573
6685,"“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne",1574
6686,"over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the",1574
6687,"dusky air. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she",1574
6688,"will come closer to the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then.",1574
6689,"It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is",1574
6690,"some one at White’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole,",1574
6691,"Bournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has",1574
6692,begged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather,1574
6693,reminds me of you.”,1574
6694,"“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I am tired",1575
6695,"to-night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven, and I",1575
6696,want to go to bed early.”,1575
6697,“Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was,1576
6698,something in your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than,1576
6699,I had ever heard from it before.”,1576
6700,"“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling. “I am a",1577
6701,little changed already.”,1577
6702,"“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and I will",1578
6703,always be friends.”,1578
6704,“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that.,1579
6705,"Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It",1579
6706,does harm.”,1579
6707,"“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be",1580
6708,"going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people",1580
6709,against all the sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too,1580
6710,"delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use. You and I are what we",1580
6711,"are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book,",1580
6712,there is no such thing as that. Art has no influence upon action. It,1580
6713,annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that,1580
6714,the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.,1580
6715,That is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I,1580
6716,"am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you",1580
6717,"to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and",1580
6718,wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.,1580
6719,Mind you come. Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she,1580
6720,never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you,1580
6721,"would be. Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be",1580
6722,here at eleven.”,1580
6723,"“Must I really come, Harry?”",1581
6724,“Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don’t think there have been,1582
6725,such lilacs since the year I met you.”,1582
6726,"“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good night,",1583
6727,"Harry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had",1583
6728,something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.,1583
6729,CHAPTER XX.,1587
6730,"It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and",1589
6731,"did not even put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home,",1589
6732,"smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He",1589
6733,"heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He",1589
6734,"remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared",1589
6735,"at, or talked about. He was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the",1589
6736,charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that,1589
6737,no one knew who he was. He had often told the girl whom he had lured to,1589
6738,"love him that he was poor, and she had believed him. He had told her",1589
6739,"once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that",1589
6740,wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a laugh she,1589
6741,had!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in her,1589
6742,"cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had",1589
6743,everything that he had lost.,1589
6744,"When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent",1590
6745,"him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and",1590
6746,began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.,1590
6747,Was it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing,1591
6748,"for the unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord",1591
6749,"Henry had once called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled",1591
6750,his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had,1591
6751,"been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in",1591
6752,"being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been",1591
6753,the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.,1591
6754,But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him?,1591
6755,Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that,1592
6756,"the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the",1592
6757,unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to,1592
6758,that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure,1592
6759,swift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment. Not,1592
6760,“Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the,1592
6761,prayer of man to a most just God.,1592
6762,"The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many",1593
6763,"years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids",1593
6764,"laughed round it as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night",1593
6765,"of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and",1593
6766,"with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some",1593
6767,"one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending",1593
6768,with these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made,1593
6769,of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The,1593
6770,"phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to",1593
6771,"himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the",1593
6772,"floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his",1593
6773,"beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed",1593
6774,"for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from",1593
6775,"stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.",1593
6776,"What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow",1593
6777,"moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had",1593
6778,spoiled him.,1593
6779,It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It,1594
6780,"was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane",1594
6781,was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had,1594
6782,"shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the",1594
6783,"secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was,",1594
6784,over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away. It was,1594
6785,"already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the",1594
6786,death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the,1594
6787,living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the,1594
6788,portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It,1594
6789,was the portrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him,1594
6790,"that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The",1594
6791,"murder had been simply the madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell,",1594
6792,his suicide had been his own act. He had chosen to do it. It was,1594
6793,nothing to him.,1594
6794,A new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for.,1595
6795,"Surely he had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at",1595
6796,any rate. He would never again tempt innocence. He would be good.,1595
6797,"As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in",1596
6798,the locked room had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it,1596
6799,"had been? Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel",1596
6800,every sign of evil passion from the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had,1596
6801,already gone away. He would go and look.,1596
6802,He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the,1597
6803,"door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face",1597
6804,"and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and",1597
6805,the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror,1597
6806,to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.,1597
6807,"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and",1598
6808,dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and,1598
6809,"indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the",1598
6810,eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of,1598
6811,"the hypocrite. The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if",1598
6812,"possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed",1598
6813,"brighter, and more like blood newly spilled. Then he trembled. Had it",1598
6814,been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed? Or the,1598
6815,"desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking",1598
6816,laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things,1598
6817,"finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the",1598
6818,red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a,1598
6819,horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the,1598
6820,"painted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand",1598
6821,that had not held the knife. Confess? Did it mean that he was to,1598
6822,confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He laughed. He felt,1598
6823,"that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess, who would",1598
6824,believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.,1598
6825,Everything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned,1598
6826,what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad.,1598
6827,They would shut him up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his,1598
6828,"duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.",1598
6829,There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well,1598
6830,as to heaven. Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had,1598
6831,told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged his shoulders. The death of,1598
6832,Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty,1598
6833,"Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he",1598
6834,was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing,1598
6835,more in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At,1598
6836,least he thought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing,1598
6837,more. Through vanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the,1598
6838,mask of goodness. For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.,1598
6839,He recognized that now.,1598
6840,But this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be,1599
6841,burdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only,1599
6842,one bit of evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was,1599
6843,evidence. He would destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had,1599
6844,given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old. Of late he had,1599
6845,felt no such pleasure. It had kept him awake at night. When he had been,1599
6846,"away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon",1599
6847,it. It had brought melancholy across his passions. Its mere memory had,1599
6848,"marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him. Yes, it",1599
6849,had been conscience. He would destroy it.,1599
6850,He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He,1600
6851,"had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was",1600
6852,"bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill",1600
6853,"the painter’s work, and all that that meant. It would kill the past,",1600
6854,"and when that was dead, he would be free. It would kill this monstrous",1600
6855,"soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace. He",1600
6856,"seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.",1600
6857,"There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its",1601
6858,agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.,1601
6859,"Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked",1601
6860,up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and,1601
6861,"brought him back. The man rang the bell several times, but there was no",1601
6862,"answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all",1601
6863,"dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and",1601
6864,watched.,1601
6865,"“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.",1602
6866,"“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.",1603
6867,"They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of",1604
6868,them was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.,1604
6869,"Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics",1605
6870,were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying,1605
6871,and wringing her hands. Francis was as pale as death.,1605
6872,"After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the",1606
6873,"footmen and crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They",1606
6874,"called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force",1606
6875,"the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The",1606
6876,windows yielded easily—their bolts were old.,1606
6877,"When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait",1607
6878,"of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his",1607
6879,"exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in",1607
6880,"evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled,",1607
6881,and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings,1607
6882,that they recognized who it was.,1607
6883,THE END,1608
