0,THE PREFACE,0
1, The artist is the creator of beautiful things.,1
2,To reveal art and conceal the artist is art’s aim.,1
3,The critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.,1
4,The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.,2
5,Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.,2
6,This is a fault.,2
7,Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.,3
8,For these there is hope.,3
9,They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.,3
10,There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.,4
11,"Books are well written, or badly written.",4
12,That is all.,4
13,The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.,5
14,The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his own face in a glass.,6
15,"The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.",6
16,No artist desires to prove anything.,6
17,Even things that are true can be proved.,6
18,No artist has ethical sympathies.,6
19,An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.,6
20,No artist is ever morbid.,6
21,The artist can express everything.,6
22,Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.,6
23,Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.,6
24,"From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.",6
25,"From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the type.",6
26,All art is at once surface and symbol.,6
27,Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril.,6
28,Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.,6
29,"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.",6
30,"Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.",6
31,"When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.",6
32,We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it.,6
33,The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.,6
34,All art is quite useless.,7
35,OSCAR WILDE,8
36, CHAPTER I.,10
37," The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.",11
38,"From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.",12
39,"The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.",12
40,The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.,12
41,"In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.",13
42,"As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there.",14
43,"But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.",14
44,"“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said Lord Henry languidly.",15
45,“You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor.,15
46,The Academy is too large and too vulgar.,15
47,"Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.",15
48,The Grosvenor is really the only place.”,15
49,"“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford.",16
50,"“No, I won’t send it anywhere.”",16
51,"Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.",17
52,“Not send it anywhere?,17
53,"My dear fellow, why?",17
54,Have you any reason?,17
55,What odd chaps you painters are!,17
56,You do anything in the world to gain a reputation.,17
57,"As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.",17
58,"It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.",17
59,"A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.”",17
60,"“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit it.",18
61,I have put too much of myself into it.”,18
62,Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.,19
63,"“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”",20
64,“Too much of yourself in it!,21
65,"Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves.",21
66,"Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that.",21
67,"But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.",21
68,"Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.",21
69,"The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid.",21
70,Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.,21
71,How perfectly hideous they are!,21
72,"Except, of course, in the Church.",21
73,But then in the Church they don’t think.,21
74,"A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.",21
75,"Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.",21
76,I feel quite sure of that.,21
77,"He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.",21
78,"Don’t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”",21
79,"“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist.",22
80,“Of course I am not like him.,22
81,I know that perfectly well.,22
82,"Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him.",22
83,You shrug your shoulders?,22
84,I am telling you the truth.,22
85,"There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.",22
86,It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.,22
87,The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.,22
88,They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.,22
89,"If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.",22
90,"They live as we all should live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet.",22
91,"They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.",22
92,"Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”",22
93,“Dorian Gray?,23
94,"Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.",23
95,"“Yes, that is his name.",24
96,I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”,24
97,“But why not?”,25
98,"“Oh, I can’t explain.",26
99,"When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one.",26
100,It is like surrendering a part of them.,26
101,I have grown to love secrecy.,26
102,It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us.,26
103,The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.,26
104,When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going.,26
105,"If I did, I would lose all my pleasure.",26
106,"It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one’s life.",26
107,I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”,26
108,"“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil.",27
109,"You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.",27
110,"I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.",27
111,"When we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.",27
112,"My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact, than I am.",27
113,"She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do.",27
114,"But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all.",27
115,I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me.”,27
116,"“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.",28
117,"“I believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.",28
118,You are an extraordinary fellow.,28
119,"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.",28
120,Your cynicism is simply a pose.”,28
121,"“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,” cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.",29
122,The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves.,29
123,"In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.",29
124,"After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch.",30
125,"“I am afraid I must be going, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago.”",30
126,"“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.",31
127,“You know quite well.”,32
128,"“I do not, Harry.”",33
129,"“Well, I will tell you what it is.",34
130,I want you to explain to me why you won’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture.,34
131,I want the real reason.”,34
132,“I told you the real reason.”,35
133,"“No, you did not.",36
134,You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it.,36
135,"Now, that is childish.”",36
136,"“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.",37
137,"The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.",37
138,"It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.",37
139,The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.”,37
140,Lord Henry laughed.,38
141,“And what is that?” he asked.,38
142,"“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his face.",39
143,"“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at him.",40
144,"“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter; “and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.",41
145,Perhaps you will hardly believe it.”,41
146,"Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it.",42
147,"“I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, “and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.”",42
148,"The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air.",43
149,"A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings.",43
150,"Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating, and wondered what was coming.",43
151,"“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time.",44
152,“Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s.,44
153,"You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.",44
154,"With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.",44
155,"Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me.",44
156,I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.,44
157,"When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale.",44
158,A curious sensation of terror came over me.,44
159,"I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.",44
160,I did not want any external influence in my life.,44
161,"You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.",44
162,"I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.",44
163,Then—but I don’t know how to explain it to you.,44
164,Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.,44
165,I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.,44
166,I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.,44
167,It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice.,44
168,I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.”,44
169,"“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil.",45
170,Conscience is the trade-name of the firm.,45
171,That is all.”,45
172,"“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.",46
173,"However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door.",46
174,"There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon.",46
175,"‘You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out.",46
176,You know her curiously shrill voice?”,46
177,"“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.",47
178,“I could not get rid of her.,48
179,"She brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses.",48
180,She spoke of me as her dearest friend.,48
181,"I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me.",48
182,"I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.",48
183,Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me.,48
184,"We were quite close, almost touching.",48
185,Our eyes met again.,48
186,"It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.",48
187,"Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all.",48
188,It was simply inevitable.,48
189,We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.,48
190,I am sure of that.,48
191,Dorian told me so afterwards.,48
192,"He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other.”",48
193,“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his companion.,49
194,“I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her guests.,49
195,"I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding details.",49
196,I simply fled.,49
197,I like to find out people for myself.,49
198,But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods.,49
199,"She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know.”",49
200,“Poor Lady Brandon!,50
201,"You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward listlessly.",50
202,"“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in opening a restaurant.",51
203,How could I admire her?,51
204,"But tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”",51
205,"“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable.",52
206,"Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’ Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”",52
207,"“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.",53
208,Hallward shook his head.,54
209,"“You don’t understand what friendship is, Harry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter.",54
210,"You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”",54
211,"“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky.",55
212,“Yes; horribly unjust of you.,55
213,I make a great difference between people.,55
214,"I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.",55
215,A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.,55
216,I have not got one who is a fool.,55
217,"They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me.",55
218,Is that very vain of me?,55
219,I think it is rather vain.”,55
220,"“I should think it was, Harry.",56
221,But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.”,56
222,"“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”",57
223,“And much less than a friend.,58
224,"A sort of brother, I suppose?”",58
225,"“Oh, brothers!",59
226,I don’t care for brothers.,59
227,"My elder brother won’t die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”",59
228,"“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.",60
229,"“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious.",61
230,But I can’t help detesting my relations.,61
231,I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.,61
232,I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders.,61
233,"The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves.",61
234,"When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent.",61
235,And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly.”,61
236,"“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”",62
237,Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane.,63
238,“How English you are Basil!,63
239,That is the second time you have made that observation.,63
240,If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.,63
241,The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself.,63
242,"Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it.",63
243,"Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices.",63
244,"However, I don’t propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.",63
245,"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.",63
246,Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.,63
247,How often do you see him?”,63
248,“Every day.,64
249,I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day.,64
250,He is absolutely necessary to me.”,64
251,“How extraordinary!,65
252,I thought you would never care for anything but your art.”,65
253,"“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely.",66
254,"“I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world’s history.",66
255,"The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.",66
256,"What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me.",66
257,"It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him.",66
258,"Of course, I have done all that.",66
259,But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter.,66
260,"I won’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it.",66
261,"There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.",66
262,"But in some curious way—I wonder will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.",66
263,"I see things differently, I think of them differently.",66
264,I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before.,66
265,‘A dream of form in days of thought’—who is it who says that?,66
266,I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me.,66
267,"The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely visible presence—ah!",66
268,I wonder can you realize all that that means?,66
269,"Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.",66
270,The harmony of soul and body—how much that is!,66
271,"We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.",66
272,Harry!,66
273,if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me!,66
274,"You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?",66
275,It is one of the best things I have ever done.,66
276,And why is it so?,66
277,"Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.",66
278,"Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.”",66
279,"“Basil, this is extraordinary!",67
280,I must see Dorian Gray.”,67
281,Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden.,68
282,After some time he came back.,68
283,"“Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art.",68
284,You might see nothing in him.,68
285,I see everything in him.,68
286,He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.,68
287,"He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.",68
288,"I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours.",68
289,That is all.”,68
290,“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.,69
291,"“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to speak to him.",70
292,He knows nothing about it.,70
293,He shall never know anything about it.,70
294,"But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes.",70
295,My heart shall never be put under their microscope.,70
296,"There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too much of myself!”",70
297,“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.,71
298,They know how useful passion is for publication.,71
299,Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”,71
300,"“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward.",72
301,"“An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.",72
302,We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.,72
303,We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.,72
304,Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”,72
305,"“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you.",73
306,It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.,73
307,"Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?”",73
308,The painter considered for a few moments.,74
309,"“He likes me,” he answered after a pause; “I know he likes me.",74
310,Of course I flatter him dreadfully.,74
311,I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said.,74
312,"As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things.",74
313,"Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.",74
314,"Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”",74
315,"“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.",75
316,“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will.,75
317,"It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.",75
318,That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.,75
319,"In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.",75
320,The thoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal.,75
321,And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing.,75
322,"It is like a _bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.",75
323,"I think you will tire first, all the same.",75
324,"Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something.",75
325,"You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you.",75
326,"The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent.",75
327,"It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.",75
328,"What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.”",75
329,"“Harry, don’t talk like that.",76
330,"As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.",76
331,You can’t feel what I feel.,76
332,You change too often.”,76
333,"“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it.",77
334,"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase.",77
335,"There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.",77
336,How pleasant it was in the garden!,77
337,"And how delightful other people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him.",77
338,"One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those were the fascinating things in life.",77
339,He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.,77
340,"Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses.",77
341,"Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.",77
342,"The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.",77
343,It was charming to have escaped all that!,77
344,"As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him.",77
345,"He turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”",77
346,"“Remembered what, Harry?”",78
347,“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”,79
348,"“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.",80
349,"“Don’t look so angry, Basil.",81
350,"It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s.",81
351,"She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray.",81
352,I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking.,81
353,"Women have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not.",81
354,She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature.,81
355,"I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.",81
356,I wish I had known it was your friend.”,81
357,"“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”",82
358,“Why?”,83
359,“I don’t want you to meet him.”,84
360,“You don’t want me to meet him?”,85
361,“No.”,86
362,“Mr.,87
363,"Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into the garden.",87
364,"“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",88
365,"The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.",89
366,"“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man bowed and went up the walk.",89
367,Then he looked at Lord Henry.,90
368,"“Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he said.",90
369,“He has a simple and a beautiful nature.,90
370,Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him.,90
371,Don’t spoil him.,90
372,Don’t try to influence him.,90
373,Your influence would be bad.,90
374,"The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it.",90
375,Don’t take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him.,90
376,"Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.",90
377,"“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.",91
378, CHAPTER II.,93
379, As they entered they saw Dorian Gray.,94
380,"He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s “Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried.",94
381,“I want to learn them.,94
382,They are perfectly charming.”,94
383,"“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”",95
384,"“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner.",96
385,"When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up.",96
386,"“I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”",96
387,"“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.",97
388,"I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything.”",97
389,"“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand.",98
390,“My aunt has often spoken to me about you.,98
391,"You are one of her favourites, and, I am afraid, one of her victims also.”",98
392,"“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence.",99
393,"“I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.",99
394,"We were to have played a duet together—three duets, I believe.",99
395,I don’t know what she will say to me.,99
396,I am far too frightened to call.”,99
397,"“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt.",100
398,She is quite devoted to you.,100
399,And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there.,100
400,The audience probably thought it was a duet.,100
401,"When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”",100
402,"“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian, laughing.",101
403,Lord Henry looked at him.,102
404,"Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair.",102
405,There was something in his face that made one trust him at once.,102
406,"All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s passionate purity.",102
407,One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world.,102
408,No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.,102
409,"“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too charming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his cigarette-case.",103
410,The painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready.,104
411,"He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last remark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day.",104
412,Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”,104
413,Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.,105
414,"“Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he asked.",105
415,"“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry.",106
416,"I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks.",106
417,"Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”",106
418,"“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.",107
419,It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it.,107
420,"But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.",107
421,"You don’t really mind, Basil, do you?",107
422,You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to.”,107
423,Hallward bit his lip.,108
424,"“If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.",108
425,"Dorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”",108
426,Lord Henry took up his hat and gloves.,109
427,"“You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go.",109
428,I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans.,109
429,"Good-bye, Mr. Gray.",109
430,Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street.,109
431,I am nearly always at home at five o’clock.,109
432,Write to me when you are coming.,109
433,I should be sorry to miss you.”,109
434,"“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go, too.",110
435,"You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.",110
436,Ask him to stay.,110
437,I insist upon it.”,110
438,"“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward, gazing intently at his picture.",111
439,"“It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters.",111
440,I beg you to stay.”,111
441,“But what about my man at the Orleans?”,112
442,The painter laughed.,113
443,“I don’t think there will be any difficulty about that.,113
444,"Sit down again, Harry.",113
445,"And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says.",113
446,"He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception of myself.”",113
447,"Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather taken a fancy.",114
448,He was so unlike Basil.,114
449,They made a delightful contrast.,114
450,And he had such a beautiful voice.,114
451,"After a few moments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?",114
452,As bad as Basil says?”,114
453,"“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray.",115
454,All influence is immoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”,115
455,“Why?”,116
456,“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul.,117
457,"He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.",117
458,His virtues are not real to him.,117
459,"His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed.",117
460,"He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.",117
461,The aim of life is self-development.,117
462,To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each of us is here for.,117
463,"People are afraid of themselves, nowadays.",117
464,"They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self.",117
465,"Of course, they are charitable.",117
466,They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar.,117
467,"But their own souls starve, and are naked.",117
468,Courage has gone out of our race.,117
469,Perhaps we never really had it.,117
470,"The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion—these are the two things that govern us.",117
471,And yet—”,117
472,"“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.",118
473,"“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.",119
474,But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.,119
475,The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives.,119
476,We are punished for our refusals.,119
477,Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us.,119
478,"The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.",119
479,"Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.",119
480,The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.,119
481,"Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.",119
482,It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain.,119
483,"It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.",119
484,"You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”",119
485,"“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop!",120
486,you bewilder me.,120
487,I don’t know what to say.,120
488,"There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it.",120
489,Don’t speak.,120
490,Let me think.,120
491,"Or, rather, let me try not to think.”",120
492,"For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes strangely bright.",121
493,He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him.,121
494,Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself.,121
495,"The few words that Basil’s friend had said to him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.",121
496,Music had stirred him like that.,122
497,Music had troubled him many times.,122
498,But music was not articulate.,122
499,"It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us.",122
500,Words!,122
501,Mere words!,122
502,How terrible they were!,122
503,"How clear, and vivid, and cruel!",122
504,One could not escape from them.,122
505,And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!,122
506,"They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.",122
507,Mere words!,122
508,Was there anything so real as words?,122
509,Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.,123
510,He understood them now.,123
511,Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him.,123
512,It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire.,123
513,Why had he not known it?,123
514,"With his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him.",124
515,He knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing.,124
516,He felt intensely interested.,124
517,"He was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced, and, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.",124
518,He had merely shot an arrow into the air.,124
519,Had it hit the mark?,124
520,How fascinating the lad was!,124
521,"Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from strength.",125
522,He was unconscious of the silence.,125
523,"“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly.",126
524,“I must go out and sit in the garden.,126
525,The air is stifling here.”,126
526,"“My dear fellow, I am so sorry.",127
527,"When I am painting, I can’t think of anything else.",127
528,But you never sat better.,127
529,You were perfectly still.,127
530,And I have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes.,127
531,"I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression.",127
532,I suppose he has been paying you compliments.,127
533,You mustn’t believe a word that he says.”,127
534,“He has certainly not been paying me compliments.,128
535,Perhaps that is the reason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”,128
536,"“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes.",129
537,“I will go out to the garden with you.,129
538,It is horribly hot in the studio.,129
539,"Basil, let us have something iced to drink, something with strawberries in it.”",129
540,"“Certainly, Harry.",130
541,"Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want.",130
542,"I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on.",130
543,Don’t keep Dorian too long.,130
544,I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day.,130
545,This is going to be my masterpiece.,130
546,It is my masterpiece as it stands.”,130
547,"Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine.",131
548,He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder.,131
549,"“You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.",131
550,"“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.”",131
551,The lad started and drew back.,132
552,"He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.",132
553,"There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened.",132
554,"His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.",132
555,"“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.",133
556,You are a wonderful creation.,133
557,"You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”",133
558,Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.,134
559,"He could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him.",134
560,"His romantic, olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him.",134
561,There was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating.,134
562,"His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm.",134
563,"They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.",134
564,"But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.",134
565,Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself?,134
566,"He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him.",134
567,Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery.,134
568,"And, yet, what was there to be afraid of?",134
569,He was not a schoolboy or a girl.,134
570,It was absurd to be frightened.,134
571,"“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry.",135
572,"“Parker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.",135
573,You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt.,135
574,It would be unbecoming.”,135
575,"“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on the seat at the end of the garden.",136
576,"“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”",137
577,“Why?”,138
578,"“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.”",139
579,"“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”",140
580,"“No, you don’t feel it now.",141
581,"Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.",141
582,"Now, wherever you go, you charm the world.",141
583,Will it always be so?,141
584,"... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.",141
585,Don’t frown.,141
586,You have.,141
587,"And beauty is a form of genius—is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.",141
588,"It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.",141
589,It cannot be questioned.,141
590,It has its divine right of sovereignty.,141
591,It makes princes of those who have it.,141
592,You smile?,141
593,Ah!,141
594,when you have lost it you won’t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial.,141
595,"That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.",141
596,"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders.",141
597,It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.,141
598,"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible....",141
599,"Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.",141
600,But what the gods give they quickly take away.,141
601,"You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully.",141
602,"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.",141
603,Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful.,141
604,"Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.",141
605,"You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed.",141
606,You will suffer horribly.... Ah!,141
607,realize your youth while you have it.,141
608,"Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.",141
609,"These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age.",141
610,Live!,141
611,Live the wonderful life that is in you!,141
612,Let nothing be lost upon you.,141
613,Be always searching for new sensations.,141
614,Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.,141
615,You might be its visible symbol.,141
616,With your personality there is nothing you could not do.,141
617,The world belongs to you for a season....,141
618,"The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.",141
619,There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself.,141
620,I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.,141
621,For there is such a little time that your youth will last—such a little time.,141
622,"The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.",141
623,The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.,141
624,"In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.",141
625,But we never get back our youth.,141
626,The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish.,141
627,"Our limbs fail, our senses rot.",141
628,"We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.",141
629,Youth!,141
630,Youth!,141
631,There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”,141
632,"Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.",142
633,The spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel.,142
634,A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment.,142
635,Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms.,142
636,"He watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.",142
637,After a time the bee flew away.,142
638,He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus.,142
639,"The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.",142
640,Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in.,143
641,They turned to each other and smiled.,143
642,"“I am waiting,” he cried.",144
643,“Do come in.,144
644,"The light is quite perfect, and you can bring your drinks.”",144
645,They rose up and sauntered down the walk together.,145
646,"Two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.",145
647,"“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at him.",146
648,"“Yes, I am glad now.",147
649,I wonder shall I always be glad?”,147
650,“Always!,148
651,That is a dreadful word.,148
652,It makes me shudder when I hear it.,148
653,Women are so fond of using it.,148
654,They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever.,148
655,"It is a meaningless word, too.",148
656,The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.”,148
657,"As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s arm.",149
658,"“In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured, flushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose.",149
659,Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.,150
660,"The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance.",150
661,In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden.,150
662,The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.,150
663,"After about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning.",151
664,"“It is quite finished,” he cried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas.",151
665,Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.,152
666,"It was certainly a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.",152
667,"“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said.",153
668,“It is the finest portrait of modern times.,153
669,"Mr. Gray, come over and look at yourself.”",153
670,"The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.",154
671,"“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the platform.",155
672,"“Quite finished,” said the painter.",156
673,“And you have sat splendidly to-day.,156
674,I am awfully obliged to you.”,156
675,"“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry.",157
676,"“Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?”",157
677,"Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it.",158
678,"When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure.",158
679,"A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time.",158
680,"He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of his words.",158
681,The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation.,158
682,He had never felt it before.,158
683,Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship.,158
684,"He had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them.",158
685,They had not influenced his nature.,158
686,"Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity.",158
687,"That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him.",158
688,"Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed.",158
689,The scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair.,158
690,The life that was to make his soul would mar his body.,158
691,"He would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.",158
692,"As he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver.",159
693,"His eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears.",159
694,He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart.,159
695,"“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.",160
696,"“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry.",161
697,“Who wouldn’t like it?,161
698,It is one of the greatest things in modern art.,161
699,I will give you anything you like to ask for it.,161
700,I must have it.”,161
701,"“It is not my property, Harry.”",162
702,“Whose property is it?”,163
703,"“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.",164
704,“He is a very lucky fellow.”,165
705,“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait.,166
706,“How sad it is!,166
707,"I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful.",166
708,But this picture will remain always young.,166
709,It will never be older than this particular day of June....,166
710,If it were only the other way!,166
711,"If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!",166
712,For that—for that—I would give everything!,166
713,"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give!",166
714,I would give my soul for that!”,166
715,"“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",167
716,“It would be rather hard lines on your work.”,167
717,"“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.",168
718,Dorian Gray turned and looked at him.,169
719,"“I believe you would, Basil.",169
720,You like your art better than your friends.,169
721,I am no more to you than a green bronze figure.,169
722,"Hardly as much, I dare say.”",169
723,The painter stared in amazement.,170
724,It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that.,170
725,What had happened?,170
726,He seemed quite angry.,170
727,His face was flushed and his cheeks burning.,170
728,"“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun.",171
729,You will like them always.,171
730,How long will you like me?,171
731,"Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose.",171
732,"I know, now, that when one loses one’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.",171
733,Your picture has taught me that.,171
734,Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right.,171
735,Youth is the only thing worth having.,171
736,"When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself.”",171
737,Hallward turned pale and caught his hand.,172
738,“Dorian!,172
739,"Dorian!” he cried, “don’t talk like that.",172
740,"I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another.",172
741,"You are not jealous of material things, are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”",172
742,“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.,173
743,I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me.,173
744,Why should it keep what I must lose?,173
745,Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it.,173
746,"Oh, if it were only the other way!",173
747,"If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!",173
748,Why did you paint it?,173
749,"It will mock me some day—mock me horribly!” The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he was praying.",173
750,"“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.",174
751,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.,175
752,“It is the real Dorian Gray—that is all.”,175
753,“It is not.”,176
754,"“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”",177
755,"“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.",178
756,"“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.",179
757,"“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it.",180
758,What is it but canvas and colour?,180
759,I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them.”,180
760,"Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window.",181
761,What was he doing there?,181
762,"His fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.",181
763,"Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel.",181
764,He had found it at last.,181
765,He was going to rip up the canvas.,181
766,"With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.",182
767,"“Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried.",182
768,“It would be murder!”,182
769,"“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the painter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise.",183
770,“I never thought you would.”,183
771,“Appreciate it?,184
772,"I am in love with it, Basil.",184
773,It is part of myself.,184
774,I feel that.”,184
775,"“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home.",185
776,Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea.,185
777,"“You will have tea, of course, Dorian?",185
778,"And so will you, Harry?",185
779,Or do you object to such simple pleasures?”,185
780,"“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry.",186
781,“They are the last refuge of the complex.,186
782,"But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage.",186
783,"What absurd fellows you are, both of you!",186
784,I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal.,186
785,It was the most premature definition ever given.,186
786,"Man is many things, but he is not rational.",186
787,"I am glad he is not, after all—though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture.",186
788,"You had much better let me have it, Basil.",186
789,"This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I really do.”",186
790,"“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!” cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me a silly boy.”",187
791,"“You know the picture is yours, Dorian.",188
792,I gave it to you before it existed.”,188
793,"“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.”",189
794,"“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”",190
795,“Ah!,191
796,this morning!,191
797,You have lived since then.”,191
798,"There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.",192
799,There was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.,192
800,Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page.,192
801,Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea.,192
802,The two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers.,192
803,"“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry.",193
804,"“There is sure to be something on, somewhere.",193
805,"I have promised to dine at White’s, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement.",193
806,I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour.”,193
807,"“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered Hallward.",194
808,"“And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”",194
809,"“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable.",195
810,"It is so sombre, so depressing.",195
811,Sin is the only real colour-element left in modern life.”,195
812,"“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”",196
813,“Before which Dorian?,197
814,"The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one in the picture?”",197
815,“Before either.”,198
816,"“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said the lad.",199
817,"“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t you?”",200
818,"“I can’t, really.",201
819,I would sooner not.,201
820,I have a lot of work to do.”,201
821,"“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”",202
822,“I should like that awfully.”,203
823,"The painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture.",204
824,"“I shall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.",204
825,"“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait, strolling across to him.",205
826,“Am I really like that?”,205
827,“Yes; you are just like that.”,206
828,"“How wonderful, Basil!”",207
829,“At least you are like it in appearance.,208
830,"But it will never alter,” sighed Hallward.",208
831,“That is something.”,208
832,“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry.,209
833,"“Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology.",209
834,It has nothing to do with our own will.,209
835,"Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”",209
836,"“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward.",210
837,“Stop and dine with me.”,210
838,"“I can’t, Basil.”",211
839,“Why?”,212
840,“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”,213
841,“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises.,214
842,He always breaks his own.,214
843,I beg you not to go.”,214
844,Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.,215
845,“I entreat you.”,216
846,"The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.",217
847,"“I must go, Basil,” he answered.",218
848,"“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray.",219
849,"“It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had better lose no time.",219
850,"Good-bye, Harry.",219
851,"Good-bye, Dorian.",219
852,Come and see me soon.,219
853,Come to-morrow.”,219
854,“Certainly.”,220
855,“You won’t forget?”,221
856,"“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.",222
857,“And ... Harry!”,223
858,"“Yes, Basil?”",224
859,"“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning.”",225
860,“I have forgotten it.”,226
861,“I trust you.”,227
862,"“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing.",228
863,"“Come, Mr. Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own place.",228
864,"Good-bye, Basil.",228
865,It has been a most interesting afternoon.”,228
866,"As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, and a look of pain came into his face.",229
867, CHAPTER III.,231
868," At half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by Society as he fed the people who amused him.",232
869,"His father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and his inordinate passion for pleasure.",232
870,"The son, who had been his father’s secretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.",232
871,"He had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his meals at his club.",232
872,"He paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth.",232
873,"In politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals.",232
874,"He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he bullied in turn.",232
875,"Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.",232
876,"His principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices.",232
877,"When Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over _The Times_.",233
878,"“Well, Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out so early?",233
879,"I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five.”",233
880,"“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George.",234
881,I want to get something out of you.”,234
882,"“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face.",235
883,"“Well, sit down and tell me all about it.",235
884,"Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.”",235
885,"“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat; “and when they grow older they know it.",236
886,But I don’t want money.,236
887,"It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.",236
888,"Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it.",236
889,"Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me.",236
890,"What I want is information: not useful information, of course; useless information.”",236
891,"“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.",237
892,"When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better.",237
893,But I hear they let them in now by examination.,237
894,What can you expect?,237
895,"Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end.",237
896,"If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.”",237
897,“Mr.,238
898,"Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said Lord Henry languidly.",238
899,“Mr.,239
900,Dorian Gray?,239
901,"Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white eyebrows.",239
902,"“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George.",240
903,"Or rather, I know who he is.",240
904,He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson.,240
905,"His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.",240
906,I want you to tell me about his mother.,240
907,What was she like?,240
908,Whom did she marry?,240
909,"You have known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her.",240
910,I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present.,240
911,I have only just met him.”,240
912,“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman.,241
913,“Kelso’s grandson!,241
914,... Of course....,241
915,I knew his mother intimately.,241
916,I believe I was at her christening.,241
917,"She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind.",241
918,Certainly.,241
919,I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday.,241
920,The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage.,241
921,There was an ugly story about it.,241
922,"They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in public—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon.",241
923,"The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards.",241
924,"He brought his daughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again.",241
925,"Oh, yes; it was a bad business.",241
926,"The girl died, too, died within a year.",241
927,"So she left a son, did she?",241
928,I had forgotten that.,241
929,What sort of boy is he?,241
930,"If he is like his mother, he must be a good-looking chap.”",241
931,"“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.",242
932,"“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man.",243
933,“He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him.,243
934,"His mother had money, too.",243
935,"All the Selby property came to her, through her grandfather.",243
936,"Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog.",243
937,"He was, too.",243
938,Came to Madrid once when I was there.,243
939,"Egad, I was ashamed of him.",243
940,The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares.,243
941,They made quite a story of it.,243
942,I didn’t dare show my face at Court for a month.,243
943,I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies.”,243
944,"“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry.",244
945,“I fancy that the boy will be well off.,244
946,He is not of age yet.,244
947,"He has Selby, I know.",244
948,He told me so.,244
949,And ... his mother was very beautiful?”,244
950,"“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry.",245
951,"What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand.",245
952,She could have married anybody she chose.,245
953,Carlington was mad after her.,245
954,"She was romantic, though.",245
955,All the women of that family were.,245
956,"The men were a poor lot, but, egad!",245
957,the women were wonderful.,245
958,Carlington went on his knees to her.,245
959,Told me so himself.,245
960,"She laughed at him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at the time who wasn’t after him.",245
961,"And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?",245
962,Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”,245
963,"“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.”",246
964,"“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord Fermor, striking the table with his fist.",247
965,“The betting is on the Americans.”,248
966,"“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.",249
967,"“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase.",250
968,They take things flying.,250
969,I don’t think Dartmoor has a chance.”,250
970,“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman.,251
971,“Has she got any?”,251
972,Lord Henry shook his head.,252
973,"“American girls are as clever at concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said, rising to go.",252
974,"“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”",253
975,"“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake.",254
976,"I am told that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after politics.”",254
977,“Is she pretty?”,255
978,“She behaves as if she was beautiful.,256
979,Most American women do.,256
980,It is the secret of their charm.”,256
981,“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country?,257
982,They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women.”,257
983,“It is.,258
984,"That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of it,” said Lord Henry.",258
985,"“Good-bye, Uncle George.",258
986,"I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer.",258
987,Thanks for giving me the information I wanted.,258
988,"I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones.”",258
989,"“Where are you lunching, Harry?”",259
990,“At Aunt Agatha’s.,260
991,I have asked myself and Mr. Gray.,260
992,He is her latest _protégé_.”,260
993,“Humph!,261
994,"tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her charity appeals.",261
995,I am sick of them.,261
996,"Why, the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”",261
997,"“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have any effect.",262
998,Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.,262
999,It is their distinguishing characteristic.”,262
1000,The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant.,263
1001,Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.,263
1002,So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage.,264
1003,"Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance.",264
1004,A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion.,264
1005,"A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime.",264
1006,"Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain.",264
1007,"The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.",264
1008,Yes; it was an interesting background.,264
1009,"It posed the lad, made him more perfect, as it were.",264
1010,"Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.",264
1011,"Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.",264
1012,Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin.,264
1013,He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow....,264
1014,There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.,264
1015,No other activity was like it.,264
1016,"To project one’s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims....",264
1017,"He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.",264
1018,"Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us.",264
1019,There was nothing that one could not do with him.,264
1020,He could be made a Titan or a toy.,264
1021,What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade!,264
1022,... And Basil?,264
1023,"From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was!",264
1024,"The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was!",264
1025,He remembered something like it in history.,264
1026,"Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it?",264
1027,Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence?,264
1028,But in our own century it was strange....,264
1029,"Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait.",264
1030,"He would seek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done so.",264
1031,He would make that wonderful spirit his own.,264
1032,There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.,264
1033,Suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses.,265
1034,"He found that he had passed his aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.",265
1035,"When he entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch.",265
1036,He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.,265
1037,"“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.",266
1038,"He invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to her, looked round to see who was there.",267
1039,"Dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek.",267
1040,"Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her, and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness.",267
1041,"Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule.",267
1042,"The post on her left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was thirty.",267
1043,"His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt’s oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.",267
1044,"Fortunately for him she had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he remarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever quite escape.",267
1045,"“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the duchess, nodding pleasantly to him across the table.",268
1046,“Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person?”,268
1047,"“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”",269
1048,“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha.,270
1049,"“Really, some one should interfere.”",270
1050,"“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American dry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.",271
1051,"“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”",272
1052,“Dry-goods!,273
1053,"What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess, raising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.",273
1054,"“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail.",274
1055,The duchess looked puzzled.,275
1056,"“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha.",276
1057,“He never means anything that he says.”,276
1058,"“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he began to give some wearisome facts.",277
1059,"Like all people who try to exhaust a subject, he exhausted his listeners.",277
1060,The duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption.,277
1061,“I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all!” she exclaimed.,277
1062,"“Really, our girls have no chance nowadays.",277
1063,It is most unfair.”,277
1064,"“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr. Erskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”",278
1065,“Oh!,279
1066,"but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the duchess vaguely.",279
1067,“I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty.,279
1068,"And they dress well, too.",279
1069,They get all their dresses in Paris.,279
1070,I wish I could afford to do the same.”,279
1071,"“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.",280
1072,“Really!,281
1073,And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired the duchess.,281
1074,"“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.",282
1075,Sir Thomas frowned.,283
1076,"“I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country,” he said to Lady Agatha.",283
1077,"“I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil.",283
1078,I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”,283
1079,“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr. Erskine plaintively.,284
1080,“I don’t feel up to the journey.”,284
1081,Sir Thomas waved his hand.,285
1082,“Mr.,285
1083,Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves.,285
1084,"We practical men like to see things, not to read about them.",285
1085,The Americans are an extremely interesting people.,285
1086,They are absolutely reasonable.,285
1087,I think that is their distinguishing characteristic.,285
1088,"Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people.",285
1089,I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.”,285
1090,“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry.,286
1091,"“I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable.",286
1092,There is something unfair about its use.,286
1093,It is hitting below the intellect.”,286
1094,"“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.",287
1095,"“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.",288
1096,“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the baronet.,289
1097,“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine.,290
1098,“I did not think so.,290
1099,Perhaps it was.,290
1100,"Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth.",290
1101,To test reality we must see it on the tight rope.,290
1102,"When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.”",290
1103,"“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue!",291
1104,I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about.,291
1105,Oh!,291
1106,"Harry, I am quite vexed with you.",291
1107,Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End?,291
1108,I assure you he would be quite invaluable.,291
1109,They would love his playing.”,291
1110,"“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.",292
1111,"“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.",293
1112,"“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders.",294
1113,“I cannot sympathize with that.,294
1114,"It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.",294
1115,There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain.,294
1116,"One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.",294
1117,"The less said about life’s sores, the better.”",294
1118,"“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir Thomas with a grave shake of the head.",295
1119,"“Quite so,” answered the young lord.",296
1120,"“It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”",296
1121,The politician looked at him keenly.,297
1122,"“What change do you propose, then?” he asked.",297
1123,Lord Henry laughed.,298
1124,"“I don’t desire to change anything in England except the weather,” he answered.",298
1125,“I am quite content with philosophic contemplation.,298
1126,"But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.",298
1127,"The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.”",298
1128,"“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly.",299
1129,"“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.",300
1130,Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine.,301
1131,“Humanity takes itself too seriously.,301
1132,It is the world’s original sin.,301
1133,"If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different.”",301
1134,"“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess.",302
1135,"“I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.",302
1136,For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush.”,302
1137,"“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.",303
1138,"“Only when one is young,” she answered.",304
1139,"“When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign.",304
1140,Ah!,304
1141,"Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.”",304
1142,He thought for a moment.,305
1143,"“Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across the table.",305
1144,"“A great many, I fear,” she cried.",306
1145,"“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely.",307
1146,"“To get back one’s youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”",307
1147,“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed.,308
1148,“I must put it into practice.”,308
1149,“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips.,309
1150,"Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused.",309
1151,Mr. Erskine listened.,309
1152,"“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life.",310
1153,"Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one’s mistakes.”",310
1154,A laugh ran round the table.,311
1155,He played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox.,312
1156,"The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober.",312
1157,Facts fled before her like frightened forest things.,312
1158,"Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides.",312
1159,It was an extraordinary improvisation.,312
1160,"He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination.",312
1161,"He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible.",312
1162,"He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing.",312
1163,"Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.",312
1164,"At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting.",313
1165,She wrung her hands in mock despair.,313
1166,“How annoying!” she cried.,313
1167,“I must go.,313
1168,"I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair.",313
1169,"If I am late he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t have a scene in this bonnet.",313
1170,It is far too fragile.,313
1171,A harsh word would ruin it.,313
1172,"No, I must go, dear Agatha.",313
1173,"Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing.",313
1174,I am sure I don’t know what to say about your views.,313
1175,You must come and dine with us some night.,313
1176,Tuesday?,313
1177,Are you disengaged Tuesday?”,313
1178,"“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with a bow.",314
1179,“Ah!,315
1180,"that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried; “so mind you come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies.",315
1181,"When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair close to him, placed his hand upon his arm.",316
1182,"“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write one?”",317
1183,"“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.",318
1184,"I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal.",318
1185,"But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias.",318
1186,Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature.”,318
1187,"“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine.",319
1188,"“I myself used to have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.",319
1189,"And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?”",319
1190,"“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry.",320
1191,“Was it all very bad?”,320
1192,“Very bad indeed.,321
1193,"In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.",321
1194,But I should like to talk to you about life.,321
1195,The generation into which I was born was tedious.,321
1196,"Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess.”",321
1197,“I shall be charmed.,322
1198,A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege.,322
1199,"It has a perfect host, and a perfect library.”",322
1200,"“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow.",323
1201,“And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt.,323
1202,I am due at the Athenaeum.,323
1203,It is the hour when we sleep there.”,323
1204,"“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”",324
1205,"“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs.",325
1206,We are practising for an English Academy of Letters.”,325
1207,Lord Henry laughed and rose.,326
1208,"“I am going to the park,” he cried.",326
1209,"As he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.",327
1210,"“Let me come with you,” he murmured.",327
1211,"“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,” answered Lord Henry.",328
1212,"“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you.",329
1213,Do let me.,329
1214,And you will promise to talk to me all the time?,329
1215,No one talks so wonderfully as you do.”,329
1216,“Ah!,330
1217,"I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry, smiling.",330
1218,“All I want now is to look at life.,330
1219,"You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.”",330
1220, CHAPTER IV.,332
1221," One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair.",333
1222,"It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk, long-fringed Persian rugs.",333
1223,"On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device.",333
1224,"Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.",333
1225,Lord Henry had not yet come in.,334
1226,"He was always late on principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.",334
1227,"So the lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had found in one of the book-cases.",334
1228,The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him.,334
1229,Once or twice he thought of going away.,334
1230,"At last he heard a step outside, and the door opened.",335
1231,"“How late you are, Harry!” he murmured.",335
1232,"“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.",336
1233,He glanced quickly round and rose to his feet.,337
1234,“I beg your pardon.,337
1235,I thought—”,337
1236,“You thought it was my husband.,338
1237,It is only his wife.,338
1238,You must let me introduce myself.,338
1239,I know you quite well by your photographs.,338
1240,I think my husband has got seventeen of them.”,338
1241,"“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”",339
1242,"“Well, eighteen, then.",340
1243,"And I saw you with him the other night at the opera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her vague forget-me-not eyes.",340
1244,"She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.",340
1245,"She was usually in love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all her illusions.",340
1246,"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy.",340
1247,"Her name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.",340
1248,"“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”",341
1249,“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin.,342
1250,I like Wagner’s music better than anybody’s.,342
1251,It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says.,342
1252,"That is a great advantage, don’t you think so, Mr. Gray?”",342
1253,"The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.",343
1254,"Dorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so, Lady Henry.",344
1255,"I never talk during music—at least, during good music.",344
1256,"If one hears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”",344
1257,“Ah!,345
1258,"that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray?",345
1259,I always hear Harry’s views from his friends.,345
1260,It is the only way I get to know of them.,345
1261,But you must not think I don’t like good music.,345
1262,"I adore it, but I am afraid of it.",345
1263,It makes me too romantic.,345
1264,"I have simply worshipped pianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me.",345
1265,I don’t know what it is about them.,345
1266,Perhaps it is that they are foreigners.,345
1267,"They all are, ain’t they?",345
1268,"Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time, don’t they?",345
1269,"It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art.",345
1270,"Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it?",345
1271,"You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?",345
1272,You must come.,345
1273,"I can’t afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners.",345
1274,They make one’s rooms look so picturesque.,345
1275,But here is Harry!,345
1276,"Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray here.",345
1277,We have had such a pleasant chat about music.,345
1278,We have quite the same ideas.,345
1279,No; I think our ideas are quite different.,345
1280,But he has been most pleasant.,345
1281,I am so glad I’ve seen him.”,345
1282,"“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating his dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile.",346
1283,"“So sorry I am late, Dorian.",346
1284,I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it.,346
1285,Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.”,346
1286,"“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh.",347
1287,“I have promised to drive with the duchess.,347
1288,"Good-bye, Mr. Gray.",347
1289,"Good-bye, Harry.",347
1290,"You are dining out, I suppose?",347
1291,So am I.,347
1292,Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”,347
1293,"“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni.",348
1294,Then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa.,348
1295,"“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said after a few puffs.",349
1296,"“Why, Harry?”",350
1297,“Because they are so sentimental.”,351
1298,“But I like sentimental people.”,352
1299,"“Never marry at all, Dorian.",353
1300,"Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.”",353
1301,"“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry.",354
1302,I am too much in love.,354
1303,That is one of your aphorisms.,354
1304,"I am putting it into practice, as I do everything that you say.”",354
1305,“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.,355
1306,"“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.",356
1307,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.,357
1308,“That is a rather commonplace _début_.”,357
1309,"“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”",358
1310,“Who is she?”,359
1311,“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”,360
1312,“Never heard of her.”,361
1313,“No one has.,362
1314,"People will some day, however.",362
1315,She is a genius.”,362
1316,"“My dear boy, no woman is a genius.",363
1317,Women are a decorative sex.,363
1318,"They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.",363
1319,"Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.”",363
1320,"“Harry, how can you?”",364
1321,"“My dear Dorian, it is quite true.",365
1322,"I am analysing women at present, so I ought to know.",365
1323,The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was.,365
1324,"I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured.",365
1325,The plain women are very useful.,365
1326,"If you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to supper.",365
1327,The other women are very charming.,365
1328,"They commit one mistake, however.",365
1329,They paint in order to try and look young.,365
1330,Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.,365
1331,_Rouge_ and _esprit_ used to go together.,365
1332,That is all over now.,365
1333,"As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is perfectly satisfied.",365
1334,"As for conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of these can’t be admitted into decent society.",365
1335,"However, tell me about your genius.",365
1336,How long have you known her?”,365
1337,“Ah!,366
1338,"Harry, your views terrify me.”",366
1339,“Never mind that.,367
1340,How long have you known her?”,367
1341,“About three weeks.”,368
1342,“And where did you come across her?”,369
1343,"“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.",370
1344,"After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you.",370
1345,You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.,370
1346,"For days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins.",370
1347,"As I lounged in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they led.",370
1348,Some of them fascinated me.,370
1349,Others filled me with terror.,370
1350,There was an exquisite poison in the air.,370
1351,"I had a passion for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I determined to go out in search of some adventure.",370
1352,"I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.",370
1353,I fancied a thousand things.,370
1354,The mere danger gave me a sense of delight.,370
1355,"I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret of life.",370
1356,"I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares.",370
1357,"About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.",370
1358,"A hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.",370
1359,"He had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt.",370
1360,"‘Have a box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility.",370
1361,"There was something about him, Harry, that amused me.",370
1362,He was such a monster.,370
1363,"You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box.",370
1364,"To the present day I can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear Harry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my life.",370
1365,I see you are laughing.,370
1366,It is horrid of you!”,370
1367,"“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.",371
1368,But you should not say the greatest romance of your life.,371
1369,You should say the first romance of your life.,371
1370,"You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love.",371
1371,A _grande passion_ is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.,371
1372,That is the one use of the idle classes of a country.,371
1373,Don’t be afraid.,371
1374,There are exquisite things in store for you.,371
1375,This is merely the beginning.”,371
1376,“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.,372
1377,“No; I think your nature so deep.”,373
1378,“How do you mean?”,374
1379,"“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people.",375
1380,"What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination.",375
1381,Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect—simply a confession of failure.,375
1382,Faithfulness!,375
1383,I must analyse it some day.,375
1384,The passion for property is in it.,375
1385,There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.,375
1386,But I don’t want to interrupt you.,375
1387,Go on with your story.”,375
1388,"“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.",376
1389,I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house.,376
1390,"It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake.",376
1391,"The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress-circle.",376
1392,"Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”",376
1393,“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”,377
1394,"“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing.",378
1395,I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill.,378
1396,"What do you think the play was, Harry?”",378
1397,"“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but Innocent’.",379
1398,"Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe.",379
1399,"The longer I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us.",379
1400,"In art, as in politics, _les grandpères ont toujours tort_.”",379
1401,"“This play was good enough for us, Harry.",380
1402,It was Romeo and Juliet.,380
1403,I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place.,380
1404,"Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way.",380
1405,"At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.",380
1406,"There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began.",380
1407,"Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel.",380
1408,Mercutio was almost as bad.,380
1409,"He was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit.",380
1410,"They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth.",380
1411,But Juliet!,380
1412,"Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.",380
1413,She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life.,380
1414,"You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.",380
1415,"I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me.",380
1416,And her voice—I never heard such a voice.,380
1417,"It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s ear.",380
1418,"Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy.",380
1419,In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.,380
1420,"There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins.",380
1421,You know how a voice can stir one.,380
1422,Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget.,380
1423,"When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different.",380
1424,I don’t know which to follow.,380
1425,Why should I not love her?,380
1426,"Harry, I do love her.",380
1427,She is everything to me in life.,380
1428,Night after night I go to see her play.,380
1429,"One evening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen.",380
1430,"I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover’s lips.",380
1431,"I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.",380
1432,"She has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of.",380
1433,"She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat.",380
1434,I have seen her in every age and in every costume.,380
1435,Ordinary women never appeal to one’s imagination.,380
1436,They are limited to their century.,380
1437,No glamour ever transfigures them.,380
1438,One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets.,380
1439,One can always find them.,380
1440,There is no mystery in any of them.,380
1441,They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.,380
1442,They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner.,380
1443,They are quite obvious.,380
1444,But an actress!,380
1445,How different an actress is!,380
1446,Harry!,380
1447,why didn’t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”,380
1448,"“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”",381
1449,"“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”",382
1450,“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces.,383
1451,"There is an extraordinary charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.",383
1452,“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”,384
1453,"“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian.",385
1454,All through your life you will tell me everything you do.”,385
1455,"“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true.",386
1456,I cannot help telling you things.,386
1457,You have a curious influence over me.,386
1458,"If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you.",386
1459,You would understand me.”,386
1460,"“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t commit crimes, Dorian.",387
1461,"But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.",387
1462,"And now tell me—reach me the matches, like a good boy—thanks—what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”",387
1463,"Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.",388
1464,“Harry!,388
1465,Sibyl Vane is sacred!”,388
1466,"“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice.",389
1467,“But why should you be annoyed?,389
1468,I suppose she will belong to you some day.,389
1469,"When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one always ends by deceiving others.",389
1470,That is what the world calls a romance.,389
1471,"You know her, at any rate, I suppose?”",389
1472,“Of course I know her.,390
1473,"On the first night I was at the theatre, the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her.",390
1474,"I was furious with him, and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.",390
1475,"I think, from his blank look of amazement, that he was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.”",390
1476,“I am not surprised.”,391
1477,“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers.,392
1478,I told him I never even read them.,392
1479,"He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that they were every one of them to be bought.”",392
1480,“I should not wonder if he was quite right there.,393
1481,"But, on the other hand, judging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all expensive.”",393
1482,"“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed Dorian.",394
1483,"“By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go.",394
1484,He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended.,394
1485,I declined.,394
1486,"The next night, of course, I arrived at the place again.",394
1487,"When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art.",394
1488,"He was a most offensive brute, though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare.",394
1489,"He told me once, with an air of pride, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The Bard,’ as he insisted on calling him.",394
1490,He seemed to think it a distinction.”,394
1491,"“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction.",395
1492,Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life.,395
1493,To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour.,395
1494,But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”,395
1495,“The third night.,396
1496,She had been playing Rosalind.,396
1497,I could not help going round.,396
1498,"I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me—at least I fancied that she had.",396
1499,The old Jew was persistent.,396
1500,"He seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented.",396
1501,"It was curious my not wanting to know her, wasn’t it?”",396
1502,“No; I don’t think so.”,397
1503,"“My dear Harry, why?”",398
1504,“I will tell you some other time.,399
1505,Now I want to know about the girl.”,399
1506,“Sibyl?,400
1507,"Oh, she was so shy and so gentle.",400
1508,There is something of a child about her.,400
1509,"Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power.",400
1510,I think we were both rather nervous.,400
1511,"The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood looking at each other like children.",400
1512,"He would insist on calling me ‘My Lord,’ so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.",400
1513,"She said quite simply to me, ‘You look more like a prince.",400
1514,I must call you Prince Charming.’”,400
1515,"“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”",401
1516,"“You don’t understand her, Harry.",402
1517,She regarded me merely as a person in a play.,402
1518,She knows nothing of life.,402
1519,"She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen better days.”",402
1520,“I know that look.,403
1521,"It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining his rings.",403
1522,"“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest me.”",404
1523,“You were quite right.,405
1524,There is always something infinitely mean about other people’s tragedies.”,405
1525,“Sibyl is the only thing I care about.,406
1526,What is it to me where she came from?,406
1527,"From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine.",406
1528,"Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every night she is more marvellous.”",406
1529,"“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now.",407
1530,I thought you must have some curious romance on hand.,407
1531,You have; but it is not quite what I expected.”,407
1532,"“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have been to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his blue eyes in wonder.",408
1533,“You always come dreadfully late.”,409
1534,"“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried, “even if it is only for a single act.",410
1535,"I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, I am filled with awe.”",410
1536,"“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”",411
1537,He shook his head.,412
1538,"“To-night she is Imogen,” he answered, “and to-morrow night she will be Juliet.”",412
1539,“When is she Sibyl Vane?”,413
1540,“Never.”,414
1541,“I congratulate you.”,415
1542,“How horrid you are!,416
1543,She is all the great heroines of the world in one.,416
1544,She is more than an individual.,416
1545,"You laugh, but I tell you she has genius.",416
1546,"I love her, and I must make her love me.",416
1547,"You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me!",416
1548,I want to make Romeo jealous.,416
1549,I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad.,416

1551,"My God, Harry, how I worship her!” He was walking up and down the room as he spoke.",416
1552,Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks.,416
1553,He was terribly excited.,416
1554,Lord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure.,417
1555,How different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s studio!,417
1556,"His nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame.",417
1557,"Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way.",417
1558,“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.,418
1559,“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act.,419
1560,I have not the slightest fear of the result.,419
1561,You are certain to acknowledge her genius.,419
1562,Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands.,419
1563,She is bound to him for three years—at least for two years and eight months—from the present time.,419
1564,"I shall have to pay him something, of course.",419
1565,"When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly.",419

1567,"“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”",420
1568,"“Yes, she will.",421
1569,"She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in her, but she has personality also; and you have often told me that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age.”",421
1570,"“Well, what night shall we go?”",422
1571,“Let me see.,423
1572,To-day is Tuesday.,423
1573,Let us fix to-morrow.,423
1574,She plays Juliet to-morrow.”,423
1575,“All right.,424
1576,The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get Basil.”,424
1577,"“Not eight, Harry, please.",425
1578,Half-past six.,425
1579,We must be there before the curtain rises.,425
1580,"You must see her in the first act, where she meets Romeo.”",425
1581,“Half-past six!,426
1582,What an hour!,426
1583,"It will be like having a meat-tea, or reading an English novel.",426
1584,It must be seven.,426
1585,No gentleman dines before seven.,426
1586,Shall you see Basil between this and then?,426
1587,Or shall I write to him?”,426
1588,“Dear Basil!,427
1589,I have not laid eyes on him for a week.,427
1590,"It is rather horrid of me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I delight in it.",427
1591,Perhaps you had better write to him.,427
1592,I don’t want to see him alone.,427
1593,He says things that annoy me.,427
1594,He gives me good advice.”,427
1595,Lord Henry smiled.,428
1596,“People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves.,428
1597,It is what I call the depth of generosity.”,428
1598,"“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine.",429
1599,"Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.”",429
1600,"“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his work.",430
1601,"The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices, his principles, and his common sense.",430
1602,The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.,430
1603,"Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are.",430
1604,"A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.",430
1605,But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating.,430
1606,"The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look.",430
1607,The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.,430
1608,He lives the poetry that he cannot write.,430
1609,The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”,430
1610,"“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on the table.",431
1611,"“It must be, if you say it.",431
1612,And now I am off.,431
1613,Imogen is waiting for me.,431
1614,Don’t forget about to-morrow.,431
1615,Good-bye.”,431
1616,"As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think.",432
1617,"Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.",432
1618,He was pleased by it.,432
1619,It made him a more interesting study.,432
1620,"He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import.",432
1621,"And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others.",432
1622,Human life—that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating.,432
1623,Compared to it there was nothing else of any value.,432
1624,"It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.",432
1625,There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them.,432
1626,There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature.,432
1627,"And, yet, what a great reward one received!",432
1628,How wonderful the whole world became to one!,432
1629,"To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord—there was a delight in that!",432
1630,What matter what the cost was?,432
1631,One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.,432
1632,"He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her.",433
1633,To a large extent the lad was his own creation.,433
1634,He had made him premature.,433
1635,That was something.,433
1636,"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.",433
1637,"Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect.",433
1638,"But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.",433
1639,"Yes, the lad was premature.",434
1640,He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring.,434
1641,"The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious.",434
1642,It was delightful to watch him.,434
1643,"With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at.",434
1644,"It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end.",434
1645,"He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.",434
1646,"Soul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were!",435
1647,"There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.",435
1648,"The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.",435
1649,"Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began?",435
1650,How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!,435
1651,And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools!,435
1652,Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?,435
1653,"Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?",435
1654,"The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.",435
1655,He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.,436
1656,"As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others.",436
1657,Experience was of no ethical value.,436
1658,It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.,436
1659,"Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid.",436
1660,But there was no motive power in experience.,436
1661,It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself.,436
1662,"All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.",436
1663,"It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results.",437
1664,His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.,437
1665,"There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex passion.",437
1666,"What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.",437
1667,It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us.,437
1668,Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious.,437
1669,It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.,437
1670,"While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner.",438
1671,He got up and looked out into the street.,438
1672,The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite.,438
1673,The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.,438
1674,The sky above was like a faded rose.,438
1675,He thought of his friend’s young fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end.,438
1676,"When he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram lying on the hall table.",439
1677,He opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray.,439
1678,It was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.,439
1679, CHAPTER V.,441
1680," “Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained.",442
1681,"“I am so happy!” she repeated, “and you must be happy, too!”",442
1682,"Mrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her daughter’s head.",443
1683,"“Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you act.",443
1684,You must not think of anything but your acting.,443
1685,"Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.”",443
1686,The girl looked up and pouted.,444
1687,"“Money, Mother?” she cried, “what does money matter?",444
1688,Love is more than money.”,444
1689,“Mr.,445
1690,Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James.,445
1691,"You must not forget that, Sibyl.",445
1692,Fifty pounds is a very large sum.,445
1693,Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”,445
1694,"“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,” said the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.",446
1695,"“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the elder woman querulously.",447
1696,Sibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed.,448
1697,"“We don’t want him any more, Mother.",448
1698,Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused.,448
1699,A rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks.,448
1700,Quick breath parted the petals of her lips.,448
1701,They trembled.,448
1702,Some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress.,448
1703,"“I love him,” she said simply.",448
1704,“Foolish child!,449
1705,foolish child!” was the parrot-phrase flung in answer.,449
1706,"The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the words.",449
1707,The girl laughed again.,450
1708,The joy of a caged bird was in her voice.,450
1709,"Her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret.",450
1710,"When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.",450
1711,"Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense.",451
1712,She did not listen.,451
1713,She was free in her prison of passion.,451
1714,"Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.",451
1715,She had called on memory to remake him.,451
1716,"She had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back.",451
1717,His kiss burned again upon her mouth.,451
1718,Her eyelids were warm with his breath.,451
1719,Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery.,452
1720,This young man might be rich.,452
1721,"If so, marriage should be thought of.",452
1722,Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning.,452
1723,The arrows of craft shot by her.,452
1724,"She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.",452
1725,Suddenly she felt the need to speak.,453
1726,The wordy silence troubled her.,453
1727,"“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much?",453
1728,I know why I love him.,453
1729,I love him because he is like what love himself should be.,453
1730,But what does he see in me?,453
1731,I am not worthy of him.,453
1732,"And yet—why, I cannot tell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble.",453
1733,"I feel proud, terribly proud.",453
1734,"Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince Charming?”",453
1735,"The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.",454
1736,"Sybil rushed to her, flung her arms round her neck, and kissed her.",454
1737,"“Forgive me, Mother.",454
1738,I know it pains you to talk about our father.,454
1739,But it only pains you because you loved him so much.,454
1740,Don’t look so sad.,454
1741,I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago.,454
1742,Ah!,454
1743,let me be happy for ever!”,454
1744,"“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love.",455
1745,"Besides, what do you know of this young man?",455
1746,You don’t even know his name.,455
1747,"The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you should have shown more consideration.",455
1748,"However, as I said before, if he is rich ...”",455
1749,“Ah!,456
1750,"Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”",456
1751,"Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her arms.",457
1752,"At this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room.",457
1753,"He was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement.",457
1754,He was not so finely bred as his sister.,457
1755,One would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.,457
1756,Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile.,457
1757,She mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience.,457
1758,She felt sure that the _tableau_ was interesting.,457
1759,"“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said the lad with a good-natured grumble.",458
1760,“Ah!,459
1761,"but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried.",459
1762,“You are a dreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and hugged him.,459
1763,James Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness.,460
1764,"“I want you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.",460
1765,I don’t suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again.,460
1766,I am sure I don’t want to.”,460
1767,"“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.",461
1768,She felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group.,461
1769,It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.,461
1770,"“Why not, Mother?",462
1771,I mean it.”,462
1772,"“You pain me, my son.",463
1773,I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence.,463
1774,"I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”",463
1775,“Society!” muttered the lad.,464
1776,“I don’t want to know anything about that.,464
1777,I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage.,464
1778,I hate it.”,464
1779,"“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you!",465
1780,But are you really going for a walk with me?,465
1781,That will be nice!,465
1782,"I was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking it.",465
1783,It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon.,465
1784,Where shall we go?,465
1785,Let us go to the park.”,465
1786,"“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning.",466
1787,“Only swell people go to the park.”,466
1788,"“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.",467
1789,He hesitated for a moment.,468
1790,"“Very well,” he said at last, “but don’t be too long dressing.” She danced out of the door.",468
1791,One could hear her singing as she ran upstairs.,468
1792,Her little feet pattered overhead.,468
1793,He walked up and down the room two or three times.,469
1794,Then he turned to the still figure in the chair.,469
1795,"“Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.",469
1796,"“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.",470
1797,For some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers.,470
1798,Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met.,470
1799,She used to wonder if he suspected anything.,470
1800,"The silence, for he made no other observation, became intolerable to her.",470
1801,She began to complain.,470
1802,"Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders.",470
1803,"“I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life,” she said.",470
1804,“You must remember that it is your own choice.,470
1805,You might have entered a solicitor’s office.,470
1806,"Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families.”",470
1807,"“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied.",471
1808,“But you are quite right.,471
1809,I have chosen my own life.,471
1810,"All I say is, watch over Sibyl.",471
1811,Don’t let her come to any harm.,471
1812,"Mother, you must watch over her.”",471
1813,"“James, you really talk very strangely.",472
1814,Of course I watch over Sibyl.”,472
1815,“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her.,473
1816,Is that right?,473
1817,What about that?”,473
1818,"“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James.",474
1819,In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention.,474
1820,I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time.,474
1821,That was when acting was really understood.,474
1822,"As for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not.",474
1823,But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman.,474
1824,He is always most polite to me.,474
1825,"Besides, he has the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.”",474
1826,"“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.",475
1827,"“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.",476
1828,“He has not yet revealed his real name.,476
1829,I think it is quite romantic of him.,476
1830,He is probably a member of the aristocracy.”,476
1831,James Vane bit his lip.,477
1832,"“Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried, “watch over her.”",477
1833,"“My son, you distress me very much.",478
1834,Sibyl is always under my special care.,478
1835,"Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him.",478
1836,I trust he is one of the aristocracy.,478
1837,"He has all the appearance of it, I must say.",478
1838,It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl.,478
1839,They would make a charming couple.,478
1840,His good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”,478
1841,The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his coarse fingers.,479
1842,He had just turned round to say something when the door opened and Sibyl ran in.,479
1843,“How serious you both are!” she cried.,480
1844,“What is the matter?”,480
1845,"“Nothing,” he answered.",481
1846,“I suppose one must be serious sometimes.,481
1847,"Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock.",481
1848,"Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”",481
1849,"“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained stateliness.",482
1850,"She was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and there was something in his look that had made her feel afraid.",483
1851,"“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl.",484
1852,Her flowerlike lips touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost.,484
1853,“My child!,485
1854,"my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery.",485
1855,"“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently.",486
1856,He hated his mother’s affectations.,486
1857,"They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary Euston Road.",487
1858,"The passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.",487
1859,He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.,487
1860,Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger.,488
1861,"He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.",488
1862,"Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing.",488
1863,Her love was trembling in laughter on her lips.,488
1864,"She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all the more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers.",488
1865,"For he was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.",488
1866,"Oh, no!",488
1867,A sailor’s existence was dreadful.,488
1868,"Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!",488
1869,"He was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.",488
1870,"Before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen.",488
1871,"The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter.",488
1872,"Or, no.",488
1873,He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.,488
1874,"They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language.",488
1875,"He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her.",488
1876,"Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.",488
1877,"Yes, there were delightful things in store for him.",488
1878,"But he must be very good, and not lose his temper, or spend his money foolishly.",488
1879,"She was only a year older than he was, but she knew so much more of life.",488
1880,"He must be sure, also, to write to her by every mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep.",488
1881,"God was very good, and would watch over him.",488
1882,"She would pray for him, too, and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy.",488
1883,The lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer.,489
1884,He was heart-sick at leaving home.,489
1885,Yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose.,490
1886,"Inexperienced though he was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl’s position.",490
1887,This young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good.,490
1888,"He was a gentleman, and he hated him for that, hated him through some curious race-instinct for which he could not account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him.",490
1889,"He was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mother’s nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl’s happiness.",490
1890,Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.,490
1891,His mother!,491
1892,"He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that he had brooded on for many months of silence.",491
1893,"A chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of horrible thoughts.",491
1894,He remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face.,491
1895,"His brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip.",491
1896,"“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl, “and I am making the most delightful plans for your future.",492
1897,Do say something.”,492
1898,“What do you want me to say?”,493
1899,“Oh!,494
1900,"that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered, smiling at him.",494
1901,He shrugged his shoulders.,495
1902,"“You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, Sibyl.”",495
1903,She flushed.,496
1904,"“What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.",496
1905,"“You have a new friend, I hear.",497
1906,Who is he?,497
1907,Why have you not told me about him?,497
1908,He means you no good.”,497
1909,"“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed.",498
1910,“You must not say anything against him.,498
1911,I love him.”,498
1912,"“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad.",499
1913,“Who is he?,499
1914,I have a right to know.”,499
1915,“He is called Prince Charming.,500
1916,Don’t you like the name?,500
1917,Oh!,500
1918,you silly boy!,500
1919,you should never forget it.,500
1920,"If you only saw him, you would think him the most wonderful person in the world.",500
1921,Some day you will meet him—when you come back from Australia.,500
1922,You will like him so much.,500
1923,"Everybody likes him, and I ... love him.",500
1924,I wish you could come to the theatre to-night.,500
1925,"He is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.",500
1926,Oh!,500
1927,how I shall play it!,500
1928,"Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet!",500
1929,To have him sitting there!,500
1930,To play for his delight!,500
1931,"I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them.",500
1932,To be in love is to surpass one’s self.,500
1933,Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting ‘genius’ to his loafers at the bar.,500
1934,He has preached me as a dogma; to-night he will announce me as a revelation.,500
1935,I feel it.,500
1936,"And it is all his, his only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces.",500
1937,But I am poor beside him.,500
1938,Poor?,500
1939,What does that matter?,500
1940,"When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window.",500
1941,Our proverbs want rewriting.,500
1942,"They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.”",500
1943,"“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.",501
1944,“A prince!” she cried musically.,502
1945,“What more do you want?”,502

1951,She laughed and took his arm.,508

1960,Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by.”,508
1961,They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers.,509
1962,The tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire.,509
1963,A white dust—tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air.,509
1964,The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.,509
1965,"She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects.",510
1966,He spoke slowly and with effort.,510
1967,They passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters.,510
1968,Sibyl felt oppressed.,510
1969,She could not communicate her joy.,510
1970,A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win.,510
1971,After some time she became silent.,510
1972,"Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.",510
1973,She started to her feet.,511
1974,“There he is!” she cried.,511
1975,“Who?” said Jim Vane.,512
1976,"“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.",513
1977,He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm.,514
1978,“Show him to me.,514
1979,Which is he?,514
1980,Point him out.,514
1981,"I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment the Duke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.",514
1982,"“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly.",515
1983,“I wish you had seen him.”,515
1984,"“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him.”",516
1985,She looked at him in horror.,517
1986,He repeated his words.,517
1987,They cut the air like a dagger.,517
1988,The people round began to gape.,517
1989,A lady standing close to her tittered.,517
1990,"“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered.",518
1991,He followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd.,518
1992,He felt glad at what he had said.,518
1993,"When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round.",519
1994,There was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips.,519
1995,She shook her head at him.,519
1996,"“You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all.",519
1997,How can you say such horrible things?,519
1998,You don’t know what you are talking about.,519
1999,You are simply jealous and unkind.,519
2000,Ah!,519
2001,I wish you would fall in love.,519
2002,"Love makes people good, and what you said was wicked.”",519
2003,"“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about.",520
2004,Mother is no help to you.,520
2005,She doesn’t understand how to look after you.,520
2006,I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all.,520
2007,I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up.,520
2008,"I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”",520
2009,"“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim.",521
2010,You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in.,521
2011,I am not going to quarrel with you.,521
2012,"I have seen him, and oh!",521
2013,to see him is perfect happiness.,521
2014,We won’t quarrel.,521
2015,"I know you would never harm any one I love, would you?”",521
2016,"“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.",522
2017,“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.,523
2018,“And he?”,524
2019,"“For ever, too!”",525
2020,“He had better.”,526
2021,She shrank from him.,527
2022,Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.,527
2023,He was merely a boy.,527
2024,"At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their shabby home in the Euston Road.",528
2025,"It was after five o’clock, and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting.",528
2026,Jim insisted that she should do so.,528
2027,He said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present.,528
2028,"She would be sure to make a scene, and he detested scenes of every kind.",528
2029,In Sybil’s own room they parted.,529
2030,"There was jealousy in the lad’s heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him, had come between them.",529
2031,"Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her fingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her with real affection.",529
2032,There were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs.,529
2033,His mother was waiting for him below.,530
2034,"She grumbled at his unpunctuality, as he entered.",530
2035,"He made no answer, but sat down to his meagre meal.",530
2036,The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth.,530
2037,"Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him.",530
2038,"After some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands.",531
2039,He felt that he had a right to know.,531
2040,"It should have been told to him before, if it was as he suspected.",531
2041,"Leaden with fear, his mother watched him.",531
2042,Words dropped mechanically from her lips.,531
2043,A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers.,531
2044,"When the clock struck six, he got up and went to the door.",531
2045,Then he turned back and looked at her.,531
2046,Their eyes met.,531
2047,In hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy.,531
2048,It enraged him.,531
2049,"“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said.",532
2050,Her eyes wandered vaguely about the room.,532
2051,She made no answer.,532
2052,“Tell me the truth.,532
2053,I have a right to know.,532
2054,Were you married to my father?”,532
2055,She heaved a deep sigh.,533
2056,It was a sigh of relief.,533
2057,"The terrible moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she felt no terror.",533
2058,"Indeed, in some measure it was a disappointment to her.",533
2059,The vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer.,533
2060,The situation had not been gradually led up to.,533
2061,It was crude.,533
2062,It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.,533
2063,"“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.",534
2064,"“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his fists.",535
2065,She shook her head.,536
2066,“I knew he was not free.,536
2067,We loved each other very much.,536
2068,"If he had lived, he would have made provision for us.",536
2069,"Don’t speak against him, my son.",536
2070,"He was your father, and a gentleman.",536
2071,"Indeed, he was highly connected.”",536
2072,An oath broke from his lips.,537
2073,"“I don’t care for myself,” he exclaimed, “but don’t let Sibyl....",537
2074,"It is a gentleman, isn’t it, who is in love with her, or says he is?",537
2075,"Highly connected, too, I suppose.”",537
2076,For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman.,538
2077,Her head drooped.,538
2078,She wiped her eyes with shaking hands.,538
2079,"“Sibyl has a mother,” she murmured; “I had none.”",538
2080,The lad was touched.,539
2081,"He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed her.",539
2082,"“I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he said, “but I could not help it.",539
2083,I must go now.,539
2084,Good-bye.,539
2085,"Don’t forget that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog.",539
2086,I swear it.”,539
2087,"The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her.",540
2088,She was familiar with the atmosphere.,540
2089,"She breathed more freely, and for the first time for many months she really admired her son.",540
2090,"She would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short.",540
2091,Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for.,540
2092,The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out.,540
2093,There was the bargaining with the cabman.,540
2094,The moment was lost in vulgar details.,540
2095,"It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove away.",540
2096,She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted.,540
2097,"She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she had only one child to look after.",540
2098,She remembered the phrase.,540
2099,It had pleased her.,540
2100,Of the threat she said nothing.,540
2101,It was vividly and dramatically expressed.,540
2102,She felt that they would all laugh at it some day.,540
2103, CHAPTER VI.,542
2104," “I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.",543
2105,"“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter.",544
2106,“What is it?,544
2107,"Nothing about politics, I hope!",544
2108,They don’t interest me.,544
2109,"There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing.”",544
2110,"“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching him as he spoke.",545
2111,Hallward started and then frowned.,546
2112,“Dorian engaged to be married!” he cried.,546
2113,“Impossible!”,546
2114,“It is perfectly true.”,547
2115,“To whom?”,548
2116,“To some little actress or other.”,549
2117,“I can’t believe it.,550
2118,Dorian is far too sensible.”,550
2119,"“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear Basil.”",551
2120,"“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”",552
2121,"“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly.",553
2122,“But I didn’t say he was married.,553
2123,I said he was engaged to be married.,553
2124,There is a great difference.,553
2125,"I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged.",553
2126,I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.”,553
2127,"“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth.",554
2128,It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”,554
2129,"“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil.",555
2130,"He is sure to do it, then.",555
2131,"Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives.”",555
2132,"“I hope the girl is good, Harry.",556
2133,"I don’t want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect.”",556
2134,"“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters.",557
2135,"“Dorian says she is beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind.",557
2136,Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people.,557
2137,"It has had that excellent effect, amongst others.",557
2138,"We are to see her to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his appointment.”",557
2139,“Are you serious?”,558
2140,"“Quite serious, Basil.",559
2141,I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment.”,559
2142,"“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up and down the room and biting his lip.",560
2143,"“You can’t approve of it, possibly.",560
2144,It is some silly infatuation.”,560
2145,"“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now.",561
2146,It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.,561
2147,We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices.,561
2148,"I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.",561
2149,"If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me.",561
2150,"Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her.",561
2151,Why not?,561
2152,"If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the less interesting.",561
2153,You know I am not a champion of marriage.,561
2154,The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish.,561
2155,And unselfish people are colourless.,561
2156,They lack individuality.,561
2157,"Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex.",561
2158,"They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos.",561
2159,They are forced to have more than one life.,561
2160,"They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man’s existence.",561
2161,"Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience.",561
2162,"I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else.",561
2163,He would be a wonderful study.”,561
2164,"“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don’t.",562
2165,"If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself.",562
2166,You are much better than you pretend to be.”,562
2167,Lord Henry laughed.,563
2168,“The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves.,563
2169,The basis of optimism is sheer terror.,563
2170,We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us.,563
2171,"We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets.",563
2172,I mean everything that I have said.,563
2173,I have the greatest contempt for optimism.,563
2174,"As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested.",563
2175,"If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it.",563
2176,"As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.",563
2177,I will certainly encourage them.,563
2178,They have the charm of being fashionable.,563
2179,But here is Dorian himself.,563
2180,He will tell you more than I can.”,563
2181,"“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said the lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn.",564
2182,“I have never been so happy.,564
2183,"Of course, it is sudden—all really delightful things are.",564
2184,"And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life.” He was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome.",564
2185,"“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward, “but I don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.",565
2186,You let Harry know.”,565
2187,"“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in Lord Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he spoke.",566
2188,"“Come, let us sit down and try what the new _chef_ here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about.”",566
2189,"“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their seats at the small round table.",567
2190,“What happened was simply this.,567
2191,"After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight o’clock to the theatre.",567
2192,Sibyl was playing Rosalind.,567
2193,"Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd.",567
2194,But Sibyl!,567
2195,You should have seen her!,567
2196,"When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she was perfectly wonderful.",567
2197,"She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red.",567
2198,She had never seemed to me more exquisite.,567
2199,"She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil.",567
2200,Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose.,567
2201,"As for her acting—well, you shall see her to-night.",567
2202,She is simply a born artist.,567
2203,I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled.,567
2204,I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century.,567
2205,I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen.,567
2206,"After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her.",567
2207,"As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before.",567
2208,My lips moved towards hers.,567
2209,We kissed each other.,567
2210,I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment.,567
2211,It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy.,567
2212,She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus.,567
2213,Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands.,567
2214,"I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it.",567
2215,"Of course, our engagement is a dead secret.",567
2216,She has not even told her own mother.,567
2217,I don’t know what my guardians will say.,567
2218,Lord Radley is sure to be furious.,567
2219,I don’t care.,567
2220,"I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like.",567
2221,"I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays?",567
2222,Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.,567
2223,"I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.”",567
2224,"“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.",568
2225,“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.,569
2226,Dorian Gray shook his head.,570
2227,“I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall find her in an orchard in Verona.”,570
2228,Lord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner.,571
2229,"“At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian?",571
2230,And what did she say in answer?,571
2231,Perhaps you forgot all about it.”,571
2232,"“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal.",572
2233,"I told her that I loved her, and she said she was not worthy to be my wife.",572
2234,Not worthy!,572
2235,"Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her.”",572
2236,"“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much more practical than we are.",573
2237,"In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”",573
2238,Hallward laid his hand upon his arm.,574
2239,"“Don’t, Harry.",574
2240,You have annoyed Dorian.,574
2241,He is not like other men.,574
2242,He would never bring misery upon any one.,574
2243,His nature is too fine for that.”,574
2244,Lord Henry looked across the table.,575
2245,"“Dorian is never annoyed with me,” he answered.",575
2246,"“I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any question—simple curiosity.",575
2247,"I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.",575
2248,"Except, of course, in middle-class life.",575
2249,But then the middle classes are not modern.”,575
2250,"Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head.",576
2251,"“You are quite incorrigible, Harry; but I don’t mind.",576
2252,It is impossible to be angry with you.,576
2253,"When you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast, a beast without a heart.",576
2254,I cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves.,576
2255,I love Sibyl Vane.,576
2256,I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine.,576
2257,What is marriage?,576
2258,An irrevocable vow.,576
2259,You mock at it for that.,576
2260,Ah!,576
2261,don’t mock.,576
2262,It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take.,576
2263,"Her trust makes me faithful, her belief makes me good.",576
2264,"When I am with her, I regret all that you have taught me.",576
2265,I become different from what you have known me to be.,576
2266,"I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane’s hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.”",576
2267,"“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.",577
2268,"“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure.",578
2269,"All your theories, in fact, Harry.”",578
2270,"“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he answered in his slow melodious voice.",579
2271,“But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory as my own.,579
2272,"It belongs to Nature, not to me.",579
2273,"Pleasure is Nature’s test, her sign of approval.",579
2274,"When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.”",579
2275,“Ah!,580
2276,but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.,580
2277,"“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”",581
2278,"“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.",582
2279,“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.,582
2280,One’s own life—that is the important thing.,582
2281,"As for the lives of one’s neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral views about them, but they are not one’s concern.",582
2282,"Besides, individualism has really the higher aim.",582
2283,Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one’s age.,582
2284,I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.”,582
2285,"“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a terrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.",583
2286,"“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays.",584
2287,I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial.,584
2288,"Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.”",584
2289,“One has to pay in other ways but money.”,585
2290,"“What sort of ways, Basil?”",586
2291,“Oh!,587
2292,"I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the consciousness of degradation.”",587
2293,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.,588
2294,"“My dear fellow, mediæval art is charming, but mediæval emotions are out of date.",588
2295,"One can use them in fiction, of course.",588
2296,But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact.,588
2297,"Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is.”",588
2298,"“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray.",589
2299,“It is to adore some one.”,589
2300,"“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying with some fruits.",590
2301,“Being adored is a nuisance.,590
2302,Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods.,590
2303,"They worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them.”",590
2304,"“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us,” murmured the lad gravely.",591
2305,“They create love in our natures.,591
2306,They have a right to demand it back.”,591
2307,"“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.",592
2308,"“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.",593
2309,"“This is,” interrupted Dorian.",594
2310,"“You must admit, Harry, that women give to men the very gold of their lives.”",594
2311,"“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in such very small change.",595
2312,That is the worry.,595
2313,"Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.”",595
2314,"“Harry, you are dreadful!",596
2315,I don’t know why I like you so much.”,596
2316,"“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied.",597
2317,"“Will you have some coffee, you fellows?",597
2318,"Waiter, bring coffee, and _fine-champagne_, and some cigarettes.",597
2319,"No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some.",597
2320,"Basil, I can’t allow you to smoke cigars.",597
2321,You must have a cigarette.,597
2322,A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure.,597
2323,"It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.",597
2324,What more can one want?,597
2325,"Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me.",597
2326,I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.”,597
2327,"“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.",598
2328,“Let us go down to the theatre.,598
2329,When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life.,598
2330,She will represent something to you that you have never known.”,598
2331,"“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion.",599
2332,"I am afraid, however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing.",599
2333,"Still, your wonderful girl may thrill me.",599
2334,I love acting.,599
2335,It is so much more real than life.,599
2336,Let us go.,599
2337,"Dorian, you will come with me.",599
2338,"I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.",599
2339,You must follow us in a hansom.”,599
2340,"They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing.",600
2341,The painter was silent and preoccupied.,600
2342,There was a gloom over him.,600
2343,"He could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened.",600
2344,"After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs.",600
2345,"He drove off by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him.",600
2346,A strange sense of loss came over him.,600
2347,He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past.,600
2348,"Life had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes.",600
2349,"When the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him that he had grown years older.",600
2350, CHAPTER VII.,602
2351," For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile.",603
2352,"He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice.",603
2353,Dorian Gray loathed him more than ever.,603
2354,He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban.,603
2355,"Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him.",603
2356,"At least he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet.",603
2357,Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit.,603
2358,"The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire.",603
2359,The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side.,603
2360,They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them.,603
2361,Some women were laughing in the pit.,603
2362,Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant.,603
2363,The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.,603
2364,“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.,604
2365,“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray.,605
2366,"“It was here I found her, and she is divine beyond all living things.",605
2367,"When she acts, you will forget everything.",605
2368,"These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she is on the stage.",605
2369,They sit silently and watch her.,605
2370,They weep and laugh as she wills them to do.,605
2371,She makes them as responsive as a violin.,605
2372,"She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one’s self.”",605
2373,“The same flesh and blood as one’s self!,606
2374,"Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his opera-glass.",606
2375,"“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter.",607
2376,"“I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.",607
2377,"Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble.",607
2378,To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth doing.,607
2379,"If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world.",607
2380,This marriage is quite right.,607
2381,"I did not think so at first, but I admit it now.",607
2382,The gods made Sibyl Vane for you.,607
2383,Without her you would have been incomplete.”,607
2384,"“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand.",608
2385,“I knew that you would understand me.,608
2386,"Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me.",608
2387,But here is the orchestra.,608
2388,"It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five minutes.",608
2389,"Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me.”",608
2390,"A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.",609
2391,"Yes, she was certainly lovely to look at—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen.",609
2392,There was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes.,609
2393,"A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house.",609
2394,She stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble.,609
2395,Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud.,609
2396,"Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her.",609
2397,"Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming!",609
2398,charming!”,609
2399,"The scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his pilgrim’s dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends.",610
2400,"The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.",610
2401,"Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world.",610
2402,"Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant sways in the water.",610
2403,The curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily.,610
2404,Her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.,610
2405,Yet she was curiously listless.,611
2406,She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on Romeo.,611
2407,The few words she had to speak—,611
2408,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,     Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,     And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—",612
2409," with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner.",613
2410,"The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false.",613
2411,It was wrong in colour.,613
2412,It took away all the life from the verse.,613
2413,It made the passion unreal.,613
2414,Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.,614
2415,He was puzzled and anxious.,614
2416,Neither of his friends dared to say anything to him.,614
2417,She seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent.,614
2418,They were horribly disappointed.,614
2419,Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act.,615
2420,They waited for that.,615
2421,"If she failed there, there was nothing in her.",615
2422,She looked charming as she came out in the moonlight.,616
2423,That could not be denied.,616
2424,"But the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she went on.",616
2425,Her gestures became absurdly artificial.,616
2426,She overemphasized everything that she had to say.,616
2427,The beautiful passage—,616
2428,"Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—",617
2429, was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.,618
2430,When she leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines—,618
2431,"Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good-night!",619
2432,This bud of love by summer’s ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—,619
2433, she spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her.,620
2434,It was not nervousness.,620
2435,"Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely self-contained.",620
2436,It was simply bad art.,620
2437,She was a complete failure.,620
2438,Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play.,621
2439,"They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle.",621
2440,"The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage.",621
2441,The only person unmoved was the girl herself.,621
2442,"When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got up from his chair and put on his coat.",622
2443,"“She is quite beautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she can’t act.",622
2444,Let us go.”,622
2445,"“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard bitter voice.",623
2446,"“I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry.",623
2447,I apologize to you both.”,623
2448,"“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted Hallward.",624
2449,“We will come some other night.”,624
2450,"“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined.",625
2451,“But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold.,625
2452,She has entirely altered.,625
2453,Last night she was a great artist.,625
2454,This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”,625
2455,"“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.",626
2456,Love is a more wonderful thing than art.”,626
2457,"“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry.",627
2458,“But do let us go.,627
2459,"Dorian, you must not stay here any longer.",627
2460,It is not good for one’s morals to see bad acting.,627
2461,"Besides, I don’t suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll?",627
2462,"She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience.",627
2463,"There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating—people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.",627
2464,"Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic!",627
2465,The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.,627
2466,Come to the club with Basil and myself.,627
2467,We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.,627
2468,She is beautiful.,627
2469,What more can you want?”,627
2470,"“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad.",628
2471,“I want to be alone.,628
2472,"Basil, you must go.",628
2473,Ah!,628
2474,can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot tears came to his eyes.,628
2475,"His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.",628
2476,"“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his voice, and the two young men passed out together.",629
2477,A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act.,630
2478,Dorian Gray went back to his seat.,630
2479,"He looked pale, and proud, and indifferent.",630
2480,"The play dragged on, and seemed interminable.",630
2481,"Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots and laughing.",630
2482,The whole thing was a _fiasco_.,630
2483,The last act was played to almost empty benches.,630
2484,The curtain went down on a titter and some groans.,630
2485,"As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom.",631
2486,"The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on her face.",631
2487,Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.,631
2488,There was a radiance about her.,631
2489,Her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own.,631
2490,"When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over her.",632
2491,"“How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.",632
2492,"“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement.",633
2493,“Horribly!,633
2494,It was dreadful.,633
2495,Are you ill?,633
2496,You have no idea what it was.,633
2497,You have no idea what I suffered.”,633
2498,The girl smiled.,634
2499,"“Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name with long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth.",634
2500,"“Dorian, you should have understood.",634
2501,"But you understand now, don’t you?”",634
2502,"“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.",635
2503,“Why I was so bad to-night.,636
2504,Why I shall always be bad.,636
2505,Why I shall never act well again.”,636
2506,He shrugged his shoulders.,637
2507,"“You are ill, I suppose.",637
2508,When you are ill you shouldn’t act.,637
2509,You make yourself ridiculous.,637
2510,My friends were bored.,637
2511,I was bored.”,637
2512,She seemed not to listen to him.,638
2513,She was transfigured with joy.,638
2514,An ecstasy of happiness dominated her.,638
2515,"“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life.",639
2516,It was only in the theatre that I lived.,639
2517,I thought that it was all true.,639
2518,I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.,639
2519,"The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also.",639
2520,I believed in everything.,639
2521,The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike.,639
2522,The painted scenes were my world.,639
2523,"I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real.",639
2524,"You came—oh, my beautiful love!—and you freed my soul from prison.",639
2525,You taught me what reality really is.,639
2526,"To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played.",639
2527,"To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say.",639
2528,"You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.",639
2529,You had made me understand what love really is.,639
2530,My love!,639
2531,My love!,639
2532,Prince Charming!,639
2533,Prince of life!,639
2534,I have grown sick of shadows.,639
2535,You are more to me than all art can ever be.,639
2536,What have I to do with the puppets of a play?,639
2537,"When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me.",639
2538,I thought that I was going to be wonderful.,639
2539,I found that I could do nothing.,639
2540,Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant.,639
2541,The knowledge was exquisite to me.,639
2542,"I heard them hissing, and I smiled.",639
2543,What could they know of love such as ours?,639
2544,"Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we can be quite alone.",639
2545,I hate the stage.,639
2546,"I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire.",639
2547,"Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies?",639
2548,"Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love.",639
2549,You have made me see that.”,639
2550,He flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face.,640
2551,"“You have killed my love,” he muttered.",640
2552,She looked at him in wonder and laughed.,641
2553,He made no answer.,641
2554,"She came across to him, and with her little fingers stroked his hair.",641
2555,She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.,641
2556,"He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.",641
2557,Then he leaped up and went to the door.,642
2558,"“Yes,” he cried, “you have killed my love.",642
2559,You used to stir my imagination.,642
2560,Now you don’t even stir my curiosity.,642
2561,You simply produce no effect.,642
2562,"I loved you because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.",642
2563,You have thrown it all away.,642
2564,You are shallow and stupid.,642
2565,My God!,642
2566,how mad I was to love you!,642
2567,What a fool I have been!,642
2568,You are nothing to me now.,642
2569,I will never see you again.,642
2570,I will never think of you.,642
2571,I will never mention your name.,642
2572,"You don’t know what you were to me, once.",642
2573,"Why, once ... Oh, I can’t bear to think of it!",642
2574,I wish I had never laid eyes upon you!,642
2575,You have spoiled the romance of my life.,642
2576,"How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art!",642
2577,"Without your art, you are nothing.",642
2578,"I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent.",642
2579,"The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.",642
2580,What are you now?,642
2581,A third-rate actress with a pretty face.”,642
2582,"The girl grew white, and trembled.",643
2583,"She clenched her hands together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat.",643
2584,"“You are not serious, Dorian?” she murmured.",643
2585,“You are acting.”,643
2586,“Acting!,644
2587,I leave that to you.,644
2588,"You do it so well,” he answered bitterly.",644
2589,"She rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her face, came across the room to him.",645
2590,She put her hand upon his arm and looked into his eyes.,645
2591,He thrust her back.,645
2592,“Don’t touch me!” he cried.,645
2593,"A low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay there like a trampled flower.",646
2594,"“Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she whispered.",646
2595,“I am so sorry I didn’t act well.,646
2596,I was thinking of you all the time.,646
2597,"But I will try—indeed, I will try.",646
2598,"It came so suddenly across me, my love for you.",646
2599,I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me—if we had not kissed each other.,646
2600,"Kiss me again, my love.",646
2601,Don’t go away from me.,646
2602,I couldn’t bear it.,646
2603,Oh!,646
2604,don’t go away from me.,646
2605,My brother ... No; never mind.,646
2606,He didn’t mean it.,646
2607,He was in jest....,646
2608,"But you, oh!",646
2609,can’t you forgive me for to-night?,646
2610,I will work so hard and try to improve.,646
2611,"Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better than anything in the world.",646
2612,"After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you.",646
2613,"But you are quite right, Dorian.",646
2614,I should have shown myself more of an artist.,646
2615,"It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help it.",646
2616,"Oh, don’t leave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing choked her.",646
2617,"She crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.",646
2618,There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.,646
2619,Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.,646
2620,Her tears and sobs annoyed him.,646
2621,"“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice.",647
2622,"“I don’t wish to be unkind, but I can’t see you again.",647
2623,You have disappointed me.”,647
2624,"She wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer.",648
2625,"Her little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him.",648
2626,He turned on his heel and left the room.,648
2627,In a few moments he was out of the theatre.,648
2628,Where he went to he hardly knew.,649
2629,"He remembered wandering through dimly lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses.",649
2630,Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him.,649
2631,"Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes.",649
2632,"He had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.",649
2633,"As the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden.",650
2634,"The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl.",650
2635,Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.,650
2636,"The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain.",650
2637,He followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons.,650
2638,A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries.,650
2639,"He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly.",650
2640,"They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them.",650
2641,"A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of vegetables.",650
2642,"Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over.",650
2643,Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.,650
2644,"The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings.",650
2645,Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.,650
2646,"Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.",650
2647,"After a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home.",651
2648,"For a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.",651
2649,"The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it.",651
2650,From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising.,651
2651,"It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.",651
2652,"In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.",652
2653,"He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for luxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.",652
2654,"As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him.",652
2655,He started back as if in surprise.,652
2656,"Then he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled.",652
2657,"After he had taken the button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate.",652
2658,"Finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.",652
2659,"In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed.",652
2660,The expression looked different.,652
2661,One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth.,652
2662,It was certainly strange.,652
2663,"He turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind.",653
2664,"The bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.",653
2665,"But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even.",653
2666,The quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.,653
2667,"He winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly into its polished depths.",654
2668,No line like that warped his red lips.,654
2669,What did it mean?,654
2670,"He rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again.",655
2671,"There were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered.",655
2672,It was not a mere fancy of his own.,655
2673,The thing was horribly apparent.,655
2674,He threw himself into a chair and began to think.,656
2675,Suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the day the picture had been finished.,656
2676,"Yes, he remembered it perfectly.",656
2677,"He had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood.",656
2678,Surely his wish had not been fulfilled?,656
2679,Such things were impossible.,656
2680,It seemed monstrous even to think of them.,656
2681,"And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in the mouth.",656
2682,Cruelty!,657
2683,Had he been cruel?,657
2684,"It was the girl’s fault, not his.",657
2685,"He had dreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had thought her great.",657
2686,Then she had disappointed him.,657
2687,She had been shallow and unworthy.,657
2688,"And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child.",657
2689,He remembered with what callousness he had watched her.,657
2690,Why had he been made like that?,657
2691,Why had such a soul been given to him?,657
2692,But he had suffered also.,657
2693,"During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture.",657
2694,His life was well worth hers.,657
2695,"She had marred him for a moment, if he had wounded her for an age.",657
2696,"Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men.",657
2697,They lived on their emotions.,657
2698,They only thought of their emotions.,657
2699,"When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes.",657
2700,"Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were.",657
2701,Why should he trouble about Sibyl Vane?,657
2702,She was nothing to him now.,657
2703,But the picture?,658
2704,What was he to say of that?,658
2705,"It held the secret of his life, and told his story.",658
2706,It had taught him to love his own beauty.,658
2707,Would it teach him to loathe his own soul?,658
2708,Would he ever look at it again?,658
2709,No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses.,659
2710,The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it.,659
2711,Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad.,659
2712,The picture had not changed.,659
2713,It was folly to think so.,659
2714,"Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile.",660
2715,Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.,660
2716,Its blue eyes met his own.,660
2717,"A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him.",660
2718,"It had altered already, and would alter more.",660
2719,Its gold would wither into grey.,660
2720,Its red and white roses would die.,660
2721,"For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness.",660
2722,But he would not sin.,660
2723,"The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience.",660
2724,He would resist temptation.,660
2725,"He would not see Lord Henry any more—would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things.",660
2726,"He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again.",660
2727,"Yes, it was his duty to do so.",660
2728,She must have suffered more than he had.,660
2729,Poor child!,660
2730,He had been selfish and cruel to her.,660
2731,The fascination that she had exercised over him would return.,660
2732,They would be happy together.,660
2733,His life with her would be beautiful and pure.,660
2734,"He got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it.",661
2735,"“How horrible!” he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it.",661
2736,"When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath.",661
2737,The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions.,661
2738,He thought only of Sibyl.,661
2739,A faint echo of his love came back to him.,661
2740,He repeated her name over and over again.,661
2741,The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.,661
2742, CHAPTER VIII.,663
2743, It was long past noon when he awoke.,664
2744,"His valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late.",664
2745,"Finally his bell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.",664
2746,"“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.",665
2747,"“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.",666
2748,"“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”",667
2749,How late it was!,668
2750,"He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his letters.",668
2751,"One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning.",668
2752,"He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside.",668
2753,The others he opened listlessly.,668
2754,"They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season.",668
2755,"There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.",668
2756,"After about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom.",669
2757,The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep.,669
2758,He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through.,669
2759,"A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.",669
2760,"As soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window.",670
2761,It was an exquisite day.,670
2762,The warm air seemed laden with spices.,670
2763,"A bee flew in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before him.",670
2764,He felt perfectly happy.,670
2765,"Suddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait, and he started.",671
2766,"“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on the table.",672
2767,“I shut the window?”,672
2768,Dorian shook his head.,673
2769,"“I am not cold,” he murmured.",673
2770,Was it all true?,674
2771,Had the portrait really changed?,674
2772,Or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy?,674
2773,Surely a painted canvas could not alter?,674
2774,The thing was absurd.,674
2775,It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day.,674
2776,It would make him smile.,674
2777,"And, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing!",675
2778,"First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips.",675
2779,He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room.,675
2780,He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait.,675
2781,He was afraid of certainty.,675
2782,"When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain.",675
2783,"As the door was closing behind him, he called him back.",675
2784,The man stood waiting for his orders.,675
2785,Dorian looked at him for a moment.,675
2786,"“I am not at home to any one, Victor,” he said with a sigh.",675
2787,The man bowed and retired.,675
2788,"Then he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.",676
2789,"The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.",676
2790,"He scanned it curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man’s life.",676
2791,"Should he move it aside, after all?",677
2792,Why not let it stay there?,677
2793,What was the use of knowing?,677
2794,"If the thing was true, it was terrible.",677
2795,"If it was not true, why trouble about it?",677
2796,"But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change?",677
2797,What should he do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his own picture?,677
2798,Basil would be sure to do that.,677
2799,"No; the thing had to be examined, and at once.",677
2800,Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.,677
2801,He got up and locked both doors.,678
2802,At least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame.,678
2803,Then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face.,678
2804,It was perfectly true.,678
2805,The portrait had altered.,678
2806,"As he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest.",679
2807,That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him.,679
2808,And yet it was a fact.,679
2809,Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him?,679
2810,"Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?—that what it dreamed, they made true?",679
2811,"Or was there some other, more terrible reason?",679
2812,"He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.",679
2813,"One thing, however, he felt that it had done for him.",680
2814,"It had made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane.",680
2815,It was not too late to make reparation for that.,680
2816,She could still be his wife.,680
2817,"His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would be to him what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all.",680
2818,"There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep.",680
2819,But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.,680
2820,Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.,680
2821,"Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir.",681
2822,He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering.,681
2823,"He did not know what to do, or what to think.",681
2824,"Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.",681
2825,He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of pain.,681
2826,There is a luxury in self-reproach.,681
2827,"When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us.",681
2828,"It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.",681
2829,"When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.",681
2830,"Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s voice outside.",682
2831,"“My dear boy, I must see you.",682
2832,Let me in at once.,682
2833,I can’t bear your shutting yourself up like this.”,682
2834,"He made no answer at first, but remained quite still.",683
2835,The knocking still continued and grew louder.,683
2836,"Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable.",683
2837,"He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.",683
2838,"“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered.",684
2839,“But you must not think too much about it.”,684
2840,“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.,685
2841,"“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves.",686
2842,"“It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault.",686
2843,"Tell me, did you go behind and see her, after the play was over?”",686
2844,“Yes.”,687
2845,“I felt sure you had.,688
2846,Did you make a scene with her?”,688
2847,"“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal.",689
2848,But it is all right now.,689
2849,I am not sorry for anything that has happened.,689
2850,It has taught me to know myself better.”,689
2851,"“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!",690
2852,I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”,690
2853,"“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and smiling.",691
2854,“I am perfectly happy now.,691
2855,"I know what conscience is, to begin with.",691
2856,It is not what you told me it was.,691
2857,It is the divinest thing in us.,691
2858,"Don’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me.",691
2859,I want to be good.,691
2860,I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”,691
2861,"“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian!",692
2862,I congratulate you on it.,692
2863,But how are you going to begin?”,692
2864,“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”,693
2865,"“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him in perplexed amazement.",694
2866,"“But, my dear Dorian—”",694
2867,"“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say.",695
2868,Something dreadful about marriage.,695
2869,Don’t say it.,695
2870,Don’t ever say things of that kind to me again.,695
2871,Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me.,695
2872,I am not going to break my word to her.,695
2873,She is to be my wife.”,695
2874,“Your wife!,696
2875,Dorian!,696
2876,... Didn’t you get my letter?,696
2877,"I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”",696
2878,“Your letter?,697
2879,"Oh, yes, I remember.",697
2880,"I have not read it yet, Harry.",697
2881,I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like.,697
2882,You cut life to pieces with your epigrams.”,697
2883,“You know nothing then?”,698
2884,“What do you mean?”,699
2885,"Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray, took both his hands in his own and held them tightly.",700
2886,"“Dorian,” he said, “my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.”",700
2887,"A cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp.",701
2888,“Dead!,701
2889,Sibyl dead!,701
2890,It is not true!,701
2891,It is a horrible lie!,701
2892,How dare you say it?”,701
2893,"“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely.",702
2894,“It is in all the morning papers.,702
2895,I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came.,702
2896,"There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it.",702
2897,Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.,702
2898,But in London people are so prejudiced.,702
2899,"Here, one should never make one’s _début_ with a scandal.",702
2900,One should reserve that to give an interest to one’s old age.,702
2901,I suppose they don’t know your name at the theatre?,702
2902,"If they don’t, it is all right.",702
2903,Did any one see you going round to her room?,702
2904,That is an important point.”,702
2905,Dorian did not answer for a few moments.,703
2906,He was dazed with horror.,703
2907,"Finally he stammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an inquest?",703
2908,What did you mean by that?,703
2909,Did Sibyl—?,703
2910,"Oh, Harry, I can’t bear it!",703
2911,But be quick.,703
2912,Tell me everything at once.”,703
2913,"“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public.",704
2914,"It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something upstairs.",704
2915,"They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again.",704
2916,They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room.,704
2917,"She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres.",704
2918,"I don’t know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it.",704
2919,"I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously.”",704
2920,"“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.",705
2921,"“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it.",706
2922,I see by _The Standard_ that she was seventeen.,706
2923,I should have thought she was almost younger than that.,706
2924,"She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting.",706
2925,"Dorian, you mustn’t let this thing get on your nerves.",706
2926,"You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the opera.",706
2927,"It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there.",706
2928,You can come to my sister’s box.,706
2929,She has got some smart women with her.”,706
2930,"“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself, “murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.",707
2931,Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that.,707
2932,The birds sing just as happily in my garden.,707
2933,"And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards.",707
2934,How extraordinarily dramatic life is!,707
2935,"If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.",707
2936,"Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.",707
2937,Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life.,707
2938,"Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl.",707
2939,"Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead?",707
2940,Sibyl!,707
2941,"Can she feel, or know, or listen?",707
2942,"Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!",707
2943,It seems years ago to me now.,707
2944,She was everything to me.,707
2945,"Then came that dreadful night—was it really only last night?—when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke.",707
2946,She explained it all to me.,707
2947,It was terribly pathetic.,707
2948,But I was not moved a bit.,707
2949,I thought her shallow.,707
2950,Suddenly something happened that made me afraid.,707
2951,"I can’t tell you what it was, but it was terrible.",707
2952,I said I would go back to her.,707
2953,I felt I had done wrong.,707
2954,And now she is dead.,707
2955,My God!,707
2956,My God!,707
2957,"Harry, what shall I do?",707
2958,"You don’t know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.",707
2959,She would have done that for me.,707
2960,She had no right to kill herself.,707
2961,It was selfish of her.”,707
2962,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case and producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life.",708
2963,"If you had married this girl, you would have been wretched.",708
2964,"Of course, you would have treated her kindly.",708
2965,One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing.,708
2966,But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her.,708
2967,"And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay for.",708
2968,"I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been abject—which, of course, I would not have allowed—but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.”",708
2969,"“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale.",709
2970,“But I thought it was my duty.,709
2971,It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right.,709
2972,I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions—that they are always made too late.,709
2973,Mine certainly were.”,709
2974,“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws.,710
2975,Their origin is pure vanity.,710
2976,Their result is absolutely _nil_.,710
2977,"They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak.",710
2978,That is all that can be said for them.,710
2979,They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.”,710
2980,"“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him, “why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?",711
2981,I don’t think I am heartless.,711
2982,Do you?”,711
2983,"“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with his sweet melancholy smile.",712
2984,The lad frowned.,713
2985,"“I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he rejoined, “but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless.",713
2986,I am nothing of the kind.,713
2987,I know I am not.,713
2988,And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should.,713
2989,It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.,713
2990,"It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but by which I have not been wounded.”",713
2991,"“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an extremely interesting question.",714
2992,"I fancy that the true explanation is this: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.",714
2993,They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.,714
2994,"They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.",714
2995,"Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives.",714
2996,"If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.",714
2997,"Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play.",714
2998,Or rather we are both.,714
2999,"We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us.",714
3000,"In the present case, what is it that has really happened?",714
3001,Some one has killed herself for love of you.,714
3002,I wish that I had ever had such an experience.,714
3003,It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life.,714
3004,"The people who have adored me—there have not been very many, but there have been some—have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me.",714
3005,"They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences.",714
3006,That awful memory of woman!,714
3007,What a fearful thing it is!,714
3008,And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals!,714
3009,"One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details.",714
3010,Details are always vulgar.”,714
3011,"“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian.",715
3012,"“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion.",716
3013,“Life has always poppies in her hands.,716
3014,"Of course, now and then things linger.",716
3015,"I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die.",716
3016,"Ultimately, however, it did die.",716
3017,I forget what killed it.,716
3018,I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me.,716
3019,That is always a dreadful moment.,716
3020,It fills one with the terror of eternity.,716
3021,"Well—would you believe it?—a week ago, at Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future.",716
3022,I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.,716
3023,She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life.,716
3024,"I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety.",716
3025,But what a lack of taste she showed!,716
3026,The one charm of the past is that it is the past.,716
3027,But women never know when the curtain has fallen.,716
3028,"They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it.",716
3029,"If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.",716
3030,"They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art.",716
3031,You are more fortunate than I am.,716
3032,"I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.",716
3033,Ordinary women always console themselves.,716
3034,Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours.,716
3035,"Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.",716
3036,It always means that they have a history.,716
3037,Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.,716
3038,"They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.",716
3039,Religion consoles some.,716
3040,"Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.",716
3041,"Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.",716
3042,Conscience makes egotists of us all.,716
3043,Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life.,716
3044,"Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”",716
3045,"“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly.",717
3046,"“Oh, the obvious consolation.",718
3047,Taking some one else’s admirer when one loses one’s own.,718
3048,In good society that always whitewashes a woman.,718
3049,"But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets!",718
3050,There is something to me quite beautiful about her death.,718
3051,I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.,718
3052,"They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love.”",718
3053,“I was terribly cruel to her.,719
3054,You forget that.”,719
3055,"“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else.",720
3056,They have wonderfully primitive instincts.,720
3057,"We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same.",720
3058,They love being dominated.,720
3059,I am sure you were splendid.,720
3060,"I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked.",720
3061,"And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to everything.”",720
3062,"“What was that, Harry?”",721
3063,"“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”",722
3064,"“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying his face in his hands.",723
3065,"“No, she will never come to life.",724
3066,She has played her last part.,724
3067,"But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.",724
3068,"The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died.",724
3069,"To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare’s plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare’s music sounded richer and more full of joy.",724
3070,"The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away.",724
3071,"Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.",724
3072,Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled.,724
3073,Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died.,724
3074,But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane.,724
3075,She was less real than they are.”,724
3076,There was a silence.,725
3077,The evening darkened in the room.,725
3078,"Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.",725
3079,The colours faded wearily out of things.,725
3080,After some time Dorian Gray looked up.,726
3081,"“You have explained me to myself, Harry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief.",726
3082,"“I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself.",726
3083,How well you know me!,726
3084,But we will not talk again of what has happened.,726
3085,It has been a marvellous experience.,726
3086,That is all.,726
3087,I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.”,726
3088,"“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.",727
3089,"There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”",727
3090,"“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled?",728
3091,What then?”,728
3092,"“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories.",729
3093,"As it is, they are brought to you.",729
3094,"No, you must keep your good looks.",729
3095,"We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.",729
3096,We cannot spare you.,729
3097,And now you had better dress and drive down to the club.,729
3098,"We are rather late, as it is.”",729
3099,"“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry.",730
3100,I feel too tired to eat anything.,730
3101,What is the number of your sister’s box?”,730
3102,"“Twenty-seven, I believe.",731
3103,It is on the grand tier.,731
3104,You will see her name on the door.,731
3105,But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”,731
3106,"“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly.",732
3107,“But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me.,732
3108,You are certainly my best friend.,732
3109,No one has ever understood me as you have.”,732
3110,"“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, shaking him by the hand.",733
3111,“Good-bye.,733
3112,"I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope.",733
3113,"Remember, Patti is singing.”",733
3114,"As he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.",734
3115,He waited impatiently for him to go.,734
3116,The man seemed to take an interminable time over everything.,734
3117,"As soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back.",735
3118,No; there was no further change in the picture.,735
3119,It had received the news of Sibyl Vane’s death before he had known of it himself.,735
3120,It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred.,735
3121,"The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was.",735
3122,Or was it indifferent to results?,735
3123,Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul?,735
3124,"He wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.",735
3125,Poor Sibyl!,736
3126,What a romance it had all been!,736
3127,She had often mimicked death on the stage.,736
3128,Then Death himself had touched her and taken her with him.,736
3129,How had she played that dreadful last scene?,736
3130,"Had she cursed him, as she died?",736
3131,"No; she had died for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now.",736
3132,She had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life.,736
3133,"He would not think any more of what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.",736
3134,"When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love.",736
3135,A wonderful tragic figure?,736
3136,"Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace.",736
3137,He brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture.,736
3138,He felt that the time had really come for making his choice.,737
3139,Or had his choice already been made?,737
3140,"Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and his own infinite curiosity about life.",737
3141,"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have all these things.",737
3142,The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.,737
3143,A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas.,738
3144,"Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him.",738
3145,"Morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times.",738
3146,Was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded?,738
3147,"Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?",738
3148,The pity of it!,738
3149,the pity of it!,738
3150,"For a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease.",739
3151,It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged.,739
3152,"And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?",739
3153,"Besides, was it really under his control?",739
3154,Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution?,739
3155,Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all?,739
3156,"If thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things?",739
3157,"Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?",739
3158,But the reason was of no importance.,739
3159,He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power.,739
3160,"If the picture was to alter, it was to alter.",739
3161,That was all.,739
3162,Why inquire too closely into it?,739
3163,For there would be a real pleasure in watching it.,740
3164,He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places.,740
3165,This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors.,740
3166,"As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul.",740
3167,"And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer.",740
3168,"When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood.",740
3169,Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade.,740
3170,Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken.,740
3171,"Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous.",740
3172,What did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas?,740
3173,He would be safe.,740
3174,That was everything.,740
3175,"He drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was already waiting for him.",741
3176,"An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.",741
3177, CHAPTER IX.,743
3178," As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room.",744
3179,"“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely.",745
3180,"“I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera.",745
3181,"Of course, I knew that was impossible.",745
3182,But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.,745
3183,"I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another.",745
3184,I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first.,745
3185,I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of _The Globe_ that I picked up at the club.,745
3186,I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you.,745
3187,I can’t tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing.,745
3188,I know what you must suffer.,745
3189,But where were you?,745
3190,Did you go down and see the girl’s mother?,745
3191,For a moment I thought of following you there.,745
3192,They gave the address in the paper.,745
3193,"Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it?",745
3194,But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.,745
3195,Poor woman!,745
3196,What a state she must be in!,745
3197,"And her only child, too!",745
3198,What did she say about it all?”,745
3199,"“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored.",746
3200,“I was at the opera.,746
3201,You should have come on there.,746
3202,"I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time.",746
3203,We were in her box.,746
3204,She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely.,746
3205,Don’t talk about horrid subjects.,746
3206,"If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it has never happened.",746
3207,"It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things.",746
3208,I may mention that she was not the woman’s only child.,746
3209,"There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe.",746
3210,But he is not on the stage.,746
3211,"He is a sailor, or something.",746
3212,"And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting.”",746
3213,"“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice.",747
3214,“You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging?,747
3215,"You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?",747
3216,"Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!”",747
3217,"“Stop, Basil!",748
3218,"I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his feet.",748
3219,“You must not tell me about things.,748
3220,What is done is done.,748
3221,What is past is past.”,748
3222,“You call yesterday the past?”,749
3223,“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?,750
3224,It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion.,750
3225,A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure.,750
3226,I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions.,750
3227,"I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.”",750
3228,"“Dorian, this is horrible!",751
3229,Something has changed you completely.,751
3230,"You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture.",751
3231,"But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then.",751
3232,You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world.,751
3233,"Now, I don’t know what has come over you.",751
3234,"You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.",751
3235,It is all Harry’s influence.,751
3236,I see that.”,751
3237,"The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.",752
3238,"“I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you.",752
3239,You only taught me to be vain.”,752
3240,"“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”",753
3241,"“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning round.",754
3242,“I don’t know what you want.,754
3243,What do you want?”,754
3244,"“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly.",755
3245,"“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on his shoulder, “you have come too late.",756
3246,"Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself—”",756
3247,“Killed herself!,757
3248,Good heavens!,757
3249,"is there no doubt about that?” cried Hallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.",757
3250,“My dear Basil!,758
3251,Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident?,758
3252,Of course she killed herself.”,758
3253,The elder man buried his face in his hands.,759
3254,"“How fearful,” he muttered, and a shudder ran through him.",759
3255,"“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it.",760
3256,It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age.,760
3257,"As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives.",760
3258,"They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious.",760
3259,You know what I mean—middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing.,760
3260,How different Sibyl was!,760
3261,She lived her finest tragedy.,760
3262,She was always a heroine.,760
3263,The last night she played—the night you saw her—she acted badly because she had known the reality of love.,760
3264,"When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.",760
3265,She passed again into the sphere of art.,760
3266,There is something of the martyr about her.,760
3267,"Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.",760
3268,"But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered.",760
3269,"If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six—you would have found me in tears.",760
3270,"Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through.",760
3271,I suffered immensely.,760
3272,Then it passed away.,760
3273,I cannot repeat an emotion.,760
3274,"No one can, except sentimentalists.",760
3275,"And you are awfully unjust, Basil.",760
3276,You come down here to console me.,760
3277,That is charming of you.,760
3278,"You find me consoled, and you are furious.",760
3279,How like a sympathetic person!,760
3280,"You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it was.",760
3281,"Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.",760
3282,"He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of _ennui_, and became a confirmed misanthrope.",760
3283,"And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view.",760
3284,Was it not Gautier who used to write about _la consolation des arts_?,760
3285,I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase.,760
3286,"Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.",760
3287,I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.,760
3288,"Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp—there is much to be got from all these.",760
3289,"But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me.",760
3290,"To become the spectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life.",760
3291,I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this.,760
3292,You have not realized how I have developed.,760
3293,I was a schoolboy when you knew me.,760
3294,I am a man now.,760
3295,"I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas.",760
3296,"I am different, but you must not like me less.",760
3297,"I am changed, but you must always be my friend.",760
3298,"Of course, I am very fond of Harry.",760
3299,But I know that you are better than he is.,760
3300,You are not stronger—you are too much afraid of life—but you are better.,760
3301,And how happy we used to be together!,760
3302,"Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me.",760
3303,I am what I am.,760
3304,There is nothing more to be said.”,760
3305,The painter felt strangely moved.,761
3306,"The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his personality had been the great turning point in his art.",761
3307,He could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more.,761
3308,"After all, his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.",761
3309,"There was so much in him that was good, so much in him that was noble.",761
3310,"“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I won’t speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.",762
3311,I only trust your name won’t be mentioned in connection with it.,762
3312,The inquest is to take place this afternoon.,762
3313,Have they summoned you?”,762
3314,"Dorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind.",763
3315,"“They don’t know my name,” he answered.",763
3316,“But surely she did?”,764
3317,"“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one.",765
3318,"She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was, and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming.",765
3319,It was pretty of her.,765
3320,"You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil.",765
3321,I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.”,765
3322,"“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.",766
3323,But you must come and sit to me yourself again.,766
3324,I can’t get on without you.”,766
3325,"“I can never sit to you again, Basil.",767
3326,"It is impossible!” he exclaimed, starting back.",767
3327,The painter stared at him.,768
3328,"“My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried.",768
3329,“Do you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you?,768
3330,Where is it?,768
3331,Why have you pulled the screen in front of it?,768
3332,Let me look at it.,768
3333,It is the best thing I have ever done.,768
3334,"Do take the screen away, Dorian.",768
3335,It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that.,768
3336,I felt the room looked different as I came in.”,768
3337,"“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.",769
3338,You don’t imagine I let him arrange my room for me?,769
3339,He settles my flowers for me sometimes—that is all.,769
3340,No; I did it myself.,769
3341,The light was too strong on the portrait.”,769
3342,“Too strong!,770
3343,"Surely not, my dear fellow?",770
3344,It is an admirable place for it.,770
3345,Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.,770
3346,"A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between the painter and the screen.",771
3347,"“Basil,” he said, looking very pale, “you must not look at it.",771
3348,I don’t wish you to.”,771
3349,“Not look at my own work!,772
3350,You are not serious.,772
3351,"Why shouldn’t I look at it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.",772
3352,"“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live.",773
3353,I am quite serious.,773
3354,"I don’t offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.",773
3355,"But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us.”",773
3356,Hallward was thunderstruck.,774
3357,He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement.,774
3358,He had never seen him like this before.,774
3359,The lad was actually pallid with rage.,774
3360,"His hands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire.",774
3361,He was trembling all over.,774
3362,“Dorian!”,775
3363,“Don’t speak!”,776
3364,“But what is the matter?,777
3365,"Of course I won’t look at it if you don’t want me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and going over towards the window.",777
3366,"“But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn.",777
3367,"I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”",777
3368,“To exhibit it!,778
3369,"You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him.",778
3370,Was the world going to be shown his secret?,778
3371,Were people to gape at the mystery of his life?,778
3372,That was impossible.,778
3373,Something—he did not know what—had to be done at once.,778
3374,“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that.,779
3375,"Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Sèze, which will open the first week in October.",779
3376,The portrait will only be away a month.,779
3377,I should think you could easily spare it for that time.,779
3378,"In fact, you are sure to be out of town.",779
3379,"And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can’t care much about it.”",779
3380,Dorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead.,780
3381,There were beads of perspiration there.,780
3382,He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger.,780
3383,"“You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he cried.",780
3384,“Why have you changed your mind?,780
3385,You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have.,780
3386,The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless.,780
3387,You can’t have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition.,780
3388,"You told Harry exactly the same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his eyes.",780
3389,"He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once, half seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture.",780
3390,"He told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his secret.",780
3391,He would ask him and try.,780
3392,"“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face, “we have each of us a secret.",781
3393,"Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine.",781
3394,What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?”,781
3395,The painter shuddered in spite of himself.,782
3396,"“Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.",782
3397,I could not bear your doing either of those two things.,782
3398,"If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content.",782
3399,I have always you to look at.,782
3400,"If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied.",782
3401,Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation.”,782
3402,"“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray.",783
3403,"“I think I have a right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place.",783
3404,He was determined to find out Basil Hallward’s mystery.,783
3405,"“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled.",784
3406,“Let us sit down.,784
3407,And just answer me one question.,784
3408,"Have you noticed in the picture something curious?—something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”",784
3409,"“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with trembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.",785
3410,“I see you did.,786
3411,Don’t speak.,786
3412,Wait till you hear what I have to say.,786
3413,"Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me.",786
3414,"I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you.",786
3415,You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream.,786
3416,I worshipped you.,786
3417,I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke.,786
3418,I wanted to have you all to myself.,786
3419,I was only happy when I was with you.,786
3420,"When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about this.",786
3421,It would have been impossible.,786
3422,You would not have understood it.,786
3423,I hardly understood it myself.,786
3424,"I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....",786
3425,"Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.",786
3426,Then came a new development.,786
3427,"I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-spear.",786
3428,"Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile.",786
3429,You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face.,786
3430,"And it had all been what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and remote.",786
3431,"One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time.",786
3432,"Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell.",786
3433,"But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.",786
3434,I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry.,786
3435,"I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.",786
3436,Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited.,786
3437,You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.,786
3438,"Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me.",786
3439,But I did not mind that.,786
3440,"When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint.",786
3441,Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.,786
3442,Art is always more abstract than we fancy.,786
3443,Form and colour tell us of form and colour—that is all.,786
3444,It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him.,786
3445,"And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.",786
3446,It never occurred to me that you would refuse.,786
3447,I see now that you were right.,786
3448,The picture cannot be shown.,786
3449,"You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you.",786
3450,"As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.”",786
3451,Dorian Gray drew a long breath.,787
3452,"The colour came back to his cheeks, and a smile played about his lips.",787
3453,The peril was over.,787
3454,He was safe for the time.,787
3455,"Yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend.",787
3456,Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.,787
3457,But that was all.,787
3458,He was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of.,787
3459,Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry?,787
3460,Was that one of the things that life had in store?,787
3461,"“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you should have seen this in the portrait.",788
3462,Did you really see it?”,788
3463,"“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed to me very curious.”",789
3464,"“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”",790
3465,Dorian shook his head.,791
3466,"“You must not ask me that, Basil.",791
3467,I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture.”,791
3468,"“You will some day, surely?”",792
3469,“Never.”,793
3470,"“Well, perhaps you are right.",794
3471,"And now good-bye, Dorian.",794
3472,You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.,794
3473,"Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you.",794
3474,Ah!,794
3475,you don’t know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you.”,794
3476,"“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me?",795
3477,Simply that you felt that you admired me too much.,795
3478,That is not even a compliment.”,795
3479,“It was not intended as a compliment.,796
3480,It was a confession.,796
3481,"Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.",796
3482,Perhaps one should never put one’s worship into words.”,796
3483,“It was a very disappointing confession.”,797
3484,"“Why, what did you expect, Dorian?",798
3485,"You didn’t see anything else in the picture, did you?",798
3486,There was nothing else to see?”,798
3487,“No; there was nothing else to see.,799
3488,Why do you ask?,799
3489,But you mustn’t talk about worship.,799
3490,It is foolish.,799
3491,"You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so.”",799
3492,"“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.",800
3493,"“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter.",801
3494,“Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable.,801
3495,Just the sort of life I would like to lead.,801
3496,But still I don’t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble.,801
3497,"I would sooner go to you, Basil.”",801
3498,“You will sit to me again?”,802
3499,“Impossible!”,803
3500,"“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.",804
3501,No man comes across two ideal things.,804
3502,Few come across one.”,804
3503,"“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again.",805
3504,There is something fatal about a portrait.,805
3505,It has a life of its own.,805
3506,I will come and have tea with you.,805
3507,That will be just as pleasant.”,805
3508,"“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully.",806
3509,“And now good-bye.,806
3510,I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture once again.,806
3511,But that can’t be helped.,806
3512,I quite understand what you feel about it.”,806
3513,"As he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.",807
3514,Poor Basil!,807
3515,How little he knew of the true reason!,807
3516,"And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his friend!",807
3517,How much that strange confession explained to him!,807
3518,"The painter’s absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his extravagant panegyrics, his curious reticences—he understood them all now, and he felt sorry.",807
3519,There seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.,807
3520,He sighed and touched the bell.,808
3521,The portrait must be hidden away at all costs.,808
3522,He could not run such a risk of discovery again.,808
3523,"It had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his friends had access.",808
3524, CHAPTER X.,810
3525," When his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.",811
3526,The man was quite impassive and waited for his orders.,811
3527,Dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it.,811
3528,He could see the reflection of Victor’s face perfectly.,811
3529,It was like a placid mask of servility.,811
3530,"There was nothing to be afraid of, there.",811
3531,Yet he thought it best to be on his guard.,811
3532,"Speaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he wanted to see her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to send two of his men round at once.",812
3533,It seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen.,812
3534,Or was that merely his own fancy?,812
3535,"After a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread mittens on her wrinkled hands, Mrs.",813
3536,Leaf bustled into the library.,813
3537,He asked her for the key of the schoolroom.,813
3538,"“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed.",814
3539,"“Why, it is full of dust.",814
3540,I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it.,814
3541,"It is not fit for you to see, sir.",814
3542,"It is not, indeed.”",814
3543,"“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf.",815
3544,I only want the key.”,815
3545,"“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it.",816
3546,"Why, it hasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship died.”",816
3547,He winced at the mention of his grandfather.,817
3548,He had hateful memories of him.,817
3549,"“That does not matter,” he answered.",817
3550,“I simply want to see the place—that is all.,817
3551,Give me the key.”,817
3552,"“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.",818
3553,“Here is the key.,818
3554,I’ll have it off the bunch in a moment.,818
3555,"But you don’t think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”",818
3556,"“No, no,” he cried petulantly.",819
3557,"“Thank you, Leaf.",819
3558,That will do.”,819
3559,"She lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the household.",820
3560,He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best.,820
3561,"She left the room, wreathed in smiles.",820
3562,"As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room.",821
3563,"His eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.",821
3564,"Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in.",821
3565,It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead.,821
3566,"Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.",821
3567,"What the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas.",821
3568,They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace.,821
3569,They would defile it and make it shameful.,821
3570,And yet the thing would still live on.,821
3571,It would be always alive.,821
3572,"He shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away.",822
3573,"Basil would have helped him to resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament.",822
3574,The love that he bore him—for it was really love—had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual.,822
3575,It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire.,822
3576,"It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.",822
3577,"Yes, Basil could have saved him.",822
3578,But it was too late now.,822
3579,The past could always be annihilated.,822
3580,"Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that.",822
3581,But the future was inevitable.,822
3582,"There were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.",822
3583,"He took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it, and, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen.",823
3584,Was the face on the canvas viler than before?,823
3585,"It seemed to him that it was unchanged, and yet his loathing of it was intensified.",823
3586,"Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips—they all were there.",823
3587,It was simply the expression that had altered.,823
3588,That was horrible in its cruelty.,823
3589,"Compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil’s reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!—how shallow, and of what little account!",823
3590,His own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement.,823
3591,"A look of pain came across him, and he flung the rich pall over the picture.",823
3592,"As he did so, a knock came to the door.",823
3593,He passed out as his servant entered.,823
3594,"“The persons are here, Monsieur.”",824
3595,He felt that the man must be got rid of at once.,825
3596,He must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to.,825
3597,"There was something sly about him, and he had thoughtful, treacherous eyes.",825
3598,"Sitting down at the writing-table he scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.",825
3599,"“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show the men in here.”",826
3600,"In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.",827
3601,"Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him.",827
3602,"As a rule, he never left his shop.",827
3603,He waited for people to come to him.,827
3604,But he always made an exception in favour of Dorian Gray.,827
3605,There was something about Dorian that charmed everybody.,827
3606,It was a pleasure even to see him.,827
3607,"“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat freckled hands.",828
3608,“I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person.,828
3609,"I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir.",828
3610,Picked it up at a sale.,828
3611,Old Florentine.,828
3612,"Came from Fonthill, I believe.",828
3613,"Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”",828
3614,"“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr. Hubbard.",829
3615,I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I don’t go in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me.,829
3616,"It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”",829
3617,"“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray.",830
3618,I am delighted to be of any service to you.,830
3619,"Which is the work of art, sir?”",830
3620,"“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back.",831
3621,"“Can you move it, covering and all, just as it is?",831
3622,I don’t want it to get scratched going upstairs.”,831
3623,"“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker, beginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended.",832
3624,"“And, now, where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?”",832
3625,"“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me.",833
3626,Or perhaps you had better go in front.,833
3627,I am afraid it is right at the top of the house.,833
3628,"We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”",833
3629,"He held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent.",834
3630,"The elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.",834
3631,"“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when they reached the top landing.",835
3632,And he wiped his shiny forehead.,835
3633,"“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.",836
3634,"He had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed, since he had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then as a study when he grew somewhat older.",837
3635,"It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance.",837
3636,It appeared to Dorian to have but little changed.,837
3637,"There was the huge Italian _cassone_, with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy.",837
3638,There the satinwood book-case filled with his dog-eared schoolbooks.,837
3639,"On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists.",837
3640,How well he remembered it all!,837
3641,Every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round.,837
3642,"He recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away.",837
3643,"How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him!",837
3644,But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this.,838
3645,"He had the key, and no one else could enter it.",838
3646,"Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean.",838
3647,What did it matter?,838
3648,No one could see it.,838
3649,He himself would not see it.,838
3650,Why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul?,838
3651,He kept his youth—that was enough.,838
3652,"And, besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all?",838
3653,There was no reason that the future should be so full of shame.,838
3654,"Some love might come across his life, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.",838
3655,"Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show to the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.",838
3656,No; that was impossible.,839
3657,"Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon the canvas was growing old.",839
3658,"It might escape the hideousness of sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.",839
3659,The cheeks would become hollow or flaccid.,839
3660,Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible.,839
3661,"The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are.",839
3662,"There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood.",839
3663,The picture had to be concealed.,839
3664,There was no help for it.,839
3665,"“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning round.",840
3666,“I am sorry I kept you so long.,840
3667,I was thinking of something else.”,840
3668,"“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath.",841
3669,"“Where shall we put it, sir?”",841
3670,"“Oh, anywhere.",842
3671,Here: this will do.,842
3672,I don’t want to have it hung up.,842
3673,Just lean it against the wall.,842
3674,Thanks.”,842
3675,"“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”",843
3676,Dorian started.,844
3677,"“It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said, keeping his eye on the man.",844
3678,He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life.,844
3679,“I shan’t trouble you any more now.,844
3680,I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.”,844
3681,"“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.",845
3682,"Ever ready to do anything for you, sir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face.",845
3683,He had never seen any one so marvellous.,845
3684,"When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket.",846
3685,He felt safe now.,846
3686,No one would ever look upon the horrible thing.,846
3687,No eye but his would ever see his shame.,846
3688,"On reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock and that the tea had been already brought up.",847
3689,"On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled.",847
3690,A copy of the third edition of _The St. James’s Gazette_ had been placed on the tea-tray.,847
3691,It was evident that Victor had returned.,847
3692,He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.,847
3693,"He would be sure to miss the picture—had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying the tea-things.",847
3694,"The screen had not been set back, and a blank space was visible on the wall.",847
3695,Perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room.,847
3696,It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one’s house.,847
3697,"He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace.",847
3698,"He sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s note.",848
3699,"It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper, and a book that might interest him, and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen.",848
3700,"He opened _The St. James’s_ languidly, and looked through it.",848
3701,A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye.,848
3702,It drew attention to the following paragraph:,848
3703,"INQUEST ON AN ACTRESS.—An inquest was held this morning at the Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre, Holborn.",849
3704,A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.,849
3705,"Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.",849
3706," He frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and flung the pieces away.",850
3707,How ugly it all was!,850
3708,And how horribly real ugliness made things!,850
3709,He felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him the report.,850
3710,And it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil.,850
3711,Victor might have read it.,850
3712,The man knew more than enough English for that.,850
3713,Perhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something.,851
3714,"And, yet, what did it matter?",851
3715,What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death?,851
3716,There was nothing to fear.,851
3717,Dorian Gray had not killed her.,851
3718,His eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him.,852
3719,"What was it, he wondered.",852
3720,"He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves.",852
3721,After a few minutes he became absorbed.,852
3722,It was the strangest book that he had ever read.,852
3723,"It seemed to him that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him.",852
3724,Things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him.,852
3725,Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed.,852
3726,"It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin.",853
3727,"The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of _argot_ and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of _Symbolistes_.",853
3728,There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour.,853
3729,The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy.,853
3730,One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.,853
3731,It was a poisonous book.,853
3732,The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.,853
3733,"The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.",853
3734,"Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed through the windows.",854
3735,He read on by its wan light till he could read no more.,854
3736,"Then, after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour, he got up, and going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner.",854
3737,"It was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.",855
3738,"“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely your fault.",856
3739,That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going.”,856
3740,"“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from his chair.",857
3741,"“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry.",858
3742,I said it fascinated me.,858
3743,There is a great difference.”,858
3744,"“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry.",859
3745,And they passed into the dining-room.,859
3746, CHAPTER XI.,861
3747," For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book.",862
3748,Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it.,862
3749,"He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control.",862
3750,"The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself.",862
3751,"And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life, written before he had lived it.",862
3752,In one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero.,863
3753,"He never knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable.",863
3754,"It was with an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he had most dearly valued.",863
3755,"For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him.",864
3756,Even those who had heard the most evil things against him—and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs—could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him.,864
3757,He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world.,864
3758,Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.,864
3759,There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them.,864
3760,His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.,864
3761,They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.,864
3762,"Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass.",865
3763,The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure.,865
3764,"He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul.",865
3765,"He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.",865
3766,"He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.",865
3767,He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.,865
3768,"There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish.",866
3769,But moments such as these were rare.,866
3770,"That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification.",866
3771,"The more he knew, the more he desired to know.",866
3772,He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.,866
3773,"Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society.",867
3774,"Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art.",867
3775,"His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.",867
3776,"Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world.",867
3777,"To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to “make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like Gautier, he was one for whom “the visible world existed.”",867
3778,"And, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.",868
3779,"Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him.",868
3780,"His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.",868
3781,"For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere _arbiter elegantiarum_, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane.",869
3782,"He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.",869
3783,"The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.",870
3784,"But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.",870
3785,"As he looked back upon man moving through history, he was haunted by a feeling of loss.",870
3786,So much had been surrendered!,870
3787,and to such little purpose!,870
3788,"There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.",870
3789,"Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.",871
3790,"It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience.",871
3791,"Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.",871
3792,"Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.",871
3793,But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.,871
3794,"There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.",872
3795,"Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble.",872
3796,"In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.",872
3797,"Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave.",872
3798,"Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.",872
3799,The wan mirrors get back their mimic life.,872
3800,"The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.",872
3801,Nothing seems to us changed.,872
3802,Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.,872
3803,"We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.",872
3804,"It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.",873
3805,"It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him.",874
3806,"The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize.",874
3807,"He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the “_panis cælestis_,” the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins.",874
3808,"The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him.",874
3809,"As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.",874
3810,"But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.",875
3811,"Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the _Darwinismus_ movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.",875
3812,"Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself.",875
3813,He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment.,875
3814,"He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.",875
3815,"And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East.",876
3816,"He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.",876
3817,"At another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.",877
3818,"The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and Chopin’s beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his ear.",877
3819,"He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them.",877
3820,"He had the mysterious _juruparis_ of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness.",877
3821,"He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long _clarin_ of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh _ture_ of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the _teponaztli_, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the _yotl_-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description.",877
3822,"The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.",877
3823,"Yet, after some time, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to “Tannhauser” and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul.",877
3824,"On one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls.",878
3825,"This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him.",878
3826,"He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.",878
3827,"He loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal.",878
3828,"He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise _de la vieille roche_ that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.",878
3829,"He discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.",879
3830,"In Alphonso’s Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes “with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.” There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and “by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe” the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain.",879
3831,"According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent.",879
3832,"The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine.",879
3833,"The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her colour.",879
3834,"The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.",879
3835,"Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.",879
3836,"The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague.",879
3837,"In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any danger by fire.",879
3838,"The King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the ceremony of his coronation.",880
3839,"The gates of the palace of John the Priest were “made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.” Over the gable were “two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night.",880
3840,"In Lodge’s strange romance ‘A Margarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold “all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead.",880

3853,How exquisite life had once been!,882
3854,How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration!,882
3855,Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.,882
3856,Then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe.,883
3857,As he investigated the subject—and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.,883
3858,"He, at any rate, had escaped that.",883
3859,"Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged.",883
3860,No winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom.,883
3861,How different it was with material things!,883
3862,Where had they passed to?,883
3863,"Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?",883
3864,"Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?",883
3865,"He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature”; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “_Madame, je suis tout joyeux_,” the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls.",883
3866,"He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.",883
3867,"Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.",883

3872,"It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.",883
3873,"And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as “woven air,” and “running water,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with _fleurs-de-lis_, birds and images; veils of _lacis_ worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese _Foukousas_, with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.",884
3874,"He had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the Church.",885
3875,"In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain.",885
3876,"He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls.",885
3877,"The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.",885
3878,This was Italian work of the fifteenth century.,885

3880,The morse bore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work.,885
3881,"The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.",885
3882,"He had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and _fleurs-de-lis_; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.",885
3883,"In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his imagination.",885
3884,"For these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were to be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne.",886
3885,"Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.",886
3886,"For weeks he would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart, his wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence.",886
3887,"Then, suddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away.",886
3888,"On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own.",886
3889,"After a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter.",887
3890,"He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life, and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door.",887
3891,He was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.,888
3892,"It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that?",888
3893,He would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him.,888
3894,He had not painted it.,888
3895,What was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked?,888
3896,"Even if he told them, would they believe it?",888
3897,Yet he was afraid.,889
3898,"Sometimes when he was down at his great house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.",889
3899,What if it should be stolen?,889
3900,The mere thought made him cold with horror.,889
3901,Surely the world would know his secret then.,889
3902,Perhaps the world already suspected it.,889
3903,"For, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him.",890
3904,"He was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.",890
3905,Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twenty-fifth year.,890
3906,"It was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.",890
3907,"His extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer, or look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to discover his secret.",890
3908,"Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him.",891
3909,"It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him.",891
3910,"Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.",891
3911,Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm.,892
3912,His great wealth was a certain element of security.,892
3913,"Society—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating.",892
3914,"It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good _chef_.",892
3915,"And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life.",892
3916,"Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold _entrées_, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view.",892
3917,"For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.",892
3918,Form is absolutely essential to it.,892
3919,"It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.",892
3920,Is insincerity such a terrible thing?,892
3921,I think not.,892
3922,It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.,892
3923,"Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion.",893
3924,"He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.",893
3925,"To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.",893
3926,He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins.,893
3927,"Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome face, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life that he sometimes led?",893
3928,Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own?,893
3929,"Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life?",893
3930,"Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled at his feet.",893
3931,What had this man’s legacy been?,893
3932,Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame?,893
3933,Were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize?,893
3934,"Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.",893

3936,On a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple.,893

3939,Had he something of her temperament in him?,893
3940,"These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him.",893
3941,"What of George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and fantastic patches?",893
3942,How evil he looked!,893
3943,"The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.",893
3944,Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings.,893
3945,"He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.",893
3946,"What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert?",893
3947,"How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent pose!",893
3948,What passions had he bequeathed?,893
3949,The world had looked upon him as infamous.,893
3950,He had led the orgies at Carlton House.,893
3951,The star of the Garter glittered upon his breast.,893
3952,"Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.",893
3953,"Her blood, also, stirred within him.",893
3954,How curious it all seemed!,893
3955,"And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face and her moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got from her.",893
3956,"He had got from her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others.",893
3957,She laughed at him in her loose Bacchante dress.,893
3958,There were vine leaves in her hair.,893
3959,The purple spilled from the cup she was holding.,893
3960,"The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour.",893
3961,They seemed to follow him wherever he went.,893
3962,"Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.",894
3963,"There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life, not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions.",894
3964,"He felt that he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety.",894
3965,It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own.,894
3966,The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy.,895
3967,"In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible _tædium vitæ_, that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.",895
3968,"Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had sickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.",896
3969,There was a horrible fascination in them all.,897
3970,"He saw them at night, and they troubled his imagination in the day.",897
3971,"The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning—poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain.",897
3972,Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.,897
3973,There were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful.,897
3974, CHAPTER XII.,899
3975," It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth birthday, as he often remembered afterwards.",900
3976,"He was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where he had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold and foggy.",901
3977,"At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed him in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up.",901
3978,He had a bag in his hand.,901
3979,Dorian recognized him.,901
3980,It was Basil Hallward.,901
3981,"A strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over him.",901
3982,He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house.,901
3983,But Hallward had seen him.,902
3984,Dorian heard him first stopping on the pavement and then hurrying after him.,902
3985,"In a few moments, his hand was on his arm.",902
3986,“Dorian!,903
3987,What an extraordinary piece of luck!,903
3988,I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o’clock.,903
3989,"Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out.",903
3990,"I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left.",903
3991,"I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me.",903
3992,But I wasn’t quite sure.,903
3993,Didn’t you recognize me?”,903
3994,"“In this fog, my dear Basil?",904
3995,"Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor Square.",904
3996,"I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at all certain about it.",904
3997,"I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages.",904
3998,But I suppose you will be back soon?”,904
3999,“No: I am going to be out of England for six months.,905
4000,I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head.,905
4001,"However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk.",905
4002,Here we are at your door.,905
4003,Let me come in for a moment.,905
4004,I have something to say to you.”,905
4005,“I shall be charmed.,906
4006,But won’t you miss your train?” said Dorian Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his latch-key.,906
4007,"The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch.",907
4008,"“I have heaps of time,” he answered.",907
4009,"“The train doesn’t go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven.",907
4010,"In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you.",907
4011,"You see, I shan’t have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things.",907
4012,"All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”",907
4013,Dorian looked at him and smiled.,908
4014,“What a way for a fashionable painter to travel!,908
4015,A Gladstone bag and an ulster!,908
4016,"Come in, or the fog will get into the house.",908
4017,And mind you don’t talk about anything serious.,908
4018,Nothing is serious nowadays.,908
4019,At least nothing should be.”,908
4020,"Hallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the library.",909
4021,There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.,909
4022,"The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.",909
4023,"“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian.",910
4024,"He gave me everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes.",910
4025,He is a most hospitable creature.,910
4026,I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have.,910
4027,"What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”",910
4028,Dorian shrugged his shoulders.,911
4029,"“I believe he married Lady Radley’s maid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.",911
4030,"_Anglomanie_ is very fashionable over there now, I hear.",911
4031,"It seems silly of the French, doesn’t it?",911
4032,But—do you know?—he was not at all a bad servant.,911
4033,"I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about.",911
4034,One often imagines things that are quite absurd.,911
4035,He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away.,911
4036,Have another brandy-and-soda?,911
4037,Or would you like hock-and-seltzer?,911
4038,I always take hock-and-seltzer myself.,911
4039,There is sure to be some in the next room.”,911
4040,"“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter, taking his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner.",912
4041,"“And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.",912
4042,Don’t frown like that.,912
4043,You make it so much more difficult for me.”,912
4044,"“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa.",913
4045,“I hope it is not about myself.,913
4046,I am tired of myself to-night.,913
4047,I should like to be somebody else.”,913
4048,"“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice, “and I must say it to you.",914
4049,I shall only keep you half an hour.”,914
4050,Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette.,915
4051,“Half an hour!” he murmured.,915
4052,"“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking.",916
4053,I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London.”,916
4054,“I don’t wish to know anything about them.,917
4055,"I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me.",917
4056,They have not got the charm of novelty.”,917
4057,"“They must interest you, Dorian.",918
4058,Every gentleman is interested in his good name.,918
4059,You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded.,918
4060,"Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing.",918
4061,But position and wealth are not everything.,918
4062,"Mind you, I don’t believe these rumours at all.",918
4063,"At least, I can’t believe them when I see you.",918
4064,Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s face.,918
4065,It cannot be concealed.,918
4066,People talk sometimes of secret vices.,918
4067,There are no such things.,918
4068,"If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even.",918
4069,"Somebody—I won’t mention his name, but you know him—came to me last year to have his portrait done.",918
4070,"I had never seen him before, and had never heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a good deal since.",918
4071,He offered an extravagant price.,918
4072,I refused him.,918
4073,There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated.,918
4074,I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.,918
4075,His life is dreadful.,918
4076,"But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything against you.",918
4077,"And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you, I don’t know what to say.",918
4078,"Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?",918
4079,Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs?,918
4080,You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley.,918
4081,I met him at dinner last week.,918
4082,"Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley.",918
4083,"Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with.",918
4084,"I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.",918
4085,He told me.,918
4086,He told me right out before everybody.,918
4087,It was horrible!,918
4088,Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?,918
4089,There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.,918
4090,You were his great friend.,918
4091,"There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.",918
4092,You and he were inseparable.,918
4093,What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end?,918
4094,What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career?,918
4095,I met his father yesterday in St. James’s Street.,918
4096,He seemed broken with shame and sorrow.,918
4097,What about the young Duke of Perth?,918
4098,What sort of life has he got now?,918
4099,What gentleman would associate with him?”,918
4100,"“Stop, Basil.",919
4101,"You are talking about things of which you know nothing,” said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite contempt in his voice.",919
4102,“You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it.,919
4103,"It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows anything about mine.",919
4104,"With such blood as he has in his veins, how could his record be clean?",919
4105,You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.,919
4106,"Did I teach the one his vices, and the other his debauchery?",919
4107,"If Kent’s silly son takes his wife from the streets, what is that to me?",919
4108,"If Adrian Singleton writes his friend’s name across a bill, am I his keeper?",919
4109,I know how people chatter in England.,919
4110,"The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander.",919
4111,"In this country, it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him.",919
4112,"And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves?",919
4113,"My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.”",919
4114,"“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question.",920
4115,"England is bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong.",920
4116,That is the reason why I want you to be fine.,920
4117,You have not been fine.,920
4118,One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends.,920
4119,"Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity.",920
4120,You have filled them with a madness for pleasure.,920
4121,They have gone down into the depths.,920
4122,You led them there.,920
4123,"Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now.",920
4124,And there is worse behind.,920
4125,I know you and Harry are inseparable.,920
4126,"Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not have made his sister’s name a by-word.”",920
4127,"“Take care, Basil.",921
4128,You go too far.”,921
4129,"“I must speak, and you must listen.",922
4130,You shall listen.,922
4131,"When you met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her.",922
4132,Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park?,922
4133,"Why, even her children are not allowed to live with her.",922
4134,Then there are other stories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London.,922
4135,Are they true?,922
4136,Can they be true?,922
4137,"When I first heard them, I laughed.",922
4138,"I hear them now, and they make me shudder.",922
4139,What about your country-house and the life that is led there?,922
4140,"Dorian, you don’t know what is said about you.",922
4141,I won’t tell you that I don’t want to preach to you.,922
4142,"I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then proceeded to break his word.",922
4143,I do want to preach to you.,922
4144,I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you.,922
4145,I want you to have a clean name and a fair record.,922
4146,I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with.,922
4147,Don’t shrug your shoulders like that.,922
4148,Don’t be so indifferent.,922
4149,You have a wonderful influence.,922
4150,"Let it be for good, not for evil.",922
4151,"They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after.",922
4152,I don’t know whether it is so or not.,922
4153,How should I know?,922
4154,But it is said of you.,922
4155,I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.,922
4156,Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford.,922
4157,He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone.,922
4158,Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read.,922
4159,"I told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly, and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.",922
4160,Know you?,922
4161,I wonder do I know you?,922
4162,"Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”",922
4163,"“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear.",923
4164,"“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his voice, “to see your soul.",924
4165,But only God can do that.”,924
4166,A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man.,925
4167,"“You shall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the table.",925
4168,“Come: it is your own handiwork.,925
4169,Why shouldn’t you look at it?,925
4170,"You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose.",925
4171,Nobody would believe you.,925
4172,"If they did believe you, they would like me all the better for it.",925
4173,"I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously.",925
4174,"Come, I tell you.",925
4175,You have chattered enough about corruption.,925
4176,Now you shall look on it face to face.”,925
4177,There was the madness of pride in every word he uttered.,926
4178,He stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner.,926
4179,"He felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done.",926
4180,"“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly into his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul.",927
4181,You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see.”,927
4182,Hallward started back.,928
4183,"“This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried.",928
4184,“You must not say things like that.,928
4185,"They are horrible, and they don’t mean anything.”",928
4186,“You think so?” He laughed again.,929
4187,“I know so.,930
4188,"As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good.",930
4189,You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”,930
4190,“Don’t touch me.,931
4191,Finish what you have to say.”,931
4192,A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face.,932
4193,"He paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him.",932
4194,"After all, what right had he to pry into the life of Dorian Gray?",932
4195,"If he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him, how much he must have suffered!",932
4196,"Then he straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.",932
4197,"“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.",933
4198,He turned round.,934
4199,"“What I have to say is this,” he cried.",934
4200,“You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you.,934
4201,"If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I shall believe you.",934
4202,"Deny them, Dorian, deny them!",934
4203,Can’t you see what I am going through?,934
4204,My God!,934
4205,"don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt, and shameful.”",934
4206,Dorian Gray smiled.,935
4207,There was a curl of contempt in his lips.,935
4208,"“Come upstairs, Basil,” he said quietly.",935
4209,"“I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.",935
4210,I shall show it to you if you come with me.”,935
4211,"“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.",936
4212,I see I have missed my train.,936
4213,That makes no matter.,936
4214,I can go to-morrow.,936
4215,But don’t ask me to read anything to-night.,936
4216,All I want is a plain answer to my question.”,936
4217,“That shall be given to you upstairs.,937
4218,I could not give it here.,937
4219,You will not have to read long.”,937
4220, CHAPTER XIII.,939
4221," He passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close behind.",940
4222,"They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night.",940
4223,The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase.,940
4224,A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.,940
4225,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock.",941
4226,"“You insist on knowing, Basil?” he asked in a low voice.",941
4227,“Yes.”,942
4228,"“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling.",943
4229,"Then he added, somewhat harshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me.",943
4230,"You have had more to do with my life than you think”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.",943
4231,"A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange.",943
4232,He shuddered.,943
4233,"“Shut the door behind you,” he whispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.",943
4234,Hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression.,944
4235,The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years.,944
4236,"A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian _cassone_, and an almost empty book-case—that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table.",944
4237,"As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes.",944
4238,A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting.,944
4239,There was a damp odour of mildew.,944
4240,"“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil?",945
4241,"Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine.”",945
4242,The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.,946
4243,"“You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.",946
4244,“You won’t?,947
4245,"Then I must do it myself,” said the young man, and he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.",947
4246,An exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him.,948
4247,There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing.,948
4248,Good heavens!,948
4249,it was Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at!,948
4250,"The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty.",948
4251,There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth.,948
4252,"The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat.",948
4253,"Yes, it was Dorian himself.",948
4254,But who had done it?,948
4255,"He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design.",948
4256,"The idea was monstrous, yet he felt afraid.",948
4257,"He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture.",948
4258,"In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.",948
4259,"It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire.",949
4260,He had never done that.,949
4261,"Still, it was his own picture.",949
4262,"He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice.",949
4263,His own picture!,949
4264,What did it mean?,949
4265,Why had it altered?,949
4266,He turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.,949
4267,"His mouth twitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate.",949
4268,He passed his hand across his forehead.,949
4269,It was dank with clammy sweat.,949
4270,"The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting.",950
4271,There was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy.,950
4272,"There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes.",950
4273,"He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.",950
4274,"“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last.",951
4275,His own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears.,951
4276,"“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks.",952
4277,"One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty.",952
4278,"In a mad moment that, even now, I don’t know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer....”",952
4279,“I remember it!,953
4280,"Oh, how well I remember it!",953
4281,No!,953
4282,the thing is impossible.,953
4283,The room is damp.,953
4284,Mildew has got into the canvas.,953
4285,The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.,953
4286,I tell you the thing is impossible.”,953
4287,"“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the window and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.",954
4288,“You told me you had destroyed it.”,955
4289,“I was wrong.,956
4290,It has destroyed me.”,956
4291,“I don’t believe it is my picture.”,957
4292,“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.,958
4293,"“My ideal, as you call it...”",959
4294,“As you called it.”,960
4295,"“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.",961
4296,You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again.,961
4297,This is the face of a satyr.”,961
4298,“It is the face of my soul.”,962
4299,“Christ!,963
4300,what a thing I must have worshipped!,963
4301,It has the eyes of a devil.”,963
4302,"“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a wild gesture of despair.",964
4303,Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it.,965
4304,“My God!,965
4305,"If it is true,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it.",965
4306,The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it.,965
4307,"It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.",965
4308,Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away.,965
4309,The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.,965
4310,"His hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering.",966
4311,He placed his foot on it and put it out.,966
4312,Then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands.,966
4313,"“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson!",967
4314,"What an awful lesson!” There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window.",967
4315,"“Pray, Dorian, pray,” he murmured.",967
4316,“What is it that one was taught to say in one’s boyhood?,967
4317,‘Lead us not into temptation.,967
4318,Forgive us our sins.,967
4319,Wash away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together.,967
4320,The prayer of your pride has been answered.,967
4321,The prayer of your repentance will be answered also.,967
4322,I worshipped you too much.,967
4323,I am punished for it.,967
4324,You worshipped yourself too much.,967
4325,We are both punished.”,967
4326,Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes.,968
4327,"“It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.",968
4328,"“It is never too late, Dorian.",969
4329,Let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer.,969
4330,"Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”",969
4331,“Those words mean nothing to me now.”,970
4332,“Hush!,971
4333,Don’t say that.,971
4334,You have done enough evil in your life.,971
4335,My God!,971
4336,Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”,971
4337,"Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had been suggested to him by the image on the canvas, whispered into his ear by those grinning lips.",972
4338,"The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who was seated at the table, more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything.",972
4339,He glanced wildly around.,972
4340,Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him.,972
4341,His eye fell on it.,972
4342,He knew what it was.,972
4343,"It was a knife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him.",972
4344,"He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he did so.",972
4345,"As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and turned round.",972
4346,Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise.,972
4347,"He rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man’s head down on the table and stabbing again and again.",972
4348,There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood.,973
4349,"Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively, waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air.",973
4350,"He stabbed him twice more, but the man did not move.",973
4351,Something began to trickle on the floor.,973
4352,"He waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.",973
4353,"Then he threw the knife on the table, and listened.",973
4354,"He could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.",974
4355,He opened the door and went out on the landing.,974
4356,The house was absolutely quiet.,974
4357,No one was about.,974
4358,For a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.,974
4359,"Then he took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in as he did so.",974
4360,"The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.",975
4361,"Had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.",975
4362,How quickly it had all been done!,976
4363,"He felt strangely calm, and walking over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony.",976
4364,"The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.",976
4365,He looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses.,976
4366,The crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished.,976
4367,"A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she went.",976
4368,Now and then she stopped and peered back.,976
4369,"Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice.",976
4370,The policeman strolled over and said something to her.,976
4371,"She stumbled away, laughing.",976
4372,A bitter blast swept across the square.,976
4373,"The gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro.",976
4374,"He shivered and went back, closing the window behind him.",976
4375,"Having reached the door, he turned the key and opened it.",977
4376,He did not even glance at the murdered man.,977
4377,He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation.,977
4378,The friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his life.,977
4379,That was enough.,977
4380,Then he remembered the lamp.,978
4381,"It was a rather curious one of Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.",978
4382,"Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and questions would be asked.",978
4383,"He hesitated for a moment, then he turned back and took it from the table.",978
4384,He could not help seeing the dead thing.,978
4385,How still it was!,978
4386,How horribly white the long hands looked!,978
4387,It was like a dreadful wax image.,978
4388,"Having locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs.",979
4389,The woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain.,979
4390,He stopped several times and waited.,979
4391,No: everything was still.,979
4392,It was merely the sound of his own footsteps.,979
4393,"When he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner.",980
4394,They must be hidden away somewhere.,980
4395,"He unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises, and put them into it.",980
4396,He could easily burn them afterwards.,980
4397,Then he pulled out his watch.,980
4398,It was twenty minutes to two.,980
4399,He sat down and began to think.,981
4400,"Every year—every month, almost—men were strangled in England for what he had done.",981
4401,There had been a madness of murder in the air.,981
4402,"Some red star had come too close to the earth.... And yet, what evidence was there against him?",981
4403,Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.,981
4404,No one had seen him come in again.,981
4405,Most of the servants were at Selby Royal.,981
4406,His valet had gone to bed.... Paris!,981
4407,Yes.,981
4408,"It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he had intended.",981
4409,"With his curious reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be roused.",981
4410,Months!,981
4411,Everything could be destroyed long before then.,981
4412,A sudden thought struck him.,982
4413,He put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the hall.,982
4414,"There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull’s-eye reflected in the window.",982
4415,He waited and held his breath.,982
4416,"After a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting the door very gently behind him.",983
4417,Then he began ringing the bell.,983
4418,"In about five minutes his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy.",983
4419,"“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping in; “but I had forgotten my latch-key.",984
4420,What time is it?”,984
4421,"“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock and blinking.",985
4422,“Ten minutes past two?,986
4423,How horribly late!,986
4424,You must wake me at nine to-morrow.,986
4425,I have some work to do.”,986
4426,"“All right, sir.”",987
4427,“Did any one call this evening?”,988
4428,“Mr.,989
4429,"Hallward, sir.",989
4430,"He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to catch his train.”",989
4431,“Oh!,990
4432,I am sorry I didn’t see him.,990
4433,Did he leave any message?”,990
4434,"“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not find you at the club.”",991
4435,"“That will do, Francis.",992
4436,Don’t forget to call me at nine to-morrow.”,992
4437,"“No, sir.”",993
4438,The man shambled down the passage in his slippers.,994
4439,Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library.,995
4440,"For a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room, biting his lip and thinking.",995
4441,Then he took down the Blue Book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves.,995
4442,"“Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.",995
4443, CHAPTER XIV.,997
4444, At nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.,998
4445,"Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek.",998
4446,"He looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.",998
4447,"The man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been lost in some delightful dream.",999
4448,Yet he had not dreamed at all.,999
4449,His night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain.,999
4450,But youth smiles without any reason.,999
4451,It is one of its chiefest charms.,999
4452,"He turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate.",1000
4453,The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.,1000
4454,"The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air.",1000
4455,It was almost like a morning in May.,1000
4456,"Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness.",1001
4457,"He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion.",1001
4458,"The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.",1001
4459,How horrible that was!,1001
4460,"Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.",1001
4461,He felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad.,1002
4462,"There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.",1002
4463,But this was not one of them.,1002
4464,"It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.",1002
4465,"When the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing his rings more than once.",1003
4466,"He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.",1003
4467,"At some of the letters, he smiled.",1003
4468,Three of them bored him.,1003
4469,One he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face.,1003
4470,"“That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry had once said.",1003
4471,"After he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly with a napkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters.",1004
4472,"One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the valet.",1004
4473,"“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address.”",1005
4474,"As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.",1006
4475,Suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward.,1006
4476,"He frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.",1006
4477,He was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so.,1006
4478,"When he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the book.",1007
4479,"It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.",1007
4480,"The binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates.",1007
4481,It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.,1007
4482,"As he turned over the pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand “_du supplice encore mal lavée_,” with its downy red hairs and its “_doigts de faune_.” He glanced at his own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:",1007
4483,"Sur une gamme chromatique,     Le sein de perles ruisselant, La Vénus de l’Adriatique     Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.",1008
4484,"Les dômes, sur l’azur des ondes     Suivant la phrase au pur contour, S’enflent comme des gorges rondes     Que soulève un soupir d’amour.",1009
4485,"L’esquif aborde et me dépose,     Jetant son amarre au pilier, Devant une façade rose,     Sur le marbre d’un escalier.",1010
4486, How exquisite they were!,1011
4487,"As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.",1011
4488,The mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.,1011
4489,"The sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades.",1011
4490,"Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:",1011
4491,"“Devant une façade rose, Sur le marbre d’un escalier.”",1012
4492, The whole of Venice was in those two lines.,1013
4493,"He remembered the autumn that he had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies.",1013
4494,There was romance in every place.,1013
4495,"But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.",1013
4496,"Basil had been with him part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.",1013
4497,Poor Basil!,1013
4498,What a horrible way for a man to die!,1013
4499,"He sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.",1014
4500,"He read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little _café_ at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the “_monstre charmant_” that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.",1014
4501,But after a time the book fell from his hand.,1014
4502,"He grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him.",1014
4503,What if Alan Campbell should be out of England?,1014
4504,Days would elapse before he could come back.,1014
4505,Perhaps he might refuse to come.,1014
4506,What could he do then?,1014
4507,Every moment was of vital importance.,1014
4508,"They had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable, indeed.",1015
4509,Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end.,1015
4510,"When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never did.",1015
4511,"He was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from Dorian.",1016
4512,His dominant intellectual passion was for science.,1016
4513,"At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his year.",1016
4514,"Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions.",1016
4515,"He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.",1016
4516,"In fact, it was music that had first brought him and Dorian Gray together—music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wished—and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it.",1016
4517,"They had met at Lady Berkshire’s the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.",1016
4518,For eighteen months their intimacy lasted.,1016
4519,Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.,1016
4520,"To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.",1016
4521,Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew.,1016
4522,But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present.,1016
4523,"He had changed, too—was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his excuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise.",1016
4524,And this was certainly true.,1016
4525,"Every day he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments.",1016
4526,This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.,1017
4527,Every second he kept glancing at the clock.,1017
4528,As the minutes went by he became horribly agitated.,1017
4529,"At last he got up and began to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing.",1017
4530,He took long stealthy strides.,1017
4531,His hands were curiously cold.,1017
4532,The suspense became unbearable.,1018
4533,"Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of lead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.",1018
4534,"He knew what was waiting for him there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.",1018
4535,It was useless.,1018
4536,"The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks.",1018
4537,"Then, suddenly, time stopped for him.",1018
4538,"Yes: that blind, slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him.",1018
4539,He stared at it.,1018
4540,Its very horror made him stone.,1018
4541,At last the door opened and his servant entered.,1019
4542,He turned glazed eyes upon him.,1019
4543,“Mr.,1020
4544,"Campbell, sir,” said the man.",1020
4545,"A sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his cheeks.",1021
4546,"“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself again.",1022
4547,His mood of cowardice had passed away.,1022
4548,The man bowed and retired.,1023
4549,"In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.",1023
4550,“Alan!,1024
4551,This is kind of you.,1024
4552,I thank you for coming.”,1024
4553,"“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.",1025
4554,But you said it was a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold.,1025
4555,He spoke with slow deliberation.,1025
4556,There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on Dorian.,1025
4557,"He kept his hands in the pockets of his Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted.",1025
4558,"“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.",1026
4559,Sit down.”,1026
4560,"Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him.",1027
4561,The two men’s eyes met.,1027
4562,In Dorian’s there was infinite pity.,1027
4563,He knew that what he was going to do was dreadful.,1027
4564,"After a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for, “Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.",1028
4565,He has been dead ten hours now.,1028
4566,"Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like that.",1028
4567,"Who the man is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you.",1028
4568,What you have to do is this—”,1028
4569,"“Stop, Gray.",1029
4570,I don’t want to know anything further.,1029
4571,Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me.,1029
4572,I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life.,1029
4573,Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.,1029
4574,They don’t interest me any more.”,1029
4575,"“Alan, they will have to interest you.",1030
4576,This one will have to interest you.,1030
4577,"I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.",1030
4578,But I can’t help myself.,1030
4579,You are the one man who is able to save me.,1030
4580,I am forced to bring you into the matter.,1030
4581,I have no option.,1030
4582,"Alan, you are scientific.",1030
4583,You know about chemistry and things of that kind.,1030
4584,You have made experiments.,1030
4585,What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs—to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.,1030
4586,Nobody saw this person come into the house.,1030
4587,"Indeed, at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris.",1030
4588,He will not be missed for months.,1030
4589,"When he is missed, there must be no trace of him found here.",1030
4590,"You, Alan, you must change him, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air.”",1030
4591,"“You are mad, Dorian.”",1031
4592,“Ah!,1032
4593,I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”,1032
4594,"“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.",1033
4595,"I will have nothing to do with this matter, whatever it is.",1033
4596,Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you?,1033
4597,What is it to me what devil’s work you are up to?”,1033
4598,"“It was suicide, Alan.”",1034
4599,“I am glad of that.,1035
4600,But who drove him to it?,1035
4601,"You, I should fancy.”",1035
4602,“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”,1036
4603,“Of course I refuse.,1037
4604,I will have absolutely nothing to do with it.,1037
4605,I don’t care what shame comes on you.,1037
4606,You deserve it all.,1037
4607,"I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced.",1037
4608,"How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?",1037
4609,I should have thought you knew more about people’s characters.,1037
4610,"Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can’t have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you.",1037
4611,Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you.,1037
4612,You have come to the wrong man.,1037
4613,Go to some of your friends.,1037
4614,Don’t come to me.”,1037
4615,"“Alan, it was murder.",1038
4616,I killed him.,1038
4617,You don’t know what he had made me suffer.,1038
4618,"Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had.",1038
4619,"He may not have intended it, the result was the same.”",1038
4620,“Murder!,1039
4621,"Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?",1039
4622,I shall not inform upon you.,1039
4623,It is not my business.,1039
4624,"Besides, without my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested.",1039
4625,Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid.,1039
4626,But I will have nothing to do with it.”,1039
4627,“You must have something to do with it.,1040
4628,"Wait, wait a moment; listen to me.",1040
4629,"Only listen, Alan.",1040
4630,All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.,1040
4631,"You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don’t affect you.",1040
4632,"If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject.",1040
4633,You would not turn a hair.,1040
4634,You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong.,1040
4635,"On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.",1040
4636,What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.,1040
4637,"Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at.",1040
4638,"And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.",1040
4639,"If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.”",1040
4640,“I have no desire to help you.,1041
4641,You forget that.,1041
4642,I am simply indifferent to the whole thing.,1041
4643,It has nothing to do with me.”,1041
4644,"“Alan, I entreat you.",1042
4645,Think of the position I am in.,1042
4646,Just before you came I almost fainted with terror.,1042
4647,You may know terror yourself some day.,1042
4648,No!,1042
4649,don’t think of that.,1042
4650,Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view.,1042
4651,You don’t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from.,1042
4652,Don’t inquire now.,1042
4653,I have told you too much as it is.,1042
4654,But I beg of you to do this.,1042
4655,"We were friends once, Alan.”",1042
4656,"“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian—they are dead.”",1043
4657,“The dead linger sometimes.,1044
4658,The man upstairs will not go away.,1044
4659,He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms.,1044
4660,Alan!,1044
4661,Alan!,1044
4662,"If you don’t come to my assistance, I am ruined.",1044
4663,"Why, they will hang me, Alan!",1044
4664,Don’t you understand?,1044
4665,They will hang me for what I have done.”,1044
4666,“There is no good in prolonging this scene.,1045
4667,I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter.,1045
4668,It is insane of you to ask me.”,1045
4669,“You refuse?”,1046
4670,“Yes.”,1047
4671,"“I entreat you, Alan.”",1048
4672,“It is useless.”,1049
4673,The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes.,1050
4674,"Then he stretched out his hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.",1050
4675,"He read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.",1050
4676,"Having done this, he got up and went over to the window.",1050
4677,"Campbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it.",1051
4678,"As he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair.",1051
4679,A horrible sense of sickness came over him.,1051
4680,He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow.,1051
4681,"After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and came and stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.",1052
4682,"“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me no alternative.",1053
4683,I have a letter written already.,1053
4684,Here it is.,1053
4685,You see the address.,1053
4686,"If you don’t help me, I must send it.",1053
4687,"If you don’t help me, I will send it.",1053
4688,You know what the result will be.,1053
4689,But you are going to help me.,1053
4690,It is impossible for you to refuse now.,1053
4691,I tried to spare you.,1053
4692,You will do me the justice to admit that.,1053
4693,"You were stern, harsh, offensive.",1053
4694,"You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me—no living man, at any rate.",1053
4695,I bore it all.,1053
4696,Now it is for me to dictate terms.”,1053
4697,"Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.",1054
4698,"“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan.",1055
4699,You know what they are.,1055
4700,The thing is quite simple.,1055
4701,"Come, don’t work yourself into this fever.",1055
4702,The thing has to be done.,1055
4703,"Face it, and do it.”",1055
4704,A groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over.,1056
4705,"The ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne.",1056
4706,"He felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him.",1056
4707,The hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead.,1056
4708,It was intolerable.,1056
4709,It seemed to crush him.,1056
4710,"“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”",1057
4711,"“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could alter things.",1058
4712,“You must.,1059
4713,You have no choice.,1059
4714,Don’t delay.”,1059
4715,He hesitated a moment.,1060
4716,“Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”,1060
4717,"“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”",1061
4718,“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”,1062
4719,"“No, Alan, you must not leave the house.",1063
4720,Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you.”,1063
4721,"Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his assistant.",1064
4722,Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.,1064
4723,"Then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him.",1064
4724,"As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece.",1065
4725,He was shivering with a kind of ague.,1065
4726,"For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke.",1065
4727,"A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.",1065
4728,"As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.",1066
4729,There was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him.,1066
4730,"“You are infamous, absolutely infamous!” he muttered.",1066
4731,"“Hush, Alan.",1067
4732,"You have saved my life,” said Dorian.",1067
4733,“Your life?,1068
4734,Good heavens!,1068
4735,what a life that is!,1068
4736,"You have gone from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.",1068
4737,In doing what I am going to do—what you force me to do—it is not of your life that I am thinking.”,1068
4738,"“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away as he spoke and stood looking out at the garden.",1069
4739,Campbell made no answer.,1069
4740,"After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.",1070
4741,"“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.",1071
4742,"“Yes,” said Dorian.",1072
4743,"“And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another errand for you.",1072
4744,What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids?”,1072
4745,"“Harden, sir.”",1073
4746,“Yes—Harden.,1074
4747,"You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden personally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible.",1074
4748,"In fact, I don’t want any white ones.",1074
4749,"It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty place—otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”",1074
4750,"“No trouble, sir.",1075
4751,At what time shall I be back?”,1075
4752,Dorian looked at Campbell.,1076
4753,"“How long will your experiment take, Alan?” he said in a calm indifferent voice.",1076
4754,The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.,1076
4755,Campbell frowned and bit his lip.,1077
4756,"“It will take about five hours,” he answered.",1077
4757,"“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, Francis.",1078
4758,Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing.,1078
4759,You can have the evening to yourself.,1078
4760,"I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you.”",1078
4761,"“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.",1079
4762,"“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost.",1080
4763,How heavy this chest is!,1080
4764,I’ll take it for you.,1080
4765,You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner.,1080
4766,Campbell felt dominated by him.,1080
4767,They left the room together.,1080
4768,"When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.",1081
4769,"Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his eyes.",1081
4770,He shuddered.,1081
4771,"“I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.",1081
4772,“It is nothing to me.,1082
4773,"I don’t require you,” said Campbell coldly.",1082
4774,Dorian half opened the door.,1083
4775,"As he did so, he saw the face of his portrait leering in the sunlight.",1083
4776,On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying.,1083
4777,"He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he drew back with a shudder.",1083
4778,"What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?",1084
4779,"How horrible it was!—more horrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he had left it.",1084
4780,"He heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man.",1085
4781,"Then, stooping down and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the picture.",1085
4782,"There he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him.",1086
4783,"He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.",1086
4784,"He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had thought of each other.",1086
4785,"“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.",1087
4786,"He turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.",1088
4787,"As he was going downstairs, he heard the key being turned in the lock.",1088
4788,It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library.,1089
4789,"He was pale, but absolutely calm.",1089
4790,"“I have done what you asked me to do,” he muttered.",1089
4791,"“And now, good-bye.",1089
4792,Let us never see each other again.”,1089
4793,"“You have saved me from ruin, Alan.",1090
4794,"I cannot forget that,” said Dorian simply.",1090
4795,"As soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs.",1091
4796,There was a horrible smell of nitric acid in the room.,1091
4797,But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.,1091
4798, CHAPTER XV.,1093
4799," That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady Narborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants.",1094
4800,"His forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his manner as he bent over his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as ever.",1094
4801,Perhaps one never seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to play a part.,1094
4802,Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age.,1094
4803,"Those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God and goodness.",1094
4804,"He himself could not help wondering at the calm of his demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life.",1094
4805,"It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness.",1095
4806,"She had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and French _esprit_ when she could get it.",1095
4807,"Dorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life.",1096
4808,"“I know, my dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say, “and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.",1096
4809,It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.,1096
4810,"As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.",1096
4811,"However, that was all Narborough’s fault.",1096
4812,"He was dreadfully short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything.”",1096
4813,Her guests this evening were rather tedious.,1097
4814,"The fact was, as she explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make matters worse, had actually brought her husband with her.",1097
4815,"“I think it is most unkind of her, my dear,” she whispered.",1097
4816,"“Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up.",1097
4817,You don’t know what an existence they lead down there.,1097
4818,It is pure unadulterated country life.,1097
4819,"They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to think about.",1097
4820,"There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner.",1097
4821,You shan’t sit next either of them.,1097
4822,You shall sit by me and amuse me.”,1097
4823,Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room.,1098
4824,Yes: it was certainly a tedious party.,1098
4825,"Two of the people he had never seen before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.",1098
4826,"He was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late!",1099
4827,I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me.”,1099
4828,"It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door opened and he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he ceased to feel bored.",1100
4829,But at dinner he could not eat anything.,1101
4830,Plate after plate went away untasted.,1101
4831,"Lady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the _menu_ specially for you,” and now and then Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence and abstracted manner.",1101
4832,From time to time the butler filled his glass with champagne.,1101
4833,"He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.",1101
4834,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the _chaud-froid_ was being handed round, “what is the matter with you to-night?",1102
4835,You are quite out of sorts.”,1102
4836,"“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous.",1103
4837,He is quite right.,1103
4838,I certainly should.”,1103
4839,"“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not been in love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.”",1104
4840,“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old lady.,1105
4841,“I really cannot understand it.”,1105
4842,"“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry.",1106
4843,“She is the one link between us and your short frocks.”,1106
4844,"“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry.",1107
4845,"But I remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how _décolletée_ she was then.”",1107
4846,"“She is still _décolletée_,” he answered, taking an olive in his long fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an _édition de luxe_ of a bad French novel.",1108
4847,"She is really wonderful, and full of surprises.",1108
4848,Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.,1108
4849,"When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”",1108
4850,"“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.",1109
4851,"“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess.",1110
4852,"“But her third husband, Lord Henry!",1110
4853,You don’t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?”,1110
4854,"“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”",1111
4855,“I don’t believe a word of it.”,1112
4856,"“Well, ask Mr. Gray.",1113
4857,He is one of her most intimate friends.”,1113
4858,"“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”",1114
4859,"“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian.",1115
4860,"“I asked her whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle.",1115
4861,"She told me she didn’t, because none of them had had any hearts at all.”",1115
4862,“Four husbands!,1116
4863,Upon my word that is _trop de zêle_.”,1116
4864,"“_Trop d’audace_, I tell her,” said Dorian.",1117
4865,“Oh!,1118
4866,"she is audacious enough for anything, my dear.",1118
4867,And what is Ferrol like?,1118
4868,I don’t know him.”,1118
4869,"“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,” said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.",1119
4870,Lady Narborough hit him with her fan.,1120
4871,"“Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”",1120
4872,"“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows.",1121
4873,“It can only be the next world.,1121
4874,This world and I are on excellent terms.”,1121
4875,"“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady, shaking her head.",1122
4876,Lord Henry looked serious for some moments.,1123
4877,"“It is perfectly monstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true.”",1123
4878,"“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his chair.",1124
4879,"“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing.",1125
4880,"“But really, if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion.”",1125
4881,"“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.",1126
4882,“You were far too happy.,1126
4883,"When a woman marries again, it is because she detested her first husband.",1126
4884,"When a man marries again, it is because he adored his first wife.",1126
4885,Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”,1126
4886,"“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady.",1127
4887,"“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was the rejoinder.",1128
4888,“Women love us for our defects.,1128
4889,"If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.",1128
4890,"You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite true.”",1128
4891,"“Of course it is true, Lord Henry.",1129
4892,"If we women did not love you for your defects, where would you all be?",1129
4893,Not one of you would ever be married.,1129
4894,You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors.,1129
4895,"Not, however, that that would alter you much.",1129
4896,"Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men.”",1129
4897,"“_Fin de siêcle_,” murmured Lord Henry.",1130
4898,"“_Fin du globe_,” answered his hostess.",1131
4899,"“I wish it were _fin du globe_,” said Dorian with a sigh.",1132
4900,“Life is a great disappointment.”,1132
4901,"“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves, “don’t tell me that you have exhausted life.",1133
4902,When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him.,1133
4903,"Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good—you look so good.",1133
4904,I must find you a nice wife.,1133
4905,"Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr. Gray should get married?”",1133
4906,"“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with a bow.",1134
4907,"“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him.",1135
4908,I shall go through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies.”,1135
4909,"“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian.",1136
4910,"“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited.",1137
4911,But nothing must be done in a hurry.,1137
4912,"I want it to be what _The Morning Post_ calls a suitable alliance, and I want you both to be happy.”",1137
4913,“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord Henry.,1138
4914,"“A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.”",1138
4915,“Ah!,1139
4916,"what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her chair and nodding to Lady Ruxton.",1139
4917,“You must come and dine with me soon again.,1139
4918,"You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me.",1139
4919,"You must tell me what people you would like to meet, though.",1139
4920,I want it to be a delightful gathering.”,1139
4921,"“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he answered.",1140
4922,“Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”,1140
4923,"“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up.",1141
4924,"“A thousand pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you hadn’t finished your cigarette.”",1141
4925,"“Never mind, Lady Narborough.",1142
4926,I smoke a great deal too much.,1142
4927,"I am going to limit myself, for the future.”",1142
4928,"“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry.",1143
4929,“Moderation is a fatal thing.,1143
4930,Enough is as bad as a meal.,1143
4931,More than enough is as good as a feast.”,1143
4932,Lady Ruxton glanced at him curiously.,1144
4933,"“You must come and explain that to me some afternoon, Lord Henry.",1144
4934,"It sounds a fascinating theory,” she murmured, as she swept out of the room.",1144
4935,"“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and scandal,” cried Lady Narborough from the door.",1145
4936,"“If you do, we are sure to squabble upstairs.”",1145
4937,"The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and came up to the top.",1146
4938,Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and sat by Lord Henry.,1146
4939,Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the House of Commons.,1146
4940,He guffawed at his adversaries.,1146
4941,The word _doctrinaire_—word full of terror to the British mind—reappeared from time to time between his explosions.,1146
4942,An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory.,1146
4943,He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought.,1146
4944,The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English common sense he jovially termed it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for society.,1146
4945,"A smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at Dorian.",1147
4946,"“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked.",1148
4947,“You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner.”,1148
4948,"“I am quite well, Harry.",1149
4949,I am tired.,1149
4950,That is all.”,1149
4951,“You were charming last night.,1150
4952,The little duchess is quite devoted to you.,1150
4953,She tells me she is going down to Selby.”,1150
4954,“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”,1151
4955,"“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”",1152
4956,"“Oh, yes, Harry.”",1153
4957,"“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her.",1154
4958,"She is very clever, too clever for a woman.",1154
4959,She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.,1154
4960,It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious.,1154
4961,"Her feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay.",1154
4962,"White porcelain feet, if you like.",1154
4963,"They have been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens.",1154
4964,She has had experiences.”,1154
4965,“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.,1155
4966,"“An eternity, she tells me.",1156
4967,"I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in.",1156
4968,Who else is coming?”,1156
4969,"“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set.",1157
4970,I have asked Lord Grotrian.”,1157
4971,"“I like him,” said Lord Henry.",1158
4972,"“A great many people don’t, but I find him charming.",1158
4973,He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over-educated.,1158
4974,He is a very modern type.”,1158
4975,"“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry.",1159
4976,He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.”,1159
4977,“Ah!,1160
4978,what a nuisance people’s people are!,1160
4979,Try and make him come.,1160
4980,"By the way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night.",1160
4981,You left before eleven.,1160
4982,What did you do afterwards?,1160
4983,Did you go straight home?”,1160
4984,Dorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.,1161
4985,"“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly three.”",1162
4986,“Did you go to the club?”,1163
4987,"“Yes,” he answered.",1164
4988,Then he bit his lip.,1164
4989,"“No, I don’t mean that.",1164
4990,I didn’t go to the club.,1164
4991,I walked about.,1164
4992,"I forget what I did.... How inquisitive you are, Harry!",1164
4993,You always want to know what one has been doing.,1164
4994,I always want to forget what I have been doing.,1164
4995,"I came in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time.",1164
4996,"I had left my latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in.",1164
4997,"If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him.”",1164
4998,Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.,1165
4999,"“My dear fellow, as if I cared!",1165
5000,Let us go up to the drawing-room.,1165
5001,"No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.",1165
5002,"Something has happened to you, Dorian.",1165
5003,Tell me what it is.,1165
5004,You are not yourself to-night.”,1165
5005,"“Don’t mind me, Harry.",1166
5006,"I am irritable, and out of temper.",1166
5007,"I shall come round and see you to-morrow, or next day.",1166
5008,Make my excuses to Lady Narborough.,1166
5009,I shan’t go upstairs.,1166
5010,I shall go home.,1166
5011,I must go home.”,1166
5012,"“All right, Dorian.",1167
5013,I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.,1167
5014,The duchess is coming.”,1167
5015,"“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room.",1168
5016,"As he drove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him.",1168
5017,"Lord Henry’s casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted his nerve still.",1168
5018,Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed.,1168
5019,He winced.,1168
5020,He hated the idea of even touching them.,1168
5021,Yet it had to be done.,1169
5022,"He realized that, and when he had locked the door of his library, he opened the secret press into which he had thrust Basil Hallward’s coat and bag.",1169
5023,A huge fire was blazing.,1169
5024,He piled another log on it.,1169
5025,The smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible.,1169
5026,It took him three-quarters of an hour to consume everything.,1169
5027,"At the end he felt faint and sick, and having lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he bathed his hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.",1169
5028,Suddenly he started.,1170
5029,"His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed nervously at his underlip.",1170
5030,"Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis.",1170
5031,"He watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed.",1170
5032,His breath quickened.,1170
5033,A mad craving came over him.,1170
5034,He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.,1170
5035,His eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek.,1170
5036,But he still watched the cabinet.,1170
5037,"At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring.",1170
5038,A triangular drawer passed slowly out.,1170
5039,"His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.",1170
5040,"It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.",1170
5041,He opened it.,1170
5042,"Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent.",1170
5043,"He hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his face.",1171
5044,"Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot, he drew himself up and glanced at the clock.",1171
5045,It was twenty minutes to twelve.,1171
5046,"He put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did so, and went into his bedroom.",1171
5047,"As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept quietly out of his house.",1172
5048,In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good horse.,1172
5049,He hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address.,1172
5050,The man shook his head.,1173
5051,"“It is too far for me,” he muttered.",1173
5052,"“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian.",1174
5053,“You shall have another if you drive fast.”,1174
5054,"“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an hour,” and after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove rapidly towards the river.",1175
5055, CHAPTER XVI.,1177
5056," A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist.",1178
5057,"The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.",1178
5058,From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter.,1178
5059,"In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.",1178
5060,"Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret.",1179
5061,"He had often tried it, and would try it again now.",1179
5062,"There were opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.",1179
5063,The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.,1180
5064,From time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it.,1180
5065,"The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.",1180
5066,Once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile.,1180
5067,A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles.,1180
5068,The sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.,1180
5069,"“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!” How the words rang in his ears!",1181
5070,"His soul, certainly, was sick to death.",1181
5071,Was it true that the senses could cure it?,1181
5072,Innocent blood had been spilled.,1181
5073,What could atone for that?,1181
5074,Ah!,1181
5075,"for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.",1181
5076,"Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him as he had done?",1181
5077,Who had made him a judge over others?,1181
5078,"He had said things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.",1181
5079,"On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step.",1182
5080,He thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster.,1182
5081,The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him.,1182
5082,His throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together.,1182
5083,He struck at the horse madly with his stick.,1182
5084,The driver laughed and whipped up.,1182
5085,"He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.",1182
5086,"The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider.",1183
5087,"The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.",1183
5088,Then they passed by lonely brickfields.,1184
5089,"The fog was lighter here, and he could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire.",1184
5090,"A dog barked as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed.",1184
5091,"The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.",1184
5092,After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven streets.,1185
5093,"Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.",1185
5094,He watched them curiously.,1185
5095,They moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things.,1185
5096,He hated them.,1185
5097,A dull rage was in his heart.,1185
5098,"As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards.",1185
5099,The driver beat at them with his whip.,1185
5100,It is said that passion makes one think in a circle.,1186
5101,"Certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still have dominated his temper.",1186
5102,"From cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.",1186
5103,"Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that very reason.",1186
5104,Ugliness was the one reality.,1186
5105,"The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.",1186
5106,They were what he needed for forgetfulness.,1186
5107,In three days he would be free.,1186
5108,Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.,1187
5109,Over the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships.,1187
5110,Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.,1187
5111,"“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily through the trap.",1188
5112,Dorian started and peered round.,1189
5113,"“This will do,” he answered, and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him, he walked quickly in the direction of the quay.",1189
5114,Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.,1189
5115,The light shook and splintered in the puddles.,1189
5116,A red glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was coaling.,1189
5117,The slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.,1189
5118,"He hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed.",1190
5119,In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.,1190
5120,In one of the top-windows stood a lamp.,1190
5121,He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.,1190
5122,After a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked.,1191
5123,"The door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed.",1191
5124,At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street.,1191
5125,He dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon.,1191
5126,"Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls.",1191
5127,"Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.",1191
5128,"The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.",1191
5129,"Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered.",1191
5130,"In one corner, with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust.",1191
5131,"“He thinks he’s got red ants on him,” laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by.",1191
5132,The man looked at her in terror and began to whimper.,1191
5133,"At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber.",1192
5134,"As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him.",1192
5135,"He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure.",1192
5136,"When he entered, a young man with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.",1192
5137,"“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.",1193
5138,"“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly.",1194
5139,“None of the chaps will speak to me now.”,1194
5140,“I thought you had left England.”,1195
5141,“Darlington is not going to do anything.,1196
5142,My brother paid the bill at last.,1196
5143,George doesn’t speak to me either....,1196
5144,"I don’t care,” he added with a sigh.",1196
5145,"“As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want friends.",1196
5146,I think I have had too many friends.”,1196
5147,Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses.,1197
5148,"The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him.",1197
5149,"He knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy.",1197
5150,They were better off than he was.,1197
5151,He was prisoned in thought.,1197
5152,"Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away.",1197
5153,From time to time he seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him.,1197
5154,Yet he felt he could not stay.,1197
5155,The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him.,1197
5156,He wanted to be where no one would know who he was.,1197
5157,He wanted to escape from himself.,1197
5158,"“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.",1198
5159,“On the wharf?”,1199
5160,“Yes.”,1200
5161,“That mad-cat is sure to be there.,1201
5162,They won’t have her in this place now.”,1201
5163,Dorian shrugged his shoulders.,1202
5164,“I am sick of women who love one.,1202
5165,Women who hate one are much more interesting.,1202
5166,"Besides, the stuff is better.”",1202
5167,“Much the same.”,1203
5168,“I like it better.,1204
5169,Come and have something to drink.,1204
5170,I must have something.”,1204
5171,"“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man.",1205
5172,“Never mind.”,1206
5173,Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar.,1207
5174,"A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them.",1207
5175,The women sidled up and began to chatter.,1207
5176,Dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.,1207
5177,"A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the women.",1208
5178,"“We are very proud to-night,” she sneered.",1208
5179,"“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian, stamping his foot on the ground.",1209
5180,“What do you want?,1209
5181,Money?,1209
5182,Here it is.,1209
5183,Don’t ever talk to me again.”,1209
5184,"Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then flickered out and left them dull and glazed.",1210
5185,She tossed her head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers.,1210
5186,Her companion watched her enviously.,1210
5187,"“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton.",1211
5188,“I don’t care to go back.,1211
5189,What does it matter?,1211
5190,I am quite happy here.”,1211
5191,"“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said Dorian, after a pause.",1212
5192,“Perhaps.”,1213
5193,"“Good night, then.”",1214
5194,"“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.",1215
5195,Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face.,1216
5196,"As he drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had taken his money.",1216
5197,"“There goes the devil’s bargain!” she hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.",1216
5198,"“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”",1217
5199,She snapped her fingers.,1218
5200,"“Prince Charming is what you like to be called, ain’t it?” she yelled after him.",1218
5201,"The drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly round.",1219
5202,The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear.,1219
5203,He rushed out as if in pursuit.,1219
5204,Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain.,1220
5205,"His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult.",1220
5206,"He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad.",1220
5207,"Yet, after all, what did it matter to him?",1220
5208,One’s days were too brief to take the burden of another’s errors on one’s shoulders.,1220
5209,Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.,1220
5210,The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault.,1220
5211,"One had to pay over and over again, indeed.",1220
5212,"In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.",1220
5213,"There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses.",1221
5214,Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.,1221
5215,They move to their terrible end as automatons move.,1221
5216,"Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.",1221
5217,"For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.",1221
5218,"When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.",1221
5219,"Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but as he darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his throat.",1222
5220,"He struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away.",1223
5221,"In a second he heard the click of a revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him.",1223
5222,“What do you want?” he gasped.,1224
5223,"“Keep quiet,” said the man.",1225
5224,"“If you stir, I shoot you.”",1225
5225,“You are mad.,1226
5226,What have I done to you?”,1226
5227,"“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and Sibyl Vane was my sister.",1227
5228,She killed herself.,1227
5229,I know it.,1227
5230,Her death is at your door.,1227
5231,I swore I would kill you in return.,1227
5232,For years I have sought you.,1227
5233,"I had no clue, no trace.",1227
5234,The two people who could have described you were dead.,1227
5235,I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you.,1227
5236,I heard it to-night by chance.,1227
5237,"Make your peace with God, for to-night you are going to die.”",1227
5238,Dorian Gray grew sick with fear.,1228
5239,"“I never knew her,” he stammered.",1228
5240,“I never heard of her.,1228
5241,You are mad.”,1228
5242,"“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are going to die.” There was a horrible moment.",1229
5243,Dorian did not know what to say or do.,1229
5244,“Down on your knees!” growled the man.,1229
5245,“I give you one minute to make your peace—no more.,1229
5246,"I go on board to-night for India, and I must do my job first.",1229
5247,One minute.,1229
5248,That’s all.”,1229
5249,Dorian’s arms fell to his side.,1230
5250,"Paralysed with terror, he did not know what to do.",1230
5251,Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain.,1230
5252,"“Stop,” he cried.",1230
5253,“How long ago is it since your sister died?,1230
5254,"Quick, tell me!”",1230
5255,"“Eighteen years,” said the man.",1231
5256,“Why do you ask me?,1231
5257,What do years matter?”,1231
5258,"“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his voice.",1232
5259,“Eighteen years!,1232
5260,Set me under the lamp and look at my face!”,1232
5261,"James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.",1233
5262,Then he seized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.,1233
5263,"Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth.",1234
5264,"He seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago.",1234
5265,It was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life.,1234
5266,He loosened his hold and reeled back.,1235
5267,“My God!,1235
5268,"my God!” he cried, “and I would have murdered you!”",1235
5269,Dorian Gray drew a long breath.,1236
5270,"“You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly.",1236
5271,“Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands.”,1236
5272,"“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane.",1237
5273,“I was deceived.,1237
5274,A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”,1237
5275,"“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the street.",1238
5276,James Vane stood on the pavement in horror.,1239
5277,He was trembling from head to foot.,1239
5278,"After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps.",1239
5279,He felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start.,1239
5280,It was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar.,1239
5281,"“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his.",1240
5282,“I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly’s.,1240
5283,You fool!,1240
5284,You should have killed him.,1240
5285,"He has lots of money, and he’s as bad as bad.”",1240
5286,"“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I want no man’s money.",1241
5287,I want a man’s life.,1241
5288,The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now.,1241
5289,This one is little more than a boy.,1241
5290,"Thank God, I have not got his blood upon my hands.”",1241
5291,The woman gave a bitter laugh.,1242
5292,“Little more than a boy!” she sneered.,1242
5293,"“Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.”",1242
5294,“You lie!” cried James Vane.,1243
5295,She raised her hand up to heaven.,1244
5296,"“Before God I am telling the truth,” she cried.",1244
5297,“Before God?”,1245
5298,“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so.,1246
5299,He is the worst one that comes here.,1246
5300,They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.,1246
5301,It’s nigh on eighteen years since I met him.,1246
5302,He hasn’t changed much since then.,1246
5303,"I have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.",1246
5304,“You swear this?”,1247
5305,"“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth.",1248
5306,"“But don’t give me away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him.",1248
5307,Let me have some money for my night’s lodging.”,1248
5308,"He broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.",1249
5309,"When he looked back, the woman had vanished also.",1249
5310, CHAPTER XVII.,1251
5311," A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband, a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests.",1252
5312,"It was tea-time, and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding.",1252
5313,"Her white hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her full red lips were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her.",1252
5314,"Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them.",1252
5315,"On a peach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke’s description of the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection.",1252
5316,Three young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women.,1252
5317,"The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more expected to arrive on the next day.",1252
5318,"“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over to the table and putting his cup down.",1253
5319,"“I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys.",1253
5320,It is a delightful idea.”,1253
5321,"“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the duchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes.",1254
5322,"“I am quite satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”",1254
5323,"“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world.",1255
5324,They are both perfect.,1255
5325,I was thinking chiefly of flowers.,1255
5326,"Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my button-hole.",1255
5327,"It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins.",1255
5328,In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called.,1255
5329,"He told me it was a fine specimen of _Robinsoniana_, or something dreadful of that kind.",1255
5330,"It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things.",1255
5331,Names are everything.,1255
5332,I never quarrel with actions.,1255
5333,My one quarrel is with words.,1255
5334,That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature.,1255
5335,The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.,1255
5336,It is the only thing he is fit for.”,1255
5337,"“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked.",1256
5338,"“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian.",1257
5339,"“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.",1258
5340,"“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair.",1259
5341,“From a label there is no escape!,1259
5342,I refuse the title.”,1259
5343,"“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.",1260
5344,"“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”",1261
5345,“Yes.”,1262
5346,“I give the truths of to-morrow.”,1263
5347,"“I prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.",1264
5348,"“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her mood.",1265
5349,"“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”",1266
5350,"“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.",1267
5351,"“That is your error, Harry, believe me.",1268
5352,You value beauty far too much.”,1268
5353,“How can you say that?,1269
5354,I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.,1269
5355,"But on the other hand, no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”",1269
5356,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the duchess.",1270
5357,“What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”,1270
5358,"“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys.",1271
5359,"You, as a good Tory, must not underrate them.",1271
5360,"Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she is.”",1271
5361,"“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked.",1272
5362,“I live in it.”,1273
5363,“That you may censure it the better.”,1274
5364,“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.,1275
5365,“What do they say of us?”,1276
5366,“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”,1277
5367,"“Is that yours, Harry?”",1278
5368,“I give it to you.”,1279
5369,“I could not use it.,1280
5370,It is too true.”,1280
5371,“You need not be afraid.,1281
5372,Our countrymen never recognize a description.”,1281
5373,“They are practical.”,1282
5374,“They are more cunning than practical.,1283
5375,"When they make up their ledger, they balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”",1283
5376,"“Still, we have done great things.”",1284
5377,"“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”",1285
5378,“We have carried their burden.”,1286
5379,“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”,1287
5380,She shook her head.,1288
5381,"“I believe in the race,” she cried.",1288
5382,“It represents the survival of the pushing.”,1289
5383,“It has development.”,1290
5384,“Decay fascinates me more.”,1291
5385,“What of art?” she asked.,1292
5386,“It is a malady.”,1293
5387,“Love?”,1294
5388,“An illusion.”,1295
5389,“Religion?”,1296
5390,“The fashionable substitute for belief.”,1297
5391,“You are a sceptic.”,1298
5392,“Never!,1299
5393,Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”,1299
5394,“What are you?”,1300
5395,“To define is to limit.”,1301
5396,“Give me a clue.”,1302
5397,“Threads snap.,1303
5398,You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”,1303
5399,“You bewilder me.,1304
5400,Let us talk of some one else.”,1304
5401,“Our host is a delightful topic.,1305
5402,Years ago he was christened Prince Charming.”,1305
5403,“Ah!,1306
5404,"don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray.",1306
5405,"“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess, colouring.",1307
5406,“I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly.”,1307
5407,"“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed Dorian.",1308
5408,“Oh!,1309
5409,"my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with me.”",1309
5410,"“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”",1310
5411,"“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you.",1311
5412,Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half-past eight.”,1311
5413,“How unreasonable of her!,1312
5414,You should give her warning.”,1312
5415,"“I daren’t, Mr. Gray.",1313
5416,"Why, she invents hats for me.",1313
5417,You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden-party?,1313
5418,"You don’t, but it is nice of you to pretend that you do.",1313
5419,"Well, she made it out of nothing.",1313
5420,All good hats are made out of nothing.”,1313
5421,"“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry.",1314
5422,“Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy.,1314
5423,To be popular one must be a mediocrity.”,1314
5424,"“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and women rule the world.",1315
5425,I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities.,1315
5426,"We women, as some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.”",1315
5427,"“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian.",1316
5428,“Ah!,1317
5429,"then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess with mock sadness.",1317
5430,“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry.,1318
5431,“How can you say that?,1318
5432,"Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.",1318
5433,"Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.",1318
5434,Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion.,1318
5435,It merely intensifies it.,1318
5436,"We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.”",1318
5437,"“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess after a pause.",1319
5438,"“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry.",1320
5439,The duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression in her eyes.,1321
5440,"“What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired.",1321
5441,Dorian hesitated for a moment.,1322
5442,Then he threw his head back and laughed.,1322
5443,"“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”",1322
5444,“Even when he is wrong?”,1323
5445,"“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”",1324
5446,“And does his philosophy make you happy?”,1325
5447,“I have never searched for happiness.,1326
5448,Who wants happiness?,1326
5449,I have searched for pleasure.”,1326
5450,"“And found it, Mr. Gray?”",1327
5451,“Often.,1328
5452,Too often.”,1328
5453,The duchess sighed.,1329
5454,"“I am searching for peace,” she said, “and if I don’t go and dress, I shall have none this evening.”",1329
5455,"“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to his feet and walking down the conservatory.",1330
5456,"“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his cousin.",1331
5457,“You had better take care.,1331
5458,He is very fascinating.”,1331
5459,"“If he were not, there would be no battle.”",1332
5460,"“Greek meets Greek, then?”",1333
5461,“I am on the side of the Trojans.,1334
5462,They fought for a woman.”,1334
5463,“They were defeated.”,1335
5464,"“There are worse things than capture,” she answered.",1336
5465,“You gallop with a loose rein.”,1337
5466,"“Pace gives life,” was the _riposte_.",1338
5467,“I shall write it in my diary to-night.”,1339
5468,“What?”,1340
5469,“That a burnt child loves the fire.”,1341
5470,“I am not even singed.,1342
5471,My wings are untouched.”,1342
5472,"“You use them for everything, except flight.”",1343
5473,“Courage has passed from men to women.,1344
5474,It is a new experience for us.”,1344
5475,“You have a rival.”,1345
5476,“Who?”,1346
5477,He laughed.,1347
5478,"“Lady Narborough,” he whispered.",1347
5479,“She perfectly adores him.”,1347
5480,“You fill me with apprehension.,1348
5481,The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists.”,1348
5482,“Romanticists!,1349
5483,You have all the methods of science.”,1349
5484,“Men have educated us.”,1350
5485,“But not explained you.”,1351
5486,"“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge.",1352
5487,“Sphinxes without secrets.”,1353
5488,"She looked at him, smiling.",1354
5489,“How long Mr. Gray is!” she said.,1354
5490,“Let us go and help him.,1354
5491,I have not yet told him the colour of my frock.”,1354
5492,“Ah!,1355
5493,"you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”",1355
5494,“That would be a premature surrender.”,1356
5495,“Romantic art begins with its climax.”,1357
5496,“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”,1358
5497,“In the Parthian manner?”,1359
5498,“They found safety in the desert.,1360
5499,I could not do that.”,1360
5500,"“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.",1361
5501,Everybody started up.,1361
5502,The duchess stood motionless in horror.,1361
5503,"And with fear in his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.",1361
5504,He was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of the sofas.,1362
5505,"After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression.",1362
5506,“What has happened?” he asked.,1363
5507,“Oh!,1363
5508,I remember.,1363
5509,"Am I safe here, Harry?” He began to tremble.",1363
5510,"“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted.",1364
5511,That was all.,1364
5512,You must have overtired yourself.,1364
5513,You had better not come down to dinner.,1364
5514,I will take your place.”,1364
5515,"“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet.",1365
5516,“I would rather come down.,1365
5517,I must not be alone.”,1365
5518,He went to his room and dressed.,1366
5519,"There was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that, pressed against the window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.",1366
5520, CHAPTER XVIII.,1368
5521," The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet indifferent to life itself.",1369
5522,"The consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down, had begun to dominate him.",1369
5523,"If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind, he shook.",1369
5524,The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets.,1369
5525,"When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart.",1369
5526,But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him.,1370
5527,"Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination.",1370
5528,It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin.,1370
5529,It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood.,1370
5530,"In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded.",1370
5531,"Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak.",1370
5532,That was all.,1370
5533,"Besides, had any stranger been prowling round the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers.",1370
5534,"Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have reported it.",1370
5535,"Yes, it had been merely fancy.",1370
5536,Sibyl Vane’s brother had not come back to kill him.,1370
5537,He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea.,1370
5538,"From him, at any rate, he was safe.",1370
5539,"Why, the man did not know who he was, could not know who he was.",1370
5540,The mask of youth had saved him.,1370
5541,"And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them visible form, and make them move before one!",1371
5542,"What sort of life would his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners, to mock him from secret places, to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast, to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep!",1371
5543,"As the thought crept through his brain, he grew pale with terror, and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder.",1371
5544,Oh!,1371
5545,in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend!,1371
5546,How ghastly the mere memory of the scene!,1371
5547,He saw it all again.,1371
5548,Each hideous detail came back to him with added horror.,1371
5549,"Out of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his sin.",1371
5550,"When Lord Henry came in at six o’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.",1371
5551,It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out.,1372
5552,"There was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life.",1372
5553,But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change.,1372
5554,His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm.,1372
5555,With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so.,1372
5556,Their strong passions must either bruise or bend.,1372
5557,"They either slay the man, or themselves die.",1372
5558,Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.,1372
5559,The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude.,1372
5560,"Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt.",1372
5561,"After breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party.",1373
5562,The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass.,1373
5563,The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal.,1373
5564,"A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake.",1373
5565,"At the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston, the duchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun.",1374
5566,"He jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the mare home, made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth.",1374
5567,"“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.",1375
5568,"“Not very good, Dorian.",1376
5569,I think most of the birds have gone to the open.,1376
5570,"I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new ground.”",1376
5571,Dorian strolled along by his side.,1377
5572,"The keen aromatic air, the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom.",1377
5573,"He was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.",1377
5574,"Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward, started a hare.",1378
5575,It bolted for a thicket of alders.,1378
5576,"Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder, but there was something in the animal’s grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey.",1378
5577,Let it live.”,1378
5578,"“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare bounded into the thicket, he fired.",1379
5579,"There were two cries heard, the cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.",1379
5580,“Good heavens!,1380
5581,I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.,1380
5582,“What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns!,1380
5583,Stop shooting there!” he called out at the top of his voice.,1380
5584,“A man is hurt.”,1380
5585,The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.,1381
5586,"“Where, sir?",1382
5587,Where is he?” he shouted.,1382
5588,"At the same time, the firing ceased along the line.",1382
5589,"“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.",1383
5590,“Why on earth don’t you keep your men back?,1383
5591,Spoiled my shooting for the day.”,1383
5592,"Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe swinging branches aside.",1384
5593,"In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight.",1384
5594,He turned away in horror.,1384
5595,It seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went.,1384
5596,"He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper.",1384
5597,The wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces.,1384
5598,There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices.,1384
5599,A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.,1384
5600,"After a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like endless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder.",1385
5601,He started and looked round.,1385
5602,"“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to-day.",1386
5603,It would not look well to go on.”,1386
5604,"“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly.",1387
5605,“The whole thing is hideous and cruel.,1387
5606,Is the man ...?”,1387
5607,He could not finish the sentence.,1388
5608,"“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry.",1389
5609,“He got the whole charge of shot in his chest.,1389
5610,He must have died almost instantaneously.,1389
5611,Come; let us go home.”,1389
5612,They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking.,1390
5613,"Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, “It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”",1390
5614,“What is?” asked Lord Henry.,1391
5615,“Oh!,1391
5616,"this accident, I suppose.",1391
5617,"My dear fellow, it can’t be helped.",1391
5618,It was the man’s own fault.,1391
5619,Why did he get in front of the guns?,1391
5620,"Besides, it is nothing to us.",1391
5621,"It is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course.",1391
5622,It does not do to pepper beaters.,1391
5623,It makes people think that one is a wild shot.,1391
5624,And Geoffrey is not; he shoots very straight.,1391
5625,But there is no use talking about the matter.”,1391
5626,Dorian shook his head.,1392
5627,"“It is a bad omen, Harry.",1392
5628,I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us.,1392
5629,"To myself, perhaps,” he added, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.",1392
5630,The elder man laughed.,1393
5631,"“The only horrible thing in the world is _ennui_, Dorian.",1393
5632,That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.,1393
5633,But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner.,1393
5634,I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed.,1393
5635,"As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen.",1393
5636,Destiny does not send us heralds.,1393
5637,She is too wise or too cruel for that.,1393
5638,"Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian?",1393
5639,You have everything in the world that a man can want.,1393
5640,There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you.”,1393
5641,"“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry.",1394
5642,Don’t laugh like that.,1394
5643,I am telling you the truth.,1394
5644,The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am.,1394
5645,I have no terror of death.,1394
5646,It is the coming of death that terrifies me.,1394
5647,Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me.,1394
5648,Good heavens!,1394
5649,"don’t you see a man moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?”",1394
5650,Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing.,1395
5651,"“Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener waiting for you.",1395
5652,I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night.,1395
5653,"How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow!",1395
5654,"You must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town.”",1395
5655,Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching.,1396
5656,"The man touched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he handed to his master.",1396
5657,"“Her Grace told me to wait for an answer,” he murmured.",1396
5658,Dorian put the letter into his pocket.,1397
5659,"“Tell her Grace that I am coming in,” he said, coldly.",1397
5660,The man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house.,1397
5661,“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry.,1398
5662,“It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most.,1398
5663,A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”,1398
5664,"“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry!",1399
5665,"In the present instance, you are quite astray.",1399
5666,"I like the duchess very much, but I don’t love her.”",1399
5667,"“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you are excellently matched.”",1400
5668,"“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for scandal.”",1401
5669,"“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord Henry, lighting a cigarette.",1402
5670,"“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”",1403
5671,"“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.",1404
5672,"“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice.",1405
5673,“But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire.,1405
5674,I am too much concentrated on myself.,1405
5675,My own personality has become a burden to me.,1405
5676,"I want to escape, to go away, to forget.",1405
5677,It was silly of me to come down here at all.,1405
5678,I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready.,1405
5679,On a yacht one is safe.”,1405
5680,"“Safe from what, Dorian?",1406
5681,You are in some trouble.,1406
5682,Why not tell me what it is?,1406
5683,You know I would help you.”,1406
5684,"“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly.",1407
5685,“And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine.,1407
5686,This unfortunate accident has upset me.,1407
5687,I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me.”,1407
5688,“What nonsense!”,1408
5689,"“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it.",1409
5690,Ah!,1409
5691,"here is the duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown.",1409
5692,"You see we have come back, Duchess.”",1409
5693,"“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered.",1410
5694,“Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset.,1410
5695,And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare.,1410
5696,How curious!”,1410
5697,"“Yes, it was very curious.",1411
5698,I don’t know what made me say it.,1411
5699,"Some whim, I suppose.",1411
5700,It looked the loveliest of little live things.,1411
5701,But I am sorry they told you about the man.,1411
5702,It is a hideous subject.”,1411
5703,"“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry.",1412
5704,“It has no psychological value at all.,1412
5705,"Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose, how interesting he would be!",1412
5706,I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder.”,1412
5707,"“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess.",1413
5708,"“Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?",1413
5709,"Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again.",1413
5710,He is going to faint.”,1413
5711,Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled.,1414
5712,"“It is nothing, Duchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order.",1414
5713,That is all.,1414
5714,I am afraid I walked too far this morning.,1414
5715,I didn’t hear what Harry said.,1414
5716,Was it very bad?,1414
5717,You must tell me some other time.,1414
5718,I think I must go and lie down.,1414
5719,"You will excuse me, won’t you?”",1414
5720,They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace.,1415
5721,"As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes.",1415
5722,“Are you very much in love with him?” he asked.,1415
5723,"She did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape.",1416
5724,"“I wish I knew,” she said at last.",1416
5725,He shook his head.,1417
5726,“Knowledge would be fatal.,1417
5727,It is the uncertainty that charms one.,1417
5728,A mist makes things wonderful.”,1417
5729,“One may lose one’s way.”,1418
5730,"“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”",1419
5731,“What is that?”,1420
5732,“Disillusion.”,1421
5733,"“It was my _début_ in life,” she sighed.",1422
5734,“It came to you crowned.”,1423
5735,“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”,1424
5736,“They become you.”,1425
5737,“Only in public.”,1426
5738,"“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry.",1427
5739,“I will not part with a petal.”,1428
5740,“Monmouth has ears.”,1429
5741,“Old age is dull of hearing.”,1430
5742,“Has he never been jealous?”,1431
5743,“I wish he had been.”,1432
5744,He glanced about as if in search of something.,1433
5745,“What are you looking for?” she inquired.,1433
5746,"“The button from your foil,” he answered.",1434
5747,“You have dropped it.”,1434
5748,She laughed.,1435
5749,“I have still the mask.”,1435
5750,"“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.",1436
5751,She laughed again.,1437
5752,Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit.,1437
5753,"Upstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror in every tingling fibre of his body.",1438
5754,Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear.,1438
5755,"The dreadful death of the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also.",1438
5756,He had nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.,1438
5757,"At five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty.",1439
5758,He was determined not to sleep another night at Selby Royal.,1439
5759,It was an ill-omened place.,1439
5760,Death walked there in the sunlight.,1439
5761,The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood.,1439
5762,"Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence.",1440
5763,"As he was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to the door, and his valet informed him that the head-keeper wished to see him.",1440
5764,He frowned and bit his lip.,1440
5765,"“Send him in,” he muttered, after some moments’ hesitation.",1440
5766,"As soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and spread it out before him.",1441
5767,"“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning, Thornton?” he said, taking up a pen.",1442
5768,"“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper.",1443
5769,“Was the poor fellow married?,1444
5770,"Had he any people dependent on him?” asked Dorian, looking bored.",1444
5771,"“If so, I should not like them to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”",1444
5772,"“We don’t know who he is, sir.",1445
5773,That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about.”,1445
5774,"“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly.",1446
5775,“What do you mean?,1446
5776,Wasn’t he one of your men?”,1446
5777,"“No, sir.",1447
5778,Never saw him before.,1447
5779,"Seems like a sailor, sir.”",1447
5780,"The pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating.",1448
5781,“A sailor?” he cried out.,1448
5782,“Did you say a sailor?”,1448
5783,"“Yes, sir.",1449
5784,"He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both arms, and that kind of thing.”",1449
5785,"“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes.",1450
5786,“Anything that would tell his name?”,1450
5787,"“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter.",1451
5788,There was no name of any kind.,1451
5789,"A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like.",1451
5790,A sort of sailor we think.”,1451
5791,Dorian started to his feet.,1452
5792,A terrible hope fluttered past him.,1452
5793,He clutched at it madly.,1452
5794,“Where is the body?” he exclaimed.,1452
5795,“Quick!,1452
5796,I must see it at once.”,1452
5797,"“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir.",1453
5798,The folk don’t like to have that sort of thing in their houses.,1453
5799,They say a corpse brings bad luck.”,1453
5800,“The Home Farm!,1454
5801,Go there at once and meet me.,1454
5802,Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round.,1454
5803,No.,1454
5804,Never mind.,1454
5805,I’ll go to the stables myself.,1454
5806,It will save time.”,1454
5807,"In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go.",1455
5808,"The trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path.",1455
5809,Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him.,1455
5810,He lashed her across the neck with his crop.,1455
5811,She cleft the dusky air like an arrow.,1455
5812,The stones flew from her hoofs.,1455
5813,At last he reached the Home Farm.,1456
5814,Two men were loitering in the yard.,1456
5815,He leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.,1456
5816,In the farthest stable a light was glimmering.,1456
5817,"Something seemed to tell him that the body was there, and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch.",1456
5818,"There he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his life.",1457
5819,Then he thrust the door open and entered.,1457
5820,On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers.,1458
5821,A spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face.,1458
5822,"A coarse candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.",1458
5823,Dorian Gray shuddered.,1459
5824,"He felt that his could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him.",1459
5825,“Take that thing off the face.,1460
5826,"I wish to see it,” he said, clutching at the door-post for support.",1460
5827,"When the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward.",1461
5828,A cry of joy broke from his lips.,1461
5829,The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane.,1461
5830,He stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body.,1462
5831,"As he rode home, his eyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.",1462
5832, CHAPTER XIX.,1464
5833," “There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,” cried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose-water.",1465
5834,“You are quite perfect.,1465
5835,"Pray, don’t change.”",1465
5836,Dorian Gray shook his head.,1466
5837,"“No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful things in my life.",1466
5838,I am not going to do any more.,1466
5839,I began my good actions yesterday.”,1466
5840,“Where were you yesterday?”,1467
5841,"“In the country, Harry.",1468
5842,I was staying at a little inn by myself.”,1468
5843,"“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good in the country.",1469
5844,There are no temptations there.,1469
5845,That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized.,1469
5846,Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to.,1469
5847,There are only two ways by which man can reach it.,1469
5848,"One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt.",1469
5849,"Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.”",1469
5850,"“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian.",1470
5851,“I have known something of both.,1470
5852,It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together.,1470
5853,"For I have a new ideal, Harry.",1470
5854,I am going to alter.,1470
5855,I think I have altered.”,1470
5856,“You have not yet told me what your good action was.,1471
5857,"Or did you say you had done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a perforated, shell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.",1471
5858,"“I can tell you, Harry.",1472
5859,It is not a story I could tell to any one else.,1472
5860,I spared somebody.,1472
5861,"It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean.",1472
5862,She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane.,1472
5863,I think it was that which first attracted me to her.,1472
5864,"You remember Sibyl, don’t you?",1472
5865,How long ago that seems!,1472
5866,"Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course.",1472
5867,She was simply a girl in a village.,1472
5868,But I really loved her.,1472
5869,I am quite sure that I loved her.,1472
5870,"All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her two or three times a week.",1472
5871,Yesterday she met me in a little orchard.,1472
5872,"The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing.",1472
5873,We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.,1472
5874,Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her.”,1472
5875,"“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry.",1473
5876,“But I can finish your idyll for you.,1473
5877,You gave her good advice and broke her heart.,1473
5878,That was the beginning of your reformation.”,1473
5879,"“Harry, you are horrible!",1474
5880,You mustn’t say these dreadful things.,1474
5881,Hetty’s heart is not broken.,1474
5882,"Of course, she cried and all that.",1474
5883,But there is no disgrace upon her.,1474
5884,"She can live, like Perdita, in her garden of mint and marigold.”",1474
5885,"“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as he leaned back in his chair.",1475
5886,"“My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously boyish moods.",1475
5887,Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank?,1475
5888,I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.,1475
5889,"Well, the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her to despise her husband, and she will be wretched.",1475
5890,"From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation.",1475
5891,"Even as a beginning, it is poor.",1475
5892,"Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her, like Ophelia?”",1475
5893,"“I can’t bear this, Harry!",1476
5894,"You mock at everything, and then suggest the most serious tragedies.",1476
5895,I am sorry I told you now.,1476
5896,I don’t care what you say to me.,1476
5897,I know I was right in acting as I did.,1476
5898,Poor Hetty!,1476
5899,"As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine.",1476
5900,"Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin.",1476
5901,I want to be better.,1476
5902,I am going to be better.,1476
5903,Tell me something about yourself.,1476
5904,What is going on in town?,1476
5905,I have not been to the club for days.”,1476
5906,“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”,1477
5907,"“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,” said Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.",1478
5908,"“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months.",1479
5909,"They have been very fortunate lately, however.",1479
5910,They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s suicide.,1479
5911,Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist.,1479
5912,"Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all.",1479
5913,I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco.,1479
5914,"It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco.",1479
5915,"It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”",1479
5916,"“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up his Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss the matter so calmly.",1480
5917,“I have not the slightest idea.,1481
5918,"If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine.",1481
5919,"If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.",1481
5920,Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me.,1481
5921,I hate it.”,1481
5922,“Why?” said the younger man wearily.,1482
5923,"“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything nowadays except that.",1483
5924,Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.,1483
5925,"Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian.",1483
5926,You must play Chopin to me.,1483
5927,The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.,1483
5928,Poor Victoria!,1483
5929,I was very fond of her.,1483
5930,The house is rather lonely without her.,1483
5931,"Of course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.",1483
5932,But then one regrets the loss even of one’s worst habits.,1483
5933,Perhaps one regrets them the most.,1483
5934,They are such an essential part of one’s personality.”,1483
5935,"Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys.",1484
5936,"After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?”",1484
5937,Lord Henry yawned.,1485
5938,"“Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury watch.",1485
5939,Why should he have been murdered?,1485
5940,He was not clever enough to have enemies.,1485
5941,"Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting.",1485
5942,But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible.,1485
5943,Basil was really rather dull.,1485
5944,"He only interested me once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.”",1485
5945,"“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in his voice.",1486
5946,“But don’t people say that he was murdered?”,1486
5947,"“Oh, some of the papers do.",1487
5948,It does not seem to me to be at all probable.,1487
5949,"I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them.",1487
5950,He had no curiosity.,1487
5951,It was his chief defect.”,1487
5952,"“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?” said the younger man.",1488
5953,He watched him intently after he had spoken.,1488
5954,"“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that doesn’t suit you.",1489
5955,"All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime.",1489
5956,"It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder.",1489
5957,"I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.",1489
5958,Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders.,1489
5959,I don’t blame them in the smallest degree.,1489
5960,"I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.”",1489
5961,“A method of procuring sensations?,1490
5962,"Do you think, then, that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?",1490
5963,Don’t tell me that.”,1490
5964,“Oh!,1491
5965,"anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.",1491
5966,“That is one of the most important secrets of life.,1491
5967,"I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake.",1491
5968,One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.,1491
5969,But let us pass from poor Basil.,1491
5970,"I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can’t.",1491
5971,I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal.,1491
5972,Yes: I should fancy that was his end.,1491
5973,"I see him lying now on his back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair.",1491
5974,"Do you know, I don’t think he would have done much more good work.",1491
5975,During the last ten years his painting had gone off very much.”,1491
5976,"Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch.",1492
5977,"As his pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards.",1492
5978,"“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off.",1493
5979,It seemed to me to have lost something.,1493
5980,It had lost an ideal.,1493
5981,"When you and he ceased to be great friends, he ceased to be a great artist.",1493
5982,What was it separated you?,1493
5983,I suppose he bored you.,1493
5984,"If so, he never forgave you.",1493
5985,It’s a habit bores have.,1493
5986,"By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you?",1493
5987,I don’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it.,1493
5988,Oh!,1493
5989,"I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way.",1493
5990,You never got it back?,1493
5991,What a pity!,1493
5992,it was really a masterpiece.,1493
5993,I remember I wanted to buy it.,1493
5994,I wish I had now.,1493
5995,It belonged to Basil’s best period.,1493
5996,"Since then, his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.",1493
5997,Did you advertise for it?,1493
5998,You should.”,1493
5999,"“I forget,” said Dorian.",1494
6000,“I suppose I did.,1494
6001,But I never really liked it.,1494
6002,I am sorry I sat for it.,1494
6003,The memory of the thing is hateful to me.,1494
6004,Why do you talk of it?,1494
6005,"It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—",1494
6006,"“Like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart.”",1495
6007, Yes: that is what it was like.”,1496
6008,Lord Henry laughed.,1497
6009,"“If a man treats life artistically, his brain is his heart,” he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.",1497
6010,Dorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.,1498
6011,"“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated, “‘a face without a heart.’”",1498
6012,The elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes.,1499
6013,"“By the way, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation run?—his own soul’?”",1499
6014,"The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend.",1500
6015,"“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”",1500
6016,"“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in surprise, “I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.",1501
6017,That is all.,1501
6018,"I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher.",1501
6019,"As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience.",1501
6020,It struck me as being rather dramatic.,1501
6021,London is very rich in curious effects of that kind.,1501
6022,"A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips—it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion.",1501
6023,"I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul, but that man had not.",1501
6024,"I am afraid, however, he would not have understood me.”",1501
6025,"“Don’t, Harry.",1502
6026,The soul is a terrible reality.,1502
6027,"It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away.",1502
6028,"It can be poisoned, or made perfect.",1502
6029,There is a soul in each one of us.,1502
6030,I know it.”,1502
6031,"“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”",1503
6032,“Quite sure.”,1504
6033,“Ah!,1505
6034,then it must be an illusion.,1505
6035,The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.,1505
6036,"That is the fatality of faith, and the lesson of romance.",1505
6037,How grave you are!,1505
6038,Don’t be so serious.,1505
6039,What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age?,1505
6040,No: we have given up our belief in the soul.,1505
6041,Play me something.,1505
6042,"Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth.",1505
6043,You must have some secret.,1505
6044,"I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.",1505
6045,"You are really wonderful, Dorian.",1505
6046,You have never looked more charming than you do to-night.,1505
6047,You remind me of the day I saw you first.,1505
6048,"You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.",1505
6049,"You have changed, of course, but not in appearance.",1505
6050,I wish you would tell me your secret.,1505
6051,"To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.",1505
6052,Youth!,1505
6053,There is nothing like it.,1505
6054,It’s absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth.,1505
6055,The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself.,1505
6056,They seem in front of me.,1505
6057,Life has revealed to them her latest wonder.,1505
6058,"As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.",1505
6059,I do it on principle.,1505
6060,"If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing.",1505
6061,How lovely that thing you are playing is!,1505
6062,"I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes?",1505
6063,It is marvellously romantic.,1505
6064,What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative!,1505
6065,Don’t stop.,1505
6066,I want music to-night.,1505
6067,It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.,1505
6068,"I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of.",1505
6069,"The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.",1505
6070,I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity.,1505
6071,"Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!",1505
6072,What an exquisite life you have had!,1505
6073,You have drunk deeply of everything.,1505
6074,You have crushed the grapes against your palate.,1505
6075,Nothing has been hidden from you.,1505
6076,And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music.,1505
6077,It has not marred you.,1505
6078,You are still the same.”,1505
6079,"“I am not the same, Harry.”",1506
6080,"“Yes, you are the same.",1507
6081,I wonder what the rest of your life will be.,1507
6082,Don’t spoil it by renunciations.,1507
6083,At present you are a perfect type.,1507
6084,Don’t make yourself incomplete.,1507
6085,You are quite flawless now.,1507
6086,You need not shake your head: you know you are.,1507
6087,"Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive yourself.",1507
6088,Life is not governed by will or intention.,1507
6089,"Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.",1507
6090,You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong.,1507
6091,"But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend.",1507
6092,Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.,1507
6093,"There are moments when the odour of _lilas blanc_ passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again.",1507
6094,"I wish I could change places with you, Dorian.",1507
6095,"The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you.",1507
6096,It always will worship you.,1507
6097,"You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found.",1507
6098,"I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself!",1507
6099,Life has been your art.,1507
6100,You have set yourself to music.,1507
6101,Your days are your sonnets.”,1507
6102,Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair.,1508
6103,"“Yes, life has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to have the same life, Harry.",1508
6104,And you must not say these extravagant things to me.,1508
6105,You don’t know everything about me.,1508
6106,"I think that if you did, even you would turn from me.",1508
6107,You laugh.,1508
6108,Don’t laugh.”,1508
6109,"“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian?",1509
6110,Go back and give me the nocturne over again.,1509
6111,"Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air.",1509
6112,"She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she will come closer to the earth.",1509
6113,You won’t?,1509
6114,"Let us go to the club, then.",1509
6115,"It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly.",1509
6116,"There is some one at White’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole, Bournemouth’s eldest son.",1509
6117,"He has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him to you.",1509
6118,He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you.”,1509
6119,"“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes.",1510
6120,"“But I am tired to-night, Harry.",1510
6121,I shan’t go to the club.,1510
6122,"It is nearly eleven, and I want to go to bed early.”",1510
6123,“Do stay.,1511
6124,You have never played so well as to-night.,1511
6125,There was something in your touch that was wonderful.,1511
6126,It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before.”,1511
6127,"“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling.",1512
6128,“I am a little changed already.”,1512
6129,"“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry.",1513
6130,“You and I will always be friends.”,1513
6131,“Yet you poisoned me with a book once.,1514
6132,I should not forgive that.,1514
6133,"Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one.",1514
6134,It does harm.”,1514
6135,"“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize.",1515
6136,"You will soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired.",1515
6137,You are much too delightful to do that.,1515
6138,"Besides, it is no use.",1515
6139,"You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be.",1515
6140,"As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing as that.",1515
6141,Art has no influence upon action.,1515
6142,It annihilates the desire to act.,1515
6143,It is superbly sterile.,1515
6144,The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.,1515
6145,That is all.,1515
6146,But we won’t discuss literature.,1515
6147,Come round to-morrow.,1515
6148,I am going to ride at eleven.,1515
6149,"We might go together, and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.",1515
6150,"She is a charming woman, and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.",1515
6151,Mind you come.,1515
6152,Or shall we lunch with our little duchess?,1515
6153,She says she never sees you now.,1515
6154,Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?,1515
6155,I thought you would be.,1515
6156,Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves.,1515
6157,"Well, in any case, be here at eleven.”",1515
6158,"“Must I really come, Harry?”",1516
6159,“Certainly.,1517
6160,The park is quite lovely now.,1517
6161,I don’t think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you.”,1517
6162,“Very well.,1518
6163,"I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian.",1518
6164,"“Good night, Harry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say.",1518
6165,Then he sighed and went out.,1518
6166, CHAPTER XX.,1520
6167," It was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat.",1521
6168,"As he strolled home, smoking his cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him.",1521
6169,"He heard one of them whisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about.",1521
6170,He was tired of hearing his own name now.,1521
6171,Half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was.,1521
6172,"He had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor, and she had believed him.",1521
6173,"He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at him and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.",1521
6174,What a laugh she had!—just like a thrush singing.,1521
6175,And how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats!,1521
6176,"She knew nothing, but she had everything that he had lost.",1521
6177,"When he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him.",1522
6178,"He sent him to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.",1522
6179,Was it really true that one could never change?,1523
6180,"He felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it.",1523
6181,"He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his own, it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame.",1523
6182,But was it all irretrievable?,1523
6183,Was there no hope for him?,1523
6184,Ah!,1524
6185,"in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth!",1524
6186,All his failure had been due to that.,1524
6187,Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it.,1524
6188,There was purification in punishment.,1524
6189,Not “Forgive us our sins” but “Smite us for our iniquities” should be the prayer of man to a most just God.,1524
6190,"The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as of old.",1525
6191,"He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield.",1525
6192,"Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: “The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.",1525
6193,"The curves of your lips rewrite history.” The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to himself.",1525
6194,"Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel.",1525
6195,"It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for.",1525
6196,"But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain.",1525
6197,"His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.",1525
6198,What was youth at best?,1525
6199,"A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.",1525
6200,Why had he worn its livery?,1525
6201,Youth had spoiled him.,1525
6202,It was better not to think of the past.,1526
6203,Nothing could alter that.,1526
6204,"It was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think.",1526
6205,James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.,1526
6206,"Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know.",1526
6207,"The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward’s disappearance would soon pass away.",1526
6208,It was already waning.,1526
6209,He was perfectly safe there.,1526
6210,"Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind.",1526
6211,It was the living death of his own soul that troubled him.,1526
6212,Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life.,1526
6213,He could not forgive him that.,1526
6214,It was the portrait that had done everything.,1526
6215,"Basil had said things to him that were unbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience.",1526
6216,The murder had been simply the madness of a moment.,1526
6217,"As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own act.",1526
6218,He had chosen to do it.,1526
6219,It was nothing to him.,1526
6220,A new life!,1527
6221,That was what he wanted.,1527
6222,That was what he was waiting for.,1527
6223,Surely he had begun it already.,1527
6224,"He had spared one innocent thing, at any rate.",1527
6225,He would never again tempt innocence.,1527
6226,He would be good.,1527
6227,"As he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed.",1528
6228,Surely it was not still so horrible as it had been?,1528
6229,"Perhaps if his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face.",1528
6230,Perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away.,1528
6231,He would go and look.,1528
6232,He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.,1529
6233,"As he unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his lips.",1529
6234,"Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him.",1529
6235,He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.,1529
6236,"He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.",1530
6237,A cry of pain and indignation broke from him.,1530
6238,"He could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.",1530
6239,"The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.",1530
6240,Then he trembled.,1530
6241,Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed?,1530
6242,"Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his mocking laugh?",1530
6243,Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves?,1530
6244,"Or, perhaps, all these?",1530
6245,And why was the red stain larger than it had been?,1530
6246,It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.,1530
6247,"There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped—blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.",1530
6248,Confess?,1530
6249,Did it mean that he was to confess?,1530
6250,To give himself up and be put to death?,1530
6251,He laughed.,1530
6252,He felt that the idea was monstrous.,1530
6253,"Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him?",1530
6254,There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.,1530
6255,Everything belonging to him had been destroyed.,1530
6256,He himself had burned what had been below-stairs.,1530
6257,The world would simply say that he was mad.,1530
6258,They would shut him up if he persisted in his story....,1530
6259,"Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement.",1530
6260,There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven.,1530
6261,Nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin.,1530
6262,His sin?,1530
6263,He shrugged his shoulders.,1530
6264,The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him.,1530
6265,He was thinking of Hetty Merton.,1530
6266,"For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at.",1530
6267,Vanity?,1530
6268,Curiosity?,1530
6269,Hypocrisy?,1530
6270,Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that?,1530
6271,There had been something more.,1530
6272,At least he thought so.,1530
6273,But who could tell?,1530
6274,... No.,1530
6275,There had been nothing more.,1530
6276,Through vanity he had spared her.,1530
6277,In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness.,1530
6278,For curiosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self.,1530
6279,He recognized that now.,1530
6280,But this murder—was it to dog him all his life?,1531
6281,Was he always to be burdened by his past?,1531
6282,Was he really to confess?,1531
6283,Never.,1531
6284,There was only one bit of evidence left against him.,1531
6285,The picture itself—that was evidence.,1531
6286,He would destroy it.,1531
6287,Why had he kept it so long?,1531
6288,Once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.,1531
6289,Of late he had felt no such pleasure.,1531
6290,It had kept him awake at night.,1531
6291,"When he had been away, he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it.",1531
6292,It had brought melancholy across his passions.,1531
6293,Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy.,1531
6294,It had been like conscience to him.,1531
6295,"Yes, it had been conscience.",1531
6296,He would destroy it.,1531
6297,He looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.,1532
6298,"He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it.",1532
6299,"It was bright, and glistened.",1532
6300,"As it had killed the painter, so it would kill the painter’s work, and all that that meant.",1532
6301,"It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he would be free.",1532
6302,"It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he would be at peace.",1532
6303,"He seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it.",1532
6304,"There was a cry heard, and a crash.",1533
6305,The cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.,1533
6306,"Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked up at the great house.",1533
6307,They walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back.,1533
6308,"The man rang the bell several times, but there was no answer.",1533
6309,"Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all dark.",1533
6310,"After a time, he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched.",1533
6311,"“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two gentlemen.",1534
6312,“Mr.,1535
6313,"Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.",1535
6314,"They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered.",1536
6315,One of them was Sir Henry Ashton’s uncle.,1536
6316,"Inside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other.",1537
6317,Old Mrs.,1537
6318,Leaf was crying and wringing her hands.,1537
6319,Francis was as pale as death.,1537
6320,"After about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept upstairs.",1538
6321,"They knocked, but there was no reply.",1538
6322,They called out.,1538
6323,Everything was still.,1538
6324,"Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony.",1538
6325,The windows yielded easily—their bolts were old.,1538
6326,"When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty.",1539
6327,"Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart.",1539
6328,"He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage.",1539
6329,It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.,1539
6330,THE END,1540
