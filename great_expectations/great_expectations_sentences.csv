90,"As I saw him go, picking his way among thenettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he lookedin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon hisankle and pull him in.",44

92,"WhenI saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use ofmy legs.",45
93,"But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going onagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, andpicking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped intothe marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains wereheavy or the tide was in.",45
94,"The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stoppedto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, notnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of longangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.",46
95,"On the edge of theriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all theprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was thebeacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon apole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, withsome chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.",46
96,"The man waslimping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,and come down, and going back to hook himself up again.",46

100,Chapter II.,48
101,"My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighboursbecause she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to findout for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have ahard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon herhusband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were bothbrought up by hand.",49
102,"She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a generalimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand.",50
103,"Joewas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smoothface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed tohave somehow got mixed with their own whites.",50
104,"He was a mild,good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sortof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.",50
105,"My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailingredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possibleshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.",51
106,"She was talland bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over herfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib infront, that was stuck full of pins and needles.",51
107,"She made it a powerfulmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore thisapron so much.",51
108,"Though I really see no reason why she should have wornit at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have takenit off, every day of her life.",51
109,"Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many ofthe dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time.",52
110,"When Iran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe wassitting alone in the kitchen.",52
111,"Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, andhaving confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the momentI raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,sitting in the chimney corner.",52
112,“Mrs.,53
113,"Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip.",53
114,"And she’sout now, making it a baker’s dozen.”",53
115,“Is she?”,54
116,"“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”",55
117,"At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoatround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.",56
118,"Ticklerwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickledframe.",56
119,"“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab atTickler, and she Ram-paged out.",57
120,"That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowlyclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking atit; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”",57
121,"“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger speciesof child, and as no more than my equal.",58
122,"“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on theRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.",59
123,She’s a-coming!,59
124,"Getbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”",59
125,I took the advice.,60
126,"My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,and applied Tickler to its further investigation.",60
127,"She concluded bythrowing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad toget hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietlyfenced me up there with his great leg.",60
128,"“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping herfoot.",61
129,"“Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away withfret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if youwas fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”",61
130,"“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying andrubbing myself.",62
131,“Churchyard!” repeated my sister.,63
132,"“If it warn’t for me you’d have beento the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.",63
133,Who brought you up byhand?”,63
134,"“You did,” said I.",64
135,"“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.",65
136,"I whimpered, “I don’t know.”",66
137,“_I_ don’t!” said my sister.,67
138,“I’d never do it again!,67
139,I know that.,67
140,I maytruly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.,67
141,It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) withoutbeing your mother.”,67
142,My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately atthe fire.,68
143,"For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, themysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I wasunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before mein the avenging coals.",68
144,"“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station.",69
145,"“Churchyard,indeed!",69
146,"You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,had not said it at all.",69
147,"“You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixtyou, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be withoutme!”",69
148,"As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at meover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, andcalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under thegrievous circumstances foreshadowed.",70
149,"After that, he sat feeling hisright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about withhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.",70
150,"My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,that never varied.",71
151,"First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hardand fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, andsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.",71
152,"Then shetook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—usingboth sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming andmoulding the butter off round the crust.",71
153,"Then, she gave the knife afinal smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a verythick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from theloaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.",71
154,"On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.",72
155,"I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadfulacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man.",72
156,"I knewMrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that mylarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.",72
157,Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg ofmy trousers.,72
158,The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose Ifound to be quite awful.,73
159,"It was as if I had to make up my mind to leapfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.",73
160,And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.,73
161,"In ouralready-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in hisgood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to comparethe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to eachother’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.",73
162,"To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fastdiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but hefound me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and myuntouched bread and butter on the other.",73
163,"At last, I desperatelyconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it hadbest be done in the least improbable manner consistent with thecircumstances.",73
164,"I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked atme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.",73
165,"Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my lossof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which hedidn’t seem to enjoy.",74
166,"He turned it about in his mouth much longer thanusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down likea pill.",74
167,"He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head onone side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he sawthat my bread and butter was gone.",74
168,"The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold ofhis bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’sobservation.",75
169,"“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.",76
170,"“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very seriousremonstrance.",77
171,"“Pip, old chap!",77
172,You’ll do yourself a mischief.,77
173,It’llstick somewhere.,77
174,"You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”",77
175,"“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.",78
176,"“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to doit,” said Joe, all aghast.",79
177,"“Manners is manners, but still your elth’syour elth.”",79
178,"By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a littlewhile against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, lookingguiltily on.",80
179,"“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out ofbreath, “you staring great stuck pig.”",81
180,"Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, andlooked at me again.",82
181,"“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,any time.",83
182,"But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floorbetween us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”",83
183,"“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.",84
184,"“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was yourage—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I neversee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolteddead.”",85
185,"My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, sayingnothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”",86
186,"Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a finemedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.",87
187,"At thebest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as achoice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling likea new fence.",87
188,"On this particular evening the urgency of my case demandeda pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greatercomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would beheld in a bootjack.",87
189,"Joe got off with half a pint; but was made toswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching andmeditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging frommyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had hadnone before.",87
190,"Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, inthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secretburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a greatpunishment.",88
191,"The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—Inever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of thehousekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keepingone hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered aboutthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.",88
192,"Then,as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard thevoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me tosecrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve untilto-morrow, but must be fed now.",88
193,"At other times, I thought, What if theyoung man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing hishands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or shouldmistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart andliver to-night, instead of to-morrow!",88
194,"If ever anybody’s hair stood onend with terror, mine must have done so then.",88
195,"But, perhaps, nobody’sever did?",88
196,"It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, witha copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.",89
197,"I tried it withthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with theload on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring thebread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.",89
198,"Happily I slippedaway, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.",89
199,"“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a finalwarm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that greatguns, Joe?”",90
200,“Ah!” said Joe.,91
201,“There’s another conwict off.”,91
202,"“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.",92
203,"Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,“Escaped.",93
204,Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.,93
205,"While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put mymouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?” Joe put_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”",94
206,"“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “aftersunset-gun.",95
207,And they fired warning of him.,95
208,And now it appears they’refiring warning of another.”,95
209,“_Who’s_ firing?” said I.,96
210,"“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,“what a questioner he is.",97
211,"Ask no questions, and you’ll be told nolies.”",97
212,"It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should betold lies by her even if I did ask questions.",98
213,But she never was politeunless there was company.,98
214,"At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmostpains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of aword that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed toMrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joewouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.",99
215,But I could makenothing of the word.,99
216,“Mrs.,100
217,"Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if youwouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”",100
218,"“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite meanthat but rather the contrary.",101
219,“From the Hulks!”,101
220,"“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe.",102
221,“Hulks!”,102
222,"Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”",103
223,"“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.",104
224,"“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me outwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me.",105
225,"“Answer him onequestion, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly.",105
226,"Hulks are prison-ships,right ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in ourcountry.",105
227,"“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there?” saidI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.",106
228,"It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose.",107
229,"“I tell you what,young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badgerpeople’s lives out.",107
230,"It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.",107
231,"People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by askingquestions.",107
232,"Now, you get along to bed!”",107
233,"I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I wentupstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe’s thimblehaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—Ifelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks werehandy for me.",108
234,I was clearly on my way there.,108
235,"I had begun by askingquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.",108
236,"Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thoughtthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.",109
237,"No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror.",109
238,"I was inmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was inmortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortalterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I hadno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed meat every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done onrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.",109
239,"If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself driftingdown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly piratecalling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed thegibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there atonce, and not put it off.",110
240,"I was afraid to sleep, even if I had beeninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must robthe pantry.",110
241,"There was no doing it in the night, for there was nogetting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must havestruck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the verypirate himself rattling his chains.",110
242,"As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window wasshot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Getup, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly suppliedthan usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a harehanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my backwas half turned, winking.",111
243,"I had no time for verification, no time forselection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.",111
244,"I stolesome bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which Itied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), somebrandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I hadsecretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle froma jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, anda beautiful round compact pork pie.",111
245,"I was nearly going away without thepie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was thatwas put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was notintended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.",111
246,"There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; Iunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.",112
247,"Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at whichI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for themisty marshes.",112
248,Chapter III.,114
249,"It was a rimy morning, and very damp.",115
250,"I had seen the damp lying on theoutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying thereall night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief.",115
251,"Now, I sawthe damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sortof spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.",115
252,"On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was sothick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to ourvillage—a direction which they never accepted, for they never camethere—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it.",115
253,"Then, as Ilooked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed consciencelike a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.",115
254,"The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so thatinstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.",116
255,This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind.,116
256,"The gates and dikes andbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainlyas could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie!",116
257,"Stop him!” Thecattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One blackox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened consciencesomething of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, andmoved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I movedround, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir!",116
258,"It wasn’tfor myself I took it!” Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud ofsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs anda flourish of his tail.",116
259,"All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast Iwent, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet.",117
260,"Iknew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down thereon a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me thatwhen I was ’prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larksthere!",117
261,"However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at lasttoo far to the right, and consequently had to try back along theriver-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakesthat staked the tide out.",117
262,"Making my way along here with all despatch, Ihad just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, andhad just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the mansitting before me.",117
263,"His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.",117
264,"I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him onthe shoulder.",118
265,"He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, butanother man!",118
266,"And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great ironon his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything thatthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flatbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on.",119
267,"All this I saw in a moment, forI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit atme,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himselfdown, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumblingtwice as he went, and I lost him.",119
268,"“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identifiedhim.",120
269,"I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I hadknown where it was.",120
270,"I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the rightman,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never allnight left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me.",121
271,"He was awfullycold, to be sure.",121
272,I half expected to see him drop down before my faceand die of deadly cold.,121
273,"His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, thatwhen I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, itoccurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen mybundle.",121
274,"He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied mypockets.",121
275,"“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he.",122
276,"“Brandy,” said I.",123
277,"He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curiousmanner,—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violenthurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some ofthe liquor.",124
278,"He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quiteas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between histeeth, without biting it off.",124
279,"“I think you have got the ague,” said I.",125
280,"“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he.",126
281,"“It’s bad about here,” I told him.",127
282,"“You’ve been lying out on themeshes, and they’re dreadful aguish.",127
283,Rheumatic too.”,127
284,"“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he.",128
285,"“I’d dothat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there isover there, directly afterwards.",128
286,"I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll betyou.”",128
287,"He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, allat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all roundus, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen.",129
288,"Some real orfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon themarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,—",129
289,“You’re not a deceiving imp?,130
290,You brought no one with you?”,130
291,"“No, sir!",131
292,No!”,131
293,“Nor giv’ no one the office to follow you?”,132
294,“No!”,133
295,"“Well,” said he, “I believe you.",134
296,"You’d be but a fierce young houndindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretchedwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmintis!”",134
297,"Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,and was going to strike.",135
298,And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve overhis eyes.,135
299,"Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled downupon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”",136
300,“Did you speak?”,137
301,“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”,138
302,"“Thankee, my boy.",139
303,I do.”,139
304,"I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I nownoticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and theman’s.",140
305,"The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog.",140
306,"Heswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thoughtthere was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take thepie away.",140
307,"He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, toappreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine withhim, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor.",140
308,In all ofwhich particulars he was very like the dog.,140
309,"“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly; aftera silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of makingthe remark.",141
310,“There’s no more to be got where that came from.” It wasthe certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.,141
311,“Leave any for him?,142
312,"Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in hiscrunching of pie-crust.",142
313,“The young man.,143
314,That you spoke of.,143
315,That was hid with you.”,143
316,"“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh.",144
317,“Him?,144
318,"Yes,yes!",144
319,_He_ don’t want no wittles.”,144
320,"“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I.",145
321,"The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny andthe greatest surprise.",146
322,“Looked?,147
323,When?”,147
324,“Just now.”,148
325,“Where?”,149
326,"“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him noddingasleep, and thought it was you.”",150
327,"He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think hisfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.",151
328,"“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling;“and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the samereason for wanting to borrow a file.",152
329,Didn’t you hear the cannon lastnight?”,152
330,“Then there _was_ firing!” he said to himself.,153
331,"“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for weheard it up at home, and that’s farther away, and we were shut inbesides.”",154
332,"“Why, see now!” said he.",155
333,"“When a man’s alone on these flats, with alight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hearsnothin’ all night, but guns firing, and voices calling.",155
334,Hears?,155
335,"He seesthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carriedafore, closing in round him.",155
336,"Hears his number called, hears himselfchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Makeready!",155
337,Present!,155
338,"Cover him steady, men!’ and is laid hands on—andthere’s nothin’!",155
339,"Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming upin order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred.",155
340,And as tofiring!,155
341,"Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broadday,—But this man”; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten mybeing there; “did you notice anything in him?”",155
342,"“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew Iknew.",156
343,"“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,with the flat of his hand.",157
344,"“Yes, there!”",158
345,"“Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast ofhis grey jacket.",159
346,“Show me the way he went.,159
347,"I’ll pull him down, like abloodhound.",159
348,Curse this iron on my sore leg!,159
349,"Give us hold of the file,boy.”",159
350,"I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, andhe looked up at it for an instant.",160
351,"But he was down on the rank wetgrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or mindinghis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but whichhe handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.",160
352,"I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himselfinto this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keepingaway from home any longer.",160
353,"I told him I must go, but he took no notice,so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off.",160
354,"The last I sawof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at hisfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg.",160
355,"The lastI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was stillgoing.",160
356,Chapter IV.,162
357,"I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take meup.",163
358,"But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yetbeen made of the robbery.",163
359,"Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting thehouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put uponthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article intowhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister wasvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.",163
360,"“And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmassalutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.",164
361,I said I had been down to hear the Carols.,165
362,“Ah!,165
363,well!” observed Mrs.Joe.,165
364,“You might ha’ done worse.” Not a doubt of that I thought.,165
365,"“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) aslave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear theCarols,” said Mrs. Joe.",166
366,"“I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, andthat’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”",166
367,"Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan hadretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with aconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when hereyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, andexhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.",167
368,"This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, forweeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as totheir legs.",167
369,"We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled porkand greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls.",168
370,"A handsome mince-pie hadbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat notbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil.",168
371,"These extensivearrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect ofbreakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have noformal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve gotbefore me, I promise you!”",168
372,"So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops ona forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps ofmilk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on thedresser.",169
373,"In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, andtacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace theold one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of theyear in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the fourlittle white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a blacknose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart ofthe other.",169
374,"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisiteart of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable thandirt itself.",169
375,"Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do thesame by their religion.",169
376,"My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, thatis to say, Joe and I were going.",170
377,"In his working-clothes, Joe was awell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, hewas more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.",170
378,Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; andeverything that he wore then grazed him.,170
379,"On the present festiveoccasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.",170
380,"As to me,I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a youngoffender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) anddelivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outragedmajesty of the law.",170
381,"I was always treated as if I had insisted on beingborn in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends.",170

383,"Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectaclefor compassionate minds.",171
384,"Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing towhat I underwent within.",171
385,"The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to beequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands haddone.",171
386,"Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether theChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of theterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment.",171
387,"I conceivedthe idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergymansaid, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise andpropose a private conference in the vestry.",171
388,"I am far from being surethat I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting tothis extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.",171
389,"Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubblethe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler inthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart.",172
390,The dinner hour washalf-past one.,172

392,"And still, not a word of the robbery.",172
393,"The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, andthe company came.",173
394,"Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a largeshining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proudof; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you couldonly give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; hehimself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning tocompetition, he would not despair of making his mark in it.",173
395,"The Churchnot being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk.",173
396,"But hepunished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—alwaysgiving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, asmuch as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with youropinion of this style!”",173
397,"I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit ofours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next toMr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.",174
398,N.B.,174
399,"_I_ wasnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.",174
400,“Mrs.,175
401,"Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-agedslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hairstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just beenall but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as thecompliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherrywine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”",175
402,"Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, withexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.",176
403,"Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—clePum-ble—chook!",176

405,"And now are you allbobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.",176
406,"We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nutsand oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very likeJoe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress.",177
407,"My sisterwas uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generallymore gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company.",177
408,"Iremember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had marriedMr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was muchyounger than he.",177
409,"I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legsextraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw somemiles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.",177
410,"Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’trobbed the pantry, in a false position.",178
411,"Not because I was squeezed inat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, andthe Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed tospeak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with thescaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscurecorners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reasonto be vain.",178
412,"No; I should not have minded that, if they would only haveleft me alone.",178
413,But they wouldn’t leave me alone.,178
414,"They seemed to thinkthe opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,every now and then, and stick the point into me.",178
415,"I might have been anunfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touchedup by these moral goads.",178
416,It began the moment we sat down to dinner.,179
417,"Mr. Wopsle said grace withtheatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like areligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—andended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.",179
418,"Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a lowreproachful voice, “Do you hear that?",179
419,Be grateful.”,179
420,"“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them whichbrought you up by hand.”",180
421,"Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournfulpresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that theyoung are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for thecompany until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterallywicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in aparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.",181
422,Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) whenthere was company than when there was none.,182
423,"But he always aided andcomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always didso at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any.",182
424,"There beingplenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, abouthalf a pint.",182
425,"A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon withsome severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of theChurch being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon _he_ would have giventhem.",183
426,"After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, heremarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, illchosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so manysubjects “going about.”",183
427,"“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook.",184
428,"“You’ve hit it, sir!",184
429,"Plenty ofsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon theirtails.",184
430,That’s what’s wanted.,184
431,"A man needn’t go far to find a subject, ifhe’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a shortinterval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone.",184
432,There’s a subject!,184
433,"If youwant a subject, look at Pork!”",184
434,"“True, sir.",185
435,"Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and Iknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deducedfrom that text.”",185
436,"(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)",186
437,Joe gave me some more gravy.,187
438,"“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing hisfork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swinewere the companions of the prodigal.",188
439,"The gluttony of Swine is putbefore us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well inhim who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)",188
440,“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”,188
441,"“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.",189
442,"“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, ratherirritably, “but there is no girl present.”",190

444,If you’d been born a Squeaker—”,191
445,"“He _was_, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.",192
446,Joe gave me some more gravy.,193
447,"“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook.",194
448,"“Ifyou had been born such, would you have been here now?",194
449,Not you—”,194
450,"“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.",195
451,"“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who hadan objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with hiselders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, androlling in the lap of luxury.",196
452,Would he have been doing that?,196
453,"No, hewouldn’t.",196
454,And what would have been your destination?” turning on meagain.,196
455,"“You would have been disposed of for so many shillings accordingto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher wouldhave come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whippedyou under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up hisfrock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he wouldhave shed your blood and had your life.",196
456,No bringing up by hand then.,196
457,Not a bit of it!”,196
458,"Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.",197
459,"“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,commiserating my sister.",198
460,"“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearfulcatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the actsof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbledfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries Ihad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and Ihad contumaciously refused to go there.",199
461,"I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, withtheir noses.",200
462,"Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, inconsequence.",200
463,"Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, duringthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull ituntil he howled.",200
464,"But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing incomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when thepause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in whichpause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) withindignation and abhorrence.",200
465,"“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to thetheme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,too; ain’t it?”",201
466,"“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.",202
467,"O Heavens, it had come at last!",203
468,"He would find it was weak, he would sayit was weak, and I was lost!",203
469,"I held tight to the leg of the table underthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.",203
470,"My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any.",204
471,"The wretched mantrifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, putit down,—prolonged my misery.",204
472,All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe werebriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.,204
473,I couldn’t keep my eyes off him.,205
474,"Always holding tight by the leg of thetable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger hisglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink thebrandy off.",205
475,"Instantly afterwards, the company were seized withunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turninground several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, andrushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,and apparently out of his mind.",205
476,"I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him.",206
477,"I didn’t know how Ihad done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow.",206
478,"In mydreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, andsurveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”",206
479,I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug.,207
480,I knew he would beworse by and by.,207
481,"I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.",207
482,"“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement.",208
483,"“Why, how ever could Tar comethere?”",208
484,"But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’thear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it allaway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water.",209
485,"My sister, who hadbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively ingetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, andmixing them.",209
486,"For the time being at least, I was saved.",209
487,"I still held onto the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor ofgratitude.",209
488,"By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake ofpudding.",210
489,Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding.,210
490,All partook of pudding.,210
491,"The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under thegenial influence of gin and water.",210
492,"I began to think I should get overthe day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”",210
493,"I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to mybosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of mysoul.",211
494,"I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really wasgone.",211
495,"“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her bestgrace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and deliciouspresent of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”",212
496,Must they!,213
497,Let them not hope to taste it!,213
498,"“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory porkpie.”",214
499,The company murmured their compliments.,215
500,"Uncle Pumblechook, sensible ofhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,all things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavours;let us have a cut at this same pie.”",215
501,My sister went out to get it.,216
502,I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.,216
503,I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife.,216
504,I saw reawakening appetite inthe Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle.,216
505,"I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bitof savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and dono harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have neverbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.",216
506,"I felt thatI could bear no more, and that I must run away.",216
507,"I released the leg ofthe table, and ran for my life.",216
508,"But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremostinto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out apair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”",217
509,Chapter V.,219
510,"The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of theirloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise fromtable in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchenempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of“Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”",220
511,The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; atwhich crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses.,221
512,"It was thesergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at thecompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in hisright hand, and his left on my shoulder.",221
513,"“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I havementioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which he hadn’t),“I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”",222
514,"“And pray what might you want with _him_?” retorted my sister, quick toresent his being wanted at all.",223
515,"“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I shouldreply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”",224
516,"This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”",225
517,"“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time pickedout Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I findthe lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.",226
518,"As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye overthem?”",226
519,"Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job wouldnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer twohours than one.",227
520,“Will it?,227
521,"Then will you set about it at once,blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’sservice.",227
522,"And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll makethemselves useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came troopinginto the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.",227
523,"And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their handsloosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly overtheir high stocks, out into the yard.",227
524,"All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I wasin an agony of apprehension.",228
525,"But beginning to perceive that thehandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got thebetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a littlemore of my scattered wits.",228
526,"“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself toMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified theinference that he was equal to the time.",229
527,“It’s just gone half past two.”,230
528,"“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I wasforced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do.",231
529,"How far might you callyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?",231
530,"Not above a mile, I reckon?”",231
531,"“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.",232
532,“That’ll do.,233
533,We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk.,233
534,"A little beforedusk, my orders are.",233
535,That’ll do.”,233
536,"“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.",234
537,"“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two.",235
538,"They’re pretty well known to be outon the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em beforedusk.",235
539,Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”,235
540,"Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence.",236
541,Nobody thought ofme.,236
542,"“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in acircle, I expect, sooner than they count on.",237
543,"Now, blacksmith!",237
544,"If you’reready, his Majesty the King is.”",237
545,"Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leatherapron on, and passed into the forge.",238
546,"One of the soldiers opened itswooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at thebellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring.",238
547,"ThenJoe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.",238
548,"The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the generalattention, but even made my sister liberal.",239
549,"She drew a pitcher of beerfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take aglass of brandy.",239
550,"But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine,Mum.",239
551,"I’ll engage there’s no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked himand said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would takewine, if it was equally convenient.",239
552,"When it was given him, he drank hisMajesty’s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at amouthful and smacked his lips.",239
553,"“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.",240
554,"“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect thatstuff’s of _your_ providing.”",241
555,"Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay?",242
556,Why?”,242
557,"“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’rea man that knows what’s what.”",243
558,"“D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh.",244
559,“Haveanother glass!”,244
560,“With you.,245
561,"Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant.",245
562,"“The top of mine to thefoot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ringtwice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses!",245
563,Your health.,245
564,"May you livea thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than youare at the present moment of your life!”",245
565,The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready foranother glass.,246
566,"I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitalityappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took thebottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in agush of joviality.",246
567,Even I got some.,246
568,"And he was so very free of the winethat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about withthe same liberality, when the first was gone.",246
569,"As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for adinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was.",247
570,"They had not enjoyedthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightenedwith the excitement he furnished.",247
571,"And now, when they were all in livelyanticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellowsseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoketo hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, andall the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as theblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the paleafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to haveturned pale on their account, poor wretches.",247
572,"At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped.",248
573,"AsJoe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of usshould go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.",248
574,"Mr.Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would.",248
575,"Joe said he wasagreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved.",248
576,"We never shouldhave got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to knowall about it and how it ended.",248
577,"As it was, she merely stipulated, “Ifyou bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’tlook to me to put it together again.”",248
578,"The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fullysensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as whensomething moist was going.",249
579,His men resumed their muskets and fell in.,249
580,"Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, andto speak no word after we reached the marshes.",249
581,"When we were all out inthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, Itreasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” andJoe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,Pip.”",249
582,"We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather wascold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness comingon, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.",250
583,"Afew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none cameout.",250
584,"We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.",250
585,"There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’shand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among thegraves, and also examined the porch.",250
586,"They came in again without findinganything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gateat the side of the churchyard.",250
587,"A bitter sleet came rattling against ushere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.",250
588,"Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they littlethought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both menhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we shouldcome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I whohad brought the soldiers there?",251
589,"He had asked me if I was a deceivingimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined thehunt against him.",251
590,"Would he believe that I was both imp and hound intreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?",251
591,It was of no use asking myself this question now.,252
592,"There I was, on Joe’sback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like ahunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, andto keep up with us.",252
593,"The soldiers were in front of us, extending into apretty wide line with an interval between man and man.",252
594,"We were takingthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.",252
595,"Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.",252
596,"Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and themound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,though all of a watery lead colour.",252
597,"With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, Ilooked all about for any sign of the convicts.",253
598,"I could see none, Icould hear none.",253
599,"Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, byhis blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, andcould dissociate them from the object of pursuit.",253
600,"I got a dreadfulstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only asheep-bell.",253
601,"The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, staredangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, exceptthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.",253
602,"The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and wewere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we allstopped.",254
603,"For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, along shout.",254
604,It was repeated.,254
605,"It was at a distance towards the east, butit was long and loud.",254
606,"Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raisedtogether,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.",254
607,"To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking undertheir breath, when Joe and I came up.",255
608,"After another moment’s listening,Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)agreed.",255
609,"The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should notbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his menshould make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I hadto hold on tight to keep my seat.",255
610,"It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words hespoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and overgates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: noman cared where he went.",256
611,"As we came nearer to the shouting, it becamemore and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.",256
612,"Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.",256
613,"When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater ratethan ever, and we after them.",256
614,"After a while, we had so run it down,that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,“Convicts!",256
615,Runaways!,256
616,Guard!,256
617,"This way for the runaway convicts!” Thenboth voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then wouldbreak out again.",256
618,"And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran likedeer, and Joe too.",256
619,"The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, andtwo of his men ran in close upon him.",257
620,Their pieces were cocked andlevelled when we all ran in.,257
621,"“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of aditch.",258
622,"“Surrender, you two!",258
623,and confound you for two wild beasts!,258
624,Comeasunder!”,258
625,"Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into theditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict andthe other one.",259
626,Both were bleeding and panting and execrating andstruggling; but of course I knew them both directly.,259
627,"“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his raggedsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “_I_ took him!",260
628,_I_give him up to you!,260
629,Mind that!”,260
630,"“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll doyou small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself.",261
631,Handcuffsthere!”,261
632,“I don’t expect it to do me any good.,262
633,"I don’t want it to do me moregood than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh.",262
634,“I tookhim.,262
635,He knows it.,262
636,That’s enough for me.”,262
637,"The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the oldbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.",263
638,"He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were bothseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself fromfalling.",263
639,"“Take notice, guard,—he tried to murder me,” were his first words.",264
640,"“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully.",265
641,"“Try, and not doit?",265
642,"I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done.",265
643,"I not onlyprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,—draggedhim this far on his way back.",265
644,"He’s a gentleman, if you please, thisvillain.",265
645,"Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me.",265
646,Murderhim?,265
647,"Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and draghim back!”",265
648,"The other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried-to—murder me.",266
649,Bear—bearwitness.”,266
650,“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant.,267
651,“Single-handed I gotclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it.,267
652,I could ha’ gotclear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t findmuch iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that _he_ was here.,267
653,Let_him_ go free?,267
654,Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out?,267
655,Let _him_make a tool of me afresh and again?,267
656,Once more?,267
657,"No, no, no.",267
658,"If I haddied at the bottom there,” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditchwith his manacled hands, “I’d have held to him with that grip, that youshould have been safe to find him in my hold.”",267
659,"The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of hiscompanion, repeated, “He tried to murder me.",268
660,I should have been a deadman if you had not come up.”,268
661,"“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy.",269
662,"“He’s a liar born, andhe’ll die a liar.",269
663,Look at his face; ain’t it written there?,269
664,Let himturn those eyes of his on me.,269
665,I defy him to do it.”,269
666,"The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any setexpression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes andat the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.",270
667,“Do you see him?” pursued my convict.,271
668,“Do you see what a villain he is?,271
669,Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes?,271
670,That’s how he lookedwhen we were tried together.,271
671,He never looked at me.”,271
672,"The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyesrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a momenton the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and witha half-taunting glance at the bound hands.",272
673,"At that point, my convictbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon himbut for the interposition of the soldiers.",272
674,"“Didn’t I tell you,” saidthe other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And anyone could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out uponhis lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.",272
675,"“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant.",273
676,“Light those torches.”,273
677,"As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, wentdown on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the firsttime, and saw me.",274
678,"I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of theditch when we came up, and had not moved since.",274
679,"I looked at him eagerlywhen he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head.",274
680,Ihad been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of myinnocence.,274
681,"It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehendedmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and itall passed in a moment.",274
682,"But if he had looked at me for an hour or for aday, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as havingbeen more attentive.",274
683,"The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or fourtorches, and took one himself and distributed the others.",275
684,"It had beenalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwardsvery dark.",275
685,"Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing ina ring, fired twice into the air.",275
686,"Presently we saw other torcheskindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on theopposite bank of the river.",275
687,"“All right,” said the sergeant.",275
688,“March.”,275
689,We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with asound that seemed to burst something inside my ear.,276
690,"“You are expectedon board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.",276
691,"Don’t straggle, my man.",276
692,Close up here.”,276
693,"The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separateguard.",277
694,"I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of thetorches.",277
695,"Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved tosee it out, so we went on with the party.",277
696,"There was a reasonably goodpath now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here andthere where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddysluice-gate.",277
697,"When I looked round, I could see the other lights comingin after us.",277
698,"The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire uponthe track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring.",277
699,Icould see nothing else but black darkness.,277
700,"Our lights warmed the airabout us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed ratherto like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.",277
701,"Wecould not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.",277
702,"After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hutand a landing-place.",278
703,"There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,and the sergeant answered.",278
704,"Then, we went into the hut, where there wasa smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and astand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like anovergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about adozen soldiers all at once.",278
705,"Three or four soldiers who lay upon it intheir great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted theirheads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again.",278
706,"The sergeantmade some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then theconvict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,to go on board first.",278
707,"My convict never looked at me, except that once.",279
708,"While we stood in thehut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting uphis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as ifhe pitied them for their recent adventures.",279
709,"Suddenly, he turned to thesergeant, and remarked,—",279
710,“I wish to say something respecting this escape.,280
711,It may prevent somepersons laying under suspicion alonger me.”,280
712,"“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coollylooking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say ithere.",281
713,"You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear aboutit, before it’s done with, you know.”",281
714,"“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter.",282
715,A man can’tstarve; at least _I_ can’t.,282
716,"I took some wittles, up at the willage overyonder,—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”",282
717,"“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.",283
718,“And I’ll tell you where from.,284
719,From the blacksmith’s.”,284
720,"“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.",285
721,"“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.",286
722,"“It was some broken wittles—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor,and a pie.”",287
723,"“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” askedthe sergeant, confidentially.",288
724,"“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.",289
725,"Don’t you know,Pip?”",289
726,"“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, andwithout the least glance at me,—“so you’re the blacksmith, are you?",290
727,"Than I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”",290
728,"“God knows you’re welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returnedJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe.",291
729,"“We don’t know what youhave done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death for it, poormiserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”",291
730,"The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throatagain, and he turned his back.",292
731,"The boat had returned, and his guardwere ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of roughstakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by acrew of convicts like himself.",292
732,"No one seemed surprised to see him, orinterested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, orspoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars.",292
733,"By thelight of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way fromthe mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark.",292
734,"Cribbed and barred andmoored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyesto be ironed like the prisoners.",292
735,"We saw the boat go alongside, and wesaw him taken up the side and disappear.",292
736,"Then, the ends of the torcheswere flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all overwith him.",292
737,Chapter VI.,294
738,My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been sounexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but Ihope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.,295
739,"I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in referenceto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me.",296
740,"But Iloved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days thanbecause the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner selfwas not so easily composed.",296
741,It was much upon my mind (particularly whenI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joethe whole truth.,296
742,"Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrustedthat if I did, he would think me worse than I was.",296
743,"The fear of losingJoe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner atnight staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied upmy tongue.",296
744,"I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, Inever afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fairwhisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it.",296
745,"That, if Joeknew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, atyesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, withoutthinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry.",296
746,"That,if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic liferemarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that hesuspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face.",296
747,"In a word,I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been toocowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.",296
748,"I had had nointercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of itsmany inhabitants who act in this manner.",296
749,"Quite an untaught genius, Imade the discovery of the line of action for myself.",296
750,"As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe tookme on his back again and carried me home.",297
751,"He must have had a tiresomejourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very badtemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably haveexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself.",297
752,"Inhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such aninsane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at thekitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would havehanged him, if it had been a capital offence.",297
753,"By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a littledrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and throughhaving been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights andnoise of tongues.",298
754,"As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thumpbetween the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah!",298
755,"Was thereever such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling themabout the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggestingdifferent ways by which he had got into the pantry.",298
756,"Mr. Pumblechookmade out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first gotupon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of thehouse, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope madeof his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was verypositive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreedthat it must be so.",298
757,"Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” withthe feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coaton, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hardbehind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the dampout: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.",298
758,"This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as aslumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to bedwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to bedangling them all against the edges of the stairs.",299
759,"My state of mind, asI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lastedlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentionedsaving on exceptional occasions.",299
760,Chapter VII.,301
761,"At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the familytombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out.",302
762,"Myconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for Iread “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’sexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relationshad been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formedthe worst opinions of that member of the family.",302
763,"Neither were mynotions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, atall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed mydeclaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,”laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from ourhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning downby the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.",302
764,"When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until Icould assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called“Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered.",303
765,"Therefore, I was not onlyodd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extraboy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I wasfavoured with the employment.",303
766,"In order, however, that our superiorposition might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on thekitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all myearnings were dropped.",303
767,"I have an impression that they were to becontributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.",303
768,"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that isto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimitedinfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, inthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for theimproving opportunity of seeing her do it.",304
769,"She rented a small cottage,and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used tooverhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, andoccasionally bumping on the ceiling.",304
770,There was a fiction that Mr.Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter.,304
771,"What he did on thoseoccasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us MarkAntony’s oration over the body of Caesar.",304
772,"This was always followed byCollins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, andtaking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look.",304
773,"It was notwith me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society ofthe Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to thedisadvantage of both gentlemen.",304
774,"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,kept in the same room—a little general shop.",305
775,"She had no idea what stockshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was alittle greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as aCatalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shoptransactions.",305
776,"Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; Iconfess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, whatrelation she was to Mr. Wopsle.",305
777,"She was an orphan like myself; like me,too, had been brought up by hand.",305
778,"She was most noticeable, I thought,in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mendingand pulling up at heel.",305
779,This description must be received with aweek-day limitation.,305
780,"On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.",305
781,"Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had beena bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by everyletter.",306
782,"After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, whoseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves andbaffle recognition.",306
783,"But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, toread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.",306
784,"One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expendinggreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe.",307
785,"I think it musthave been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was along time after, and it was winter and a hard frost.",307
786,"With an alphabeton the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or twoto print and smear this epistle:—",307
787,“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGEU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX ANBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.”,308
788,"There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe byletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone.",309
789,"But I deliveredthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joereceived it as a miracle of erudition.",309
790,"“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what ascholar you are!",310
791,An’t you?”,310
792,"“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.",311
793,"“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink!",312
794,"Here’s a J anda O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”",312
796,"I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than thismonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when Iaccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suithis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right.",314
797,"Wishing toembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, Ishould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah!",314
798,"But read therest, Jo.”",314
799,"“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searchingeye, “One, two, three.",315
800,"Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and threeJ-O, Joes in it, Pip!”",315
801,"I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him thewhole letter.",316
802,"“Astonishing!” said Joe, when I had finished.",317
803,“You ARE a scholar.”,317
804,"“How do you spell Gargery, Joe?” I asked him, with a modest patronage.",318
805,"“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe.",319
806,“But supposing you did?”,320
807,"“It _can’t_ be supposed,” said Joe.",321
808,"“Tho’ I’m uncommon fond of reading,too.”",321
809,"“Are you, Joe?”",322
810,“On-common.,323
811,"Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, andsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.",323
812,"Lord!” hecontinued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you _do_ come to a Jand a O, and says you, ‘Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,’ how interestingreading is!”",323
813,"I derived from this, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in itsinfancy.",324
814,"Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—",324
815,"“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”",325
816,"“No, Pip.”",326
817,"“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”",327
818,"“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to hisusual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the firebetween the lower bars; “I’ll tell you.",328
819,"My father, Pip, he were givento drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at mymother, most onmerciful.",328
820,"It were a’most the only hammering he did,indeed, ’xcepting at myself.",328
821,"And he hammered at me with a wigor only tobe equalled by the wigor with which he didn’t hammer at hisanwil.—You’re a listening and understanding, Pip?”",328
822,"“Yes, Joe.”",329
823,"“Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father severaltimes; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d say, “Joe,”she’d say, “now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,” andshe’d put me to school.",330
824,But my father were that good in his hart thathe couldn’t abear to be without us.,330
825,"So, he’d come with a mosttremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses wherewe was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with usand to give us up to him.",330
826,And then he took us home and hammered us.,330
827,"Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of thefire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”",330
828,"“Certainly, poor Joe!”",331
829,"“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of thepoker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintainingequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in hishart, don’t you see?”",332
830,I didn’t see; but I didn’t say so.,333
831,"“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or thepot won’t bile, don’t you know?”",334
832,"I saw that, and said so.",335
833,"“Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to work; soI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he wouldhave followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip.",336
834,"Intime I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in apurple leptic fit.",336
835,"And it were my intentions to have had put upon histombstone that, Whatsume’er the failings on his part, Remember readerhe were that good in his heart.”",336
836,"Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and carefulperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.",337
837,"“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self.",338
838,I made it in a moment.,338
839,"It was likestriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow.",338
840,"I never was somuch surprised in all my life,—couldn’t credit my own ed,—to tell youthe truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed.",338
841,"As I was saying, Pip,it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costsmoney, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done.",338
842,"Notto mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted formy mother.",338
843,"She were in poor elth, and quite broke.",338
844,"She weren’t long offollowing, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.”",338
845,"Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,with the round knob on the top of the poker.",339
846,"“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I gotacquainted with your sister.",340
847,"Now, Pip,”—Joe looked firmly at me as ifhe knew I was not going to agree with him;—“your sister is a finefigure of a woman.”",340
848,"I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.",341
849,"“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on thatsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with thepoker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!”",342
850,"I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so,Joe.”",343
851,"“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up.",344
852,"“_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.",344
853,"A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what doesit signify to Me?”",344
854,"I sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did itsignify?",345
855,“Certainly!” assented Joe.,346
856,“That’s it.,346
857,"You’re right, old chap!",346
858,"When Igot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringingyou up by hand.",346
859,"Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,along with all the folks.",346
860,"As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenanceexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could havebeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d haveformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”",346
861,"Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”",347
862,"“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity.",348
863,"“When Ioffered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church atsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said toher, ‘And bring the poor little child.",348
864,"God bless the poor littlechild,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for _him_ at the forge!’”",348
865,"I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends;an’t us, Pip?",349
866,"Don’t cry, old chap!”",349
867,"When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—",350
868,"“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are!",351
869,That’s about where it lights;here we are!,351
870,"Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and Itell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’tsee too much of what we’re up to.",351
871,"It must be done, as I may say, on thesly.",351
872,And why on the sly?,351
873,"I’ll tell you why, Pip.”",351
874,"He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he couldhave proceeded in his demonstration.",352
875,“Your sister is given to government.”,353
876,"“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in afavour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.",354
877,"“Given to government,” said Joe.",355
878,“Which I meantersay the government ofyou and myself.”,355
879,“Oh!”,356
880,"“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joecontinued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being ascholar, for fear as I might rise.",357
881,"Like a sort of rebel, don’t yousee?”",357
882,"I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—”when Joe stopped me.",358
883,“Stay a bit.,359
884,"I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit!",359
885,"Idon’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again.",359
886,"Idon’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop downupon us heavy.",359
887,"At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candourcompels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”",359
888,"Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capitalBs.",360
889,“Why don’t I rise?,361
890,"That were your observation when I broke it off,Pip?”",361
891,"“Yes, Joe.”",362
892,"“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he mightfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to thatplacid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind.",363
893,A master-mind.”,363
894,"“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand.",364
895,"ButJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completelystopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,“Her.”",364
896,"“And I ain’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,and got back to his whisker.",365
897,"“And last of all, Pip,—and this I want tosay very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, ofa woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and nevergetting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead afeerd of goingwrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d furrather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and be a littleill-conwenienced myself.",365
898,"I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; Iwish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take itall on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, andI hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”",365
899,"Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe fromthat night.",366
900,"We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking abouthim, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking upto Joe in my heart.",366
901,"“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s theDutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em,and she’s not come home yet!",367
902,"I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s mare mayn’thave set a forefoot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”",367
903,"Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required awoman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing noconfidences in his domestic servant.",368
904,"This was market-day, and Mrs. Joewas out on one of these expeditions.",368
905,"Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door tolisten for the chaise-cart.",369
906,"It was a dry cold night, and the wind blewkeenly, and the frost was white and hard.",369
907,"A man would die to-night oflying out on the marshes, I thought.",369
908,"And then I looked at the stars,and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up tothem as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all theglittering multitude.",369
909,"“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”",370
910,"The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, asshe came along at a much brisker trot than usual.",371
911,"We got a chair out,ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they mightsee a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen thatnothing might be out of its place.",371
912,"When we had completed thesepreparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes.",371
913,"Mrs. Joe was soonlanded, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare witha cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold airin with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.",371
914,"“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, andthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,“if this boy ain’t grateful this night, he never will be!”",372
915,"I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was whollyuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.",373
916,"“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.",374
917,But I have my fears.”,374
918,"“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook.",375
919,“She knowsbetter.”,375
920,She?,376
921,"I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips andeyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back ofhis hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on suchoccasions, and looked at her.",376
922,"“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way.",377
923,“What are you staring at?,377
924,Is the house afire?”,377
925,"“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”",378
926,"“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister.",379
927,“Unless you call MissHavisham a he.,379
928,And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”,379
929,"“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.",380
930,“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.,381
931,“She wants this boy to go and play there.,382
932,And of course he’s going.,382
933,"Andhe had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as anencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”",382
934,"I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round hadheard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady wholived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and wholed a life of seclusion.",383
935,"“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded.",384
936,“I wonder how she come to knowPip!”,384
937,“Noodle!” cried my sister.,385
938,“Who said she knew him?”,385
939,"“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned thatshe wanted him to go and play there.”",386
940,“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go andplay there?,387
941,"Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may bea tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won’t say quarterly orhalf-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—butsometimes—go there to pay his rent?",387
942,And couldn’t she then ask UnclePumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there?,387
943,"And couldn’tUncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful forus—though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepestreproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention thisboy, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was notdoing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”",387
944,“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook.,388
945,“Well put!,388
946,Prettily pointed!,388
947,Good indeed!,388
948,"Now Joseph, you know the case.”",388
949,"“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joeapologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,“you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case.",389
950,"You mayconsider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph.",389
951,"For you do not knowthat Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,this boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham’s, hasoffered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and tokeep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to MissHavisham’s to-morrow morning.",389
952,"And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my sister,casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking tomere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catchingcold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hairof his head to the sole of his foot!”",389
953,"With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my facewas squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under tapsof water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, andthumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite besidemyself.",390
954,"(I may here remark that I suppose myself to be betteracquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of awedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)",390
955,"When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of thestiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and wastrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit.",391
956,"I was then deliveredover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were theSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had beendying to make all along: “Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, butespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!”",391
957,"“Good-bye, Joe!”",392
958,"“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”",393
959,"I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and whatwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.",394
960,"Butthey twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on thequestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham’s, and whaton earth I was expected to play at.",394
961,Chapter VIII.,396
962,"Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High Street of the market town, wereof a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of acornchandler and seedsman should be.",397
963,"It appeared to me that he must bea very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, andsaw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seedsand bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, andbloom.",397
964,It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained thisspeculation.,398
965,"On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed inan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where thebedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of myeyebrows.",398
966,"In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinitybetween seeds and corduroys.",398
967,"Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so didhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about thecorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air andflavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that Ihardly knew which was which.",398
968,"The same opportunity served me fornoticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business bylooking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared toget on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplatingthe baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist.",398
969,"The watchmaker, alwaysporing over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, andalways inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through theglass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in theHigh Street whose trade engaged his attention.",398
970,"Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlourbehind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch ofbread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises.",399
971,I consideredMr. Pumblechook wretched company.,399
972,"Besides being possessed by mysister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to beimparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible incombination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warmwater into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left themilk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing butarithmetic.",399
973,"On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able toanswer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach!",399
974,"Iwas hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sumthat lasted all through the breakfast.",399
975,“Seven?” “And four?” “Andeight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on.,399
976,"And after eachfigure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or asup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)a gorging and gormandizing manner.",399
977,"For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we startedfor Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding themanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof.",400
978,"Within aquarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of oldbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it.",400
979,"Some of thewindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower wererustily barred.",400
980,"There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; sowe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come toopen it.",400
981,"While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), andsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery.",400
982,"No brewingwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long longtime.",400
983,"A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To whichmy conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across thecourt-yard, with keys in her hand.",401
984,"“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”",402
985,"“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty andseemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”",403
986,"Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.",404
987,“Oh!” she said.,405
988,“Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”,405
989,"“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,discomfited.",406
990,“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”,407
991,"She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could notprotest.",408
992,"But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything tohim!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy!",408
993,"Letyour behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up byhand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back topropound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.",408
994,"My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.",409
995,"It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice.",409
996,"Thebrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and thewooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stoodopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.",409
997,"The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and itmade a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of thebrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.",409
998,"She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurtall the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”",410
999,"“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.",411
1000,"“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;don’t you think so?”",412
1001,"“It looks like it, miss.”",413
1002,"“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done with,and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls.",414
1003,"As to strongbeer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the ManorHouse.”",414
1005,"“Is that the name of this house, miss?”",416
1006,"“One of its names, boy.”",417
1007,"“It has more than one, then, miss?”",418
1008,“One more.,419
1009,"Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, orHebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”",419
1010,"“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”",420
1011,"“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said.",421
1012,"It meant, when itwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else.",421
1013,"Theymust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think.",421
1014,"Butdon’t loiter, boy.”",421
1015,"Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that wasfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age.",422
1016,"She seemed mucholder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful andself-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had beenone-and-twenty, and a queen.",422
1017,"We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had twochains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that thepassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.",423
1018,"She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.",423
1019,"At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”",424
1020,"I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”",425
1021,"To this she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle withher.",426
1022,"This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid.",427
1023,"However, the onlything to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was toldfrom within to enter.",427
1024,"I entered, therefore, and found myself in apretty large room, well lighted with wax candles.",427
1025,No glimpse ofdaylight was to be seen in it.,427
1026,"It was a dressing-room, as I supposedfrom the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quiteunknown to me.",427
1027,"But prominent in it was a draped table with a gildedlooking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’sdressing-table.",427
1028,"Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been nofine lady sitting at it, I cannot say.",428
1029,"In an arm-chair, with an elbowresting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat thestrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.",428
1030,"She was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all ofwhite.",429
1031,Her shoes were white.,429
1032,"And she had a long white veil dependentfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair waswhite.",429
1033,"Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, andsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table.",429
1034,"Dresses, less splendidthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.",429
1035,"She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—theother was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom laywith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and someflowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about thelooking-glass.",429
1036,"It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, thoughI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed.",430
1037,"But Isaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had beenwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow.",430
1038,"I sawthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, andlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of hersunken eyes.",430
1039,"I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figureof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose hadshrunk to skin and bone.",430
1040,"Once, I had been taken to see some ghastlywaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personagelying in state.",430
1041,"Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churchesto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out ofa vault under the church pavement.",430
1042,"Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed tohave dark eyes that moved and looked at me.",430
1043,"I should have cried out, ifI could.",430
1044,“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.,431
1045,"“Pip, ma’am.”",432
1046,“Pip?”,433
1047,“Mr.,434
1048,"Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am.",434
1049,Come—to play.”,434
1050,“Come nearer; let me look at you.,435
1051,Come close.”,435
1052,"It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note ofthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stoppedat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped attwenty minutes to nine.",436
1053,"“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham.",437
1054,“You are not afraid of a woman whohas never seen the sun since you were born?”,437
1055,I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous liecomprehended in the answer “No.”,438
1056,"“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one uponthe other, on her left side.",439
1057,"“Yes, ma’am.” (It made me think of the young man.)",440
1058,“What do I touch?”,441
1059,“Your heart.”,442
1060,“Broken!”,443
1061,"She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, andwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.",444
1062,"Afterwards she kepther hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as ifthey were heavy.",444
1063,"“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham.",445
1064,"“I want diversion, and I have donewith men and women.",445
1065,Play.”,445
1066,"I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that shecould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in thewide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.",446
1067,"“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancythat I want to see some play.",447
1068,"There, there!” with an impatient movementof the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”",447
1069,"For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, Ihad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumedcharacter of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.",448
1070,"But I felt myself sounequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at MissHavisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch asshe said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—",448
1071,“Are you sullen and obstinate?”,449
1072,"“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play justnow.",450
1073,"If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, soI would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and sofine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or hadalready said it, and we took another look at each other.",450
1074,"Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at thedress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself inthe looking-glass.",451
1075,"“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, sofamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us!",452
1076,Call Estella.”,452
1077,"As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought shewas still talking to herself, and kept quiet.",453
1078,"“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me.",454
1079,“You can do that.,454
1080,Call Estella.,454
1081,At the door.”,454
1082,"To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible norresponsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,was almost as bad as playing to order.",455
1083,"But she answered at last, andher light came along the dark passage like a star.",455
1084,"Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from thetable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against herpretty brown hair.",456
1085,"“Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use itwell.",456
1086,Let me see you play cards with this boy.”,456
1087,“With this boy?,457
1088,"Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”",457
1089,"I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed sounlikely,—“Well?",458
1090,You can break his heart.”,458
1091,"“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatestdisdain.",459
1092,"“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”",460
1093,"“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella.",461
1094,So we sat down to cards.,461
1095,"It was then I began to understand that everything in the room hadstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago.",462
1096,I noticed thatMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she hadtaken it up.,462
1097,"As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at thedressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, nowyellow, had never been worn.",462
1098,"I glanced down at the foot from which theshoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, nowyellow, had been trodden ragged.",462
1099,"Without this arrest of everything,this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even thewithered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so likegrave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.",462
1100,"So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings andtrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper.",463
1101,"I knewnothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodiesburied in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of beingdistinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must havelooked as if the admission of the natural light of day would havestruck her to dust.",463
1102,"“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,before our first game was out.",464
1103,“And what coarse hands he has!,464
1104,And whatthick boots!”,464
1105,I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began toconsider them a very indifferent pair.,465
1106,"Her contempt for me was sostrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.",465
1107,"She won the game, and I dealt.",466
1108,"I misdealt, as was only natural, when Iknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me fora stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.",466
1109,"“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she lookedon.",467
1110,"“She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her.",467
1111,Whatdo you think of her?”,467
1112,"“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.",468
1113,"“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.",469
1114,"“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.",470
1115,“Anything else?”,471
1116,“I think she is very pretty.”,472
1117,“Anything else?”,473
1118,“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then with alook of supreme aversion.),474
1119,“Anything else?”,475
1120,“I think I should like to go home.”,476
1121,"“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”",477
1122,"“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I shouldlike to go home now.”",478
1123,"“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud.",479
1124,“Play the game out.”,479
1125,"Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost surethat Miss Havisham’s face could not smile.",480
1126,"It had dropped into awatchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things abouther had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever liftit up again.",480
1127,"Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voicehad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.",480
1128,"I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me.",481
1129,"Shethrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if shedespised them for having been won of me.",481
1130,“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham.,482
1131,“Let me think.”,482
1132,"I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when shechecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of herright hand.",483
1133,"“There, there!",484
1134,I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing ofweeks of the year.,484
1135,Come again after six days.,484
1136,You hear?”,484
1137,"“Yes, ma’am.”",485
1138,"“Estella, take him down.",486
1139,"Let him have something to eat, and let himroam and look about him while he eats.",486
1140,"Go, Pip.”",486
1141,"I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and shestood it in the place where we had found it.",487
1142,"Until she opened the sideentrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it mustnecessarily be night-time.",487
1143,"The rush of the daylight quite confoundedme, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strangeroom many hours.",487
1144,"“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared andclosed the door.",488
1145,I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at mycoarse hands and my common boots.,489
1146,My opinion of those accessories wasnot favourable.,489
1147,"They had never troubled me before, but they troubled menow, as vulgar appendages.",489
1148,"I determined to ask Joe why he had evertaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be calledknaves.",489
1149,"I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, andthen I should have been so too.",489
1150,"She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer.",490
1151,"Sheput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread andmeat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog indisgrace.",490
1152,"I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—Icannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its namewas,—that tears started to my eyes.",490
1153,"The moment they sprang there, thegirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause ofthem.",490
1154,"This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, shegave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having madetoo sure that I was so wounded—and left me.",490
1155,"But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my facein, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned mysleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.",491
1156,"As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; sobitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,that needed counteraction.",491
1157,My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive.,492
1158,"In the little world inwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there isnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.",492
1159,"It may beonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child issmall, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as manyhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter.",492
1160,"Withinmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict withinjustice.",492
1161,"I had known, from the time when I could speak, that mysister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me.",492
1162,I hadcherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gaveher no right to bring me up by jerks.,492
1163,"Through all my punishments,disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I hadnursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in asolitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I wasmorally timid and very sensitive.",492
1164,"I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into thebrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed myface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.",493
1165,"The bread and meatwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soonin spirits to look about me.",493
1166,"To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in thebrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some highwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if therehad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it.",494
1167,"But there were nopigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copperor the vat.",494
1168,All the uses and scents of the brewery might haveevaporated with its last reek of smoke.,494
1169,"In a by-yard, there was awilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance ofbetter days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted asa sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I rememberthose recluses as being like most others.",494
1170,"Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an oldwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enoughto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of thehouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there wasa track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimeswalked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then.",495
1171,Butshe seemed to be everywhere.,495
1172,"For when I yielded to the temptationpresented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walkingon them at the end of the yard of casks.",495
1173,"She had her back towards me,and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and neverlooked round, and passed out of my view directly.",495
1174,"So, in the breweryitself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they usedto make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were.",495
1175,"When Ifirst went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near thedoor looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, andascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,as if she were going out into the sky.",495
1176,"It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happenedto my fancy.",496
1177,"I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it astranger thing long afterwards.",496
1178,"I turned my eyes—a little dimmed bylooking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a lownook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figurehanging there by the neck.",496
1179,"A figure all in yellow white, with but oneshoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the fadedtrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face wasMiss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as ifshe were trying to call to me.",496
1180,"In the terror of seeing the figure, andin the terror of being certain that it had not been there a momentbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it.",496
1181,And my terrorwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.,496
1182,"Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight ofpeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the revivinginfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would havebrought me round.",497
1183,"Even with those aids, I might not have come to myselfas soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, tolet me out.",497
1184,"She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, Ithought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.",497
1185,"She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced thatmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened thegate, and stood holding it.",498
1186,"I was passing out without looking at her,when she touched me with a taunting hand.",498
1187,“Why don’t you cry?”,499
1188,“Because I don’t want to.”,500
1189,"“You do,” said she.",501
1190,"“You have been crying till you are half blind, andyou are near crying again now.”",501
1191,"She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.",502
1192,"I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved tofind him not at home.",502
1193,"So, leaving word with the shopman on what day Iwas wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk toour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeplyrevolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit ofcalling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I hadconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-livedbad way.",502
1194,Chapter IX.,504
1195,"When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about MissHavisham’s, and asked a number of questions.",505
1196,"And I soon found myselfgetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and thesmall of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against thekitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficientlength.",505
1197,"If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of otheryoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hiddenin mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason tosuspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to manyreservations.",506
1198,"I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s asmy eyes had seen it, I should not be understood.",506
1199,"Not only that, but Ifelt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; andalthough she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained animpression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in mydragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) beforethe contemplation of Mrs. Joe.",506
1200,"Consequently, I said as little as Icould, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.",506
1201,"The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon bya devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, camegaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the detailsdivulged to him.",507
1202,"And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyesand mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoatheaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.",507
1203,"“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in thechair of honour by the fire.",508
1204,“How did you get on up town?”,508
1205,"I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.",509
1206,“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated.,510
1207,“Pretty well is no answer.,510
1208,"Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”",510
1209,Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacyperhaps.,511
1210,"Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, myobstinacy was adamantine.",511
1211,"I reflected for some time, and then answeredas if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”",511
1212,"My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—Ihad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.Pumblechook interposed with “No!",512
1213,Don’t lose your temper.,512
1214,"Leave this ladto me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned metowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—",512
1215,“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”,513
1216,"I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” andfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which wassomewhere about eightpence off.",514
1217,"Mr. Pumblechook then put me through mypence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pencemake three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he haddone for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which Ireplied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I wasso aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.",514
1218,"Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, andsaid, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, forinstance?”",515
1219,“Yes!” said I.,516
1220,"And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it washighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, andbrought him to a dead stop.",516
1221,“Boy!,517
1222,What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when hehad recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying thescrew.,517
1223,"“Very tall and dark,” I told him.",518
1224,"“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.",519
1225,"Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that hehad never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.",520
1226,“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly.,521
1227,(“This is the way to havehim!,521
1228,"We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)",521
1229,"“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; youknow so well how to deal with him.”",522
1230,"“Now, boy!",523
1231,"What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr.Pumblechook.",523
1232,"“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”",524
1233,"Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they wellmight—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”",525
1234,"“Yes,” said I.",526
1235,"“And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed herin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate.",526
1236,And we all hadcake and wine on gold plates.,526
1237,"And I got up behind the coach to eatmine, because she told me to.”",526
1238,“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.,527
1239,"“Four dogs,” said I.",528
1240,“Large or small?”,529
1241,"“Immense,” said I.",530
1242,“And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silverbasket.”,530
1243,"Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utteramazement.",531
1244,"I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under thetorture,—and would have told them anything.",531
1245,"“Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.",532
1246,“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again.,533
1247,"“But there weren’t anyhorses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejectingfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts ofharnessing.",533
1248,"“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.",534
1249,“What can the boy mean?”,534
1250,"“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook.",535
1251,"“My opinion is, it’s asedan-chair.",535
1252,"She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flightyenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”",535
1253,"“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.",536
1254,"“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never seeher in my life?",537
1255,Never clapped eyes upon her!”,537
1256,"“Goodness, uncle!",538
1257,And yet you have spoken to her?”,538
1258,"“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I havebeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and thedoor has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way.",539
1259,"Don’t say youdon’t know _that_, Mum.",539
1260,"Howsever, the boy went there to play.",539
1261,"What didyou play at, boy?”",539
1262,"“We played with flags,” I said.",540
1263,"(I beg to observe that I think ofmyself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)",540
1264,“Flags!” echoed my sister.,541
1265,"“Yes,” said I.",542
1266,"“Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, andMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, outat the coach-window.",542
1267,And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”,542
1268,“Swords!” repeated my sister.,543
1269,“Where did you get swords from?”,543
1270,"“Out of a cupboard,” said I.",544
1271,"“And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—andpills.",544
1272,"And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted upwith candles.”",544
1273,"“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod.",545
1274,"“That’s thestate of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And then they bothstared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on mycountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trouserswith my right hand.",545
1275,"If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly havebetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning thatthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statementbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bearin the brewery.",546
1276,"They were so much occupied, however, in discussing themarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that Iescaped.",546
1277,The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work tohave a cup of tea.,546
1278,"To whom my sister, more for the relief of her ownmind than for the gratification of his, related my pretendedexperiences.",546
1279,"Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round thekitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but onlyas regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two.",547
1280,"TowardsJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they satdebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’sacquaintance and favour.",547
1281,They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “dosomething” for me; their doubts related to the form that somethingwould take.,547
1282,"My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was infavour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteeltrade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance.",547
1283,"Joe fell into thedeepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that Imight only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for theveal-cutlets.",547
1284,"“If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions thanthat,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had bettergo and do it.” So he went.",547
1285,"After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washingup, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he haddone for the night.",548
1286,"Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, Ishould like to tell you something.”",548
1287,"“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.",549
1288,“Then tell us.,549
1289,"What is it, Pip?”",549
1290,"“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twistingit between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about MissHavisham’s?”",550
1291,“Remember?” said Joe.,551
1292,“I believe you!,551
1293,Wonderful!”,551
1294,"“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”",552
1295,"“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatestamazement.",553
1296,“You don’t mean to say it’s—”,553
1297,"“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”",554
1298,“But not all of it?,555
1299,"Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there wasno black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head.",555
1300,"“But at leastthere was dogs, Pip?",555
1301,"Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if therewarn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”",555
1302,"“No, Joe.”",556
1303,“A dog?” said Joe.,557
1304,“A puppy?,557
1305,Come?”,557
1306,"“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”",558
1307,"As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.",559
1308,"“Pip, old chap!",559
1309,"This won’t do, old fellow!",559
1310,I say!,559
1311,Where do you expectto go to?”,559
1312,"“It’s terrible, Joe; ain’t it?”",560
1313,“Terrible?” cried Joe.,561
1314,“Awful!,561
1315,What possessed you?”,561
1316,"“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirtsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and Iwish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”",562
1317,"And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t beenable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude tome, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’swho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and thatI knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that thelies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how.",563
1318,"This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to dealwith as for me.",564
1319,"But Joe took the case altogether out of the region ofmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.",564
1320,"“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after somerumination, “namely, that lies is lies.",565
1321,"Howsever they come, they didn’tought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round tothe same.",565
1322,"Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip.",565
1323,"_That_ ain’t the way toget out of being common, old chap.",565
1324,"And as to being common, I don’t makeit out at all clear.",565
1325,You are oncommon in some things.,565
1326,You’re oncommonsmall.,565
1327,Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”,565
1328,"“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”",566
1329,"“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night!",567
1330,Wrote in print even!,567
1331,I’veseen letters—Ah!,567
1332,"and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote inprint,” said Joe.",567
1333,"“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe.",568
1334,You think much of me.,568
1335,It’s onlythat.”,568
1336,"“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a commonscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope!",569
1337,"The king uponhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and write his acts ofParliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromotedPrince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the headthat was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.",569
1338,"And _I_ know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly doneit.”",569
1339,"There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouragedme.",570
1340,"“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,reflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for to keep companywith common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommonones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”",571
1341,"“No, Joe.”",572
1342,"“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip).",573
1343,"Whether that might be ormightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without puttingyour sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of asbeing done intentional.",573
1344,"Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by atrue friend.",573
1345,Which this to you the true friend say.,573
1346,"If you can’t get tobe oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it throughgoing crooked.",573

1348,"“You are not angry with me, Joe?”",574
1349,"“No, old chap.",575
1350,"But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay ofa stunning and outdacious sort,—alluding to them which bordered onweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,—a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.",575
1351,"That’s all, old chap, and don’t never do it no more.”",575
1352,"When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forgetJoe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed andunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how commonEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, andhow coarse his hands.",576
1353,"I thought how Joe and my sister were then sittingin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and howMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far abovethe level of such common doings.",576
1354,"I fell asleep recalling what I “usedto do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeksor months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subjectof remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.",576
1355,"That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me.",577

1361,"In pursuance of this luminousconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing toget on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if shewould impart all her learning to me.",580
1362,"Biddy, who was the most obligingof girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out herpromise within five minutes.",580
1363,The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-auntmay be resolved into the following synopsis.,581
1364,"The pupils ate apples andput straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-auntcollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them witha birch-rod.",581
1365,"After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from handto hand.",581
1366,"The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and alittle spelling,—that is to say, it had had once.",581
1367,"As soon as thisvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state ofcoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm.",581
1368,"The pupilsthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on thesubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread thehardest upon whose toes.",581
1369,"This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made arush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if theyhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), moreillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I havesince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having variousspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves.",581
1370,This partof the Course was usually lightened by several single combats betweenBiddy and refractory students.,581
1371,"When the fights were over, Biddy gaveout the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—orwhat we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, orreverence for, what we were reading about.",581
1372,"When this horrible din hadlasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears.",581
1373,"This wasunderstood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged intothe air with shrieks of intellectual victory.",581
1374,"It is fair to remark thatthere was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself witha slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was noteasy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account ofthe little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which wasalso Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being butfaintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candleand no snuffers.",581
1375,"It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, underthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that veryevening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting someinformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head ofmoist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English Dwhich she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which Isupposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.",582
1376,"Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joeliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there.",583
1377,"I had received strict ordersfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, thatevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril.",583
1378,"To theThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.",583
1379,"There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalkscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me tobe never paid off.",584
1380,"They had been there ever since I could remember, andhad grown more than I had.",584
1381,"But there was a quantity of chalk about ourcountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning itto account.",584
1382,"It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly atthese records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, Imerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at theend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, andwhere Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and astranger.",585
1383,"Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and themoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.",585
1384,He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.,586
1385,"His head wasall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he weretaking aim at something with an invisible gun.",586
1386,"He had a pipe in hismouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke awayand looking hard at me all the time, nodded.",586
1387,"So, I nodded, and then henodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sitdown there.",586
1388,"But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place ofresort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe madefor me on the opposite settle.",587
1389,"The strange man, after glancing at Joe,and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me againwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, asit struck me.",587
1390,"“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was ablacksmith.”",588
1391,“Yes.,589
1392,"I said it, you know,” said Joe.",589
1393,"“What’ll you drink, Mr.—?",590
1394,"You didn’t mention your name, by the bye.”",590
1395,"Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it.",591
1396,"“What’llyou drink, Mr. Gargery?",591
1397,At my expense?,591
1398,To top up with?”,591
1399,"“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit ofdrinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”",592
1400,“Habit?,593
1401,"No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on aSaturday night too.",593
1402,Come!,593
1403,"Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”",593
1404,"“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe.",594
1405,“Rum.”,594
1406,"“Rum,” repeated the stranger.",595
1407,“And will the other gentleman originate asentiment.”,595
1408,"“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.",596
1409,"“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.",597
1410,“Glassesround!”,597
1411,"“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,“is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out.",598
1412,Our clerk atchurch.”,598
1413,"“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me.",599
1414,"“Thelonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”",599
1415,"“That’s it,” said Joe.",600
1416,"The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put hislegs up on the settle that he had to himself.",601
1417,"He wore a flappingbroad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied overhis head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair.",601
1418,"As helooked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by ahalf-laugh, come into his face.",601
1419,"“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems asolitary country towards the river.”",602
1420,"“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.",603
1421,"“No doubt, no doubt.",604
1422,"Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, orvagrants of any sort, out there?”",604
1423,"“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then.",605
1424,"And we don’tfind _them_, easy.",605
1425,"Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”",605
1426,"Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;but not warmly.",606
1427,“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.,607
1428,"“Once,” returned Joe.",608
1429,"“Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip.",608
1430,"Didn’t us,Pip?”",608
1431,"“Yes, Joe.”",609
1432,"The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he wereexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He’s alikely young parcel of bones that.",610
1433,What is it you call him?”,610
1434,"“Pip,” said Joe.",611
1435,“Christened Pip?”,612
1436,"“No, not christened Pip.”",613
1437,“Surname Pip?”,614
1438,"“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when ainfant, and is called by.”",615
1439,“Son of yours?”,616
1440,"“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be inanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way atthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that wasdiscussed over pipes,—“well—no.",617
1441,"No, he ain’t.”",617
1442,“Nevvy?” said the strange man.,618
1443,"“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “heis not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy.”",619
1444,“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger.,620
1445,Which appeared to meto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.,620
1446,"Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all aboutrelationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what femalerelations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me andJoe.",621
1447,"Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a mostterrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed tothink he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, “—asthe poet says.”",621
1448,"And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, heconsidered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair andpoke it into my eyes.",622
1449,I cannot conceive why everybody of his standingwho visited at our house should always have put me through the sameinflammatory process under similar circumstances.,622
1450,"Yet I do not call tomind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in oursocial family circle, but some large-handed person took some suchophthalmic steps to patronise me.",622
1451,"All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked atme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring medown.",623
1452,"But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made hisshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.",623
1453,"It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and waspointedly addressed to me.",624
1454,"He stirred his rum and water pointedly atme, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me.",624
1455,"And he stirred itand he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with afile_.",624
1456,He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done ithe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket.,625
1457,"I knew it to be Joe’sfile, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw theinstrument.",625
1458,"I sat gazing at him, spell-bound.",625
1459,"But he now reclined onhis settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principallyabout turnips.",625
1460,"There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pausebefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer onSaturdays than at other times.",626
1461,"The half-hour and the rum and waterrunning out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.",626
1462,"“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man.",627
1463,"“I think I’vegot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, theboy shall have it.”",627
1464,"He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in somecrumpled paper, and gave it to me.",628
1465,“Yours!” said he.,628
1466,“Mind!,628
1467,Your own.”,628
1468,"I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,and holding tight to Joe.",629
1469,"He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a lookwith his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders maybe done with an eye by hiding it.",629
1470,"On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk musthave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door ofthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wideopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.",630
1471,"But I was in amanner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and oldacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.",630
1472,"My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves inthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance totell her about the bright shilling.",631
1473,"“A bad un, I’ll be bound,” saidMrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy!",631
1474,Let’slook at it.”,631
1475,"I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one.",632
1476,"“But what’sthis?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up thepaper.",632
1477,“Two One-Pound notes?”,632
1478,Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed tohave been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-marketsin the county.,633
1479,"Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to theJolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner.",633
1480,"While he was gone, I satdown on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling prettysure that the man would not be there.",633
1481,"Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.",634
1482,"Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them undersome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press inthe state parlour.",634
1483,"There they remained, a nightmare to me, many andmany a night and day.",634
1484,"I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of thestrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of theguiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms ofconspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I hadpreviously forgotten.",635
1485,I was haunted by the file too.,635
1486,"A dread possessedme that when I least expected it, the file would reappear.",635
1487,"I coaxedmyself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and inmy sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing whoheld it, and I screamed myself awake.",635
1488,Chapter XI.,637
1489,"At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitatingring at the gate brought out Estella.",638
1490,"She locked it after admitting me,as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passagewhere her candle stood.",638
1491,"She took no notice of me until she had thecandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliouslysaying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite anotherpart of the house.",638
1492,"The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole squarebasement of the Manor House.",639
1493,"We traversed but one side of the square,however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down andopened a door.",639
1494,"Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in asmall paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by adetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to themanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery.",639
1495,There was a clock in theouter wall of this house.,639
1496,"Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, andlike Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.",639
1497,"We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with alow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back.",640
1498,"There was some company inthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go andstand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, Icrossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state ofmind, looking out.",640
1499,"It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of theneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-treethat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a newgrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as ifthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt.",641
1500,"Thiswas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree.",641
1501,"There had beensome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit ofgarden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at thewindow, as if it pelted me for coming there.",641
1502,"I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and thatits other occupants were looking at me.",642
1503,"I could see nothing of the roomexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened inall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.",642
1504,There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman.,643
1505,"Before I hadbeen standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to methat they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretendednot to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because theadmission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out tobe a toady and humbug.",643
1506,"They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly torepress a yawn.",644
1507,"This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much remindedme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as Ifound when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.",644
1508,"Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she hadany features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of herface.",644
1509,"“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite mysister’s.",645
1510,“Nobody’s enemy but his own!”,645
1511,"“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” saidthe gentleman; “far more natural.”",646
1512,"“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love ourneighbour.”",647
1513,"“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his ownneighbour, who is?”",648
1514,"Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),“The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good ideatoo.",649
1515,"The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely andemphatically, “_Very_ true!”",649
1516,"“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all beenlooking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange!",650
1517,"Would anyonebelieve that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced tosee the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings totheir mourning?",650
1518,"‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify solong as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!",650
1519,The idea!”,650
1520,"“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heavenforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he neverwill have, any sense of the proprieties.”",651
1521,"“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm.",652
1522,"Isaid, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced.",652
1523,I cried about it frombreakfast till dinner.,652
1524,I injured my digestion.,652
1525,"And at last he flung outin his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’ ThankGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantlywent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”",652
1526,"“_He_ paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.",653
1527,"“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returnedCamilla.",654
1528,“_I_ bought them.,654
1529,"And I shall often think of that with peace,when I wake up in the night.”",654
1530,"The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry orcall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted theconversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turninground, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I wentout, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure!",655
1531,"What next!” and Camillaadd, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy!",655
1532,The i-d_e_-a!”,655
1533,"As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estellastopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her tauntingmanner, with her face quite close to mine,—",656
1534,“Well?”,657
1535,"“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.",658
1536,"She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.",659
1537,“Am I pretty?”,660
1538,“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”,661
1539,“Am I insulting?”,662
1540,"“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.",663
1541,“Not so much so?”,664
1542,“No.”,665
1543,"She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my facewith such force as she had, when I answered it.",666
1544,“Now?” said she.,667
1545,"“You little coarse monster, what do you think of menow?”",667
1546,“I shall not tell you.”,668
1547,“Because you are going to tell upstairs.,669
1548,Is that it?”,669
1549,"“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”",670
1550,"“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”",671
1551,"“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I.",672
1552,"Which was, I suppose,as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying forher then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.",672
1553,"We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were goingup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.",673
1554,"“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.",674
1555,"“A boy,” said Estella.",675
1556,"He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with anexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand.",676
1557,He took my chinin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by thelight of the candle.,676
1558,"He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood upbristling.",676
1559,"His eyes were set very deep in his head, and weredisagreeably sharp and suspicious.",676
1560,"He had a large watch-chain, andstrong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if hehad let them.",676
1561,"He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresightthen, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I hadthis opportunity of observing him well.",676
1562,“Boy of the neighbourhood?,677
1563,Hey?” said he.,677
1564,"“Yes, sir,” said I.",678
1565,“How do _you_ come here?”,679
1566,"“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.",680
1567,“Well!,681
1568,Behave yourself.,681
1569,"I have a pretty large experience of boys, andyou’re a bad set of fellows.",681
1570,"Now mind!” said he, biting the side of hisgreat forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”",681
1571,"With those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his handsmelt of scented soap—and went his way downstairs.",682
1572,"I wondered whetherhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or hewould have a quieter and more persuasive manner.",682
1573,"There was not muchtime to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,where she and everything else were just as I had left them.",682
1574,"Estellaleft me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havishamcast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.",682
1575,"“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised: “the days haveworn away, have they?”",683
1576,"“Yes, ma’am.",684
1577,To-day is—”,684
1578,"“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers.",685
1579,“Idon’t want to know.,685
1580,Are you ready to play?”,685
1581,"I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”",686
1582,"“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.",687
1583,"“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”",688
1584,"“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham,impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”",689
1585,"I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able tofind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.",690
1586,"“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the doorbehind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”",691
1587,"I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.",692
1588,"From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it hadan airless smell that was oppressive.",692
1589,"A fire had been lately kindled inthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out thanto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemedcolder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist.",692
1590,"Certain wintrybranches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted thechamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled itsdarkness.",692
1591,"It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, butevery discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, anddropping to pieces.",692
1592,"The most prominent object was a long table with atablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when thehouse and the clocks all stopped together.",692
1593,"An epergne or centre-pieceof some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavilyoverhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember itsseeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders withblotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if somecircumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired inthe spider community.",692
1594,"I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the sameoccurrence were important to their interests.",693
1595,"But the black beetlestook no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in aponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard ofhearing, and not on terms with one another.",693
1596,"These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watchingthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.",694
1597,"In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,and she looked like the Witch of the place.",694
1598,"“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is whereI will be laid when I am dead.",695
1599,They shall come and look at me here.”,695
1600,"With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then andthere and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxworkat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.",696
1601,"“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with herstick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”",697
1602,"“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”",698
1603,“It’s a great cake.,699
1604,A bride-cake.,699
1605,Mine!”,699
1606,"She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!",700
1607,"Walk me, walk me!”",700
1608,"I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk MissHavisham round and round the room.",701
1609,"Accordingly, I started at once, andshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might havebeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.",701
1610,"She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, shetwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me tobelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast.",702
1611,"After awhile she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roaredthat name as I had done on the previous occasion.",702
1612,"When her lightappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again roundand round the room.",702
1613,"If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I shouldhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her thethree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t knowwhat to do.",703
1614,"In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havishamtwitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-facedconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.",703
1615,"“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket.",704
1616,“How well you look!”,704
1617,"“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham.",705
1618,“I am yellow skin and bone.”,705
1619,"Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and shemurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dearsoul!",706
1620,"Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing.",706
1621,The idea!”,706
1622,“And how are _you_?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla.,707
1623,"As we were close toCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only MissHavisham wouldn’t stop.",707
1624,"We swept on, and I felt that I was highlyobnoxious to Camilla.",707
1625,"“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can beexpected.”",708
1626,"“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceedingsharpness.",709
1627,"“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla.",710
1628,"“I don’t wish to make adisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more inthe night than I am quite equal to.”",710
1629,"“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.",711
1630,"“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while ahitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed.",712
1631,“Raymond is awitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.,712
1632,Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs.,712
1633,"Chokingsand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think withanxiety of those I love.",712
1634,"If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves.",712
1635,I am sure Iwish it could be so.,712
1636,"But as to not thinking of you in the night—Theidea!” Here, a burst of tears.",712
1637,"The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, andhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla.",713
1638,"He came to the rescue at thispoint, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, mydear, it is well known that your family feelings are graduallyundermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter thanthe other.”",713
1639,"“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard butonce, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon thatperson, my dear.”",714
1640,"Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugatedold woman, with a small face that might have been made ofwalnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear.",715
1641,Hem!”,715
1642,"“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.",716
1643,"“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.",717
1644,"“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared torise from her legs to her bosom.",718
1645,“It’s all very true!,718
1646,"It’s a weaknessto be so affectionate, but I can’t help it.",718
1647,"No doubt my health would bemuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my dispositionif I could.",718
1648,"It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation toknow I possess it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst offeeling.",718
1649,"Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept goinground and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of thevisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.",719
1650,“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla.,720
1651,"“Never mixing with any natural ties,never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is!",720
1652,"I have taken to the sofawith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with myhead over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t knowwhere—”",720
1653,"(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr.",721
1654,Camilla.),721
1655,"“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account ofMatthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”",722
1656,“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.,723
1657,"“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly viciouspersonage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect tothank you, my love?”",724
1658,"“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumedCamilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymondis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the totalinefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-fortetuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have evensupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—”Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemicalas to the formation of new combinations there.",725
1659,"When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me andherself, and stood looking at the speaker.",726
1660,This change had a greatinfluence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end.,726
1661,"“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly,“when I am laid on that table.",727
1662,"That will be his place,—there,” strikingthe table with her stick, “at my head!",727
1663,And yours will be there!,727
1664,Andyour husband’s there!,727
1665,And Sarah Pocket’s there!,727
1666,And Georgiana’s there!,727
1667,Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feastupon me.,727
1668,And now go!”,727
1669,"At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick ina new place.",728
1670,"She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.",728
1671,"“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but complyand depart.",729
1672,It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love andduty for even so short a time.,729
1673,I shall think of it with a melancholysatisfaction when I wake up in the night.,729
1674,"I wish Matthew could havethat comfort, but he sets it at defiance.",729
1675,"I am determined not to make adisplay of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants tofeast on one’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go.",729
1676,The bare idea!”,729
1677,"Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heavingbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which Isupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out ofview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth.",730
1678,"SarahPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah wastoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artfulslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence.",730
1679,"SarahPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, “Bless you,Miss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on herwalnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.",730
1680,"While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walkedwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly.",731
1681,"At last shestopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at itsome seconds,—",731
1682,"“This is my birthday, Pip.”",732
1683,"I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.",733
1684,“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of.,734
1685,"I don’t suffer those who were herejust now, or any one to speak of it.",734
1686,"They come here on the day, butthey dare not refer to it.”",734
1687,Of course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.,735
1688,"“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap ofdecay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on thetable, but not touching it, “was brought here.",736
1689,It and I have worn awaytogether.,736
1690,"The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth ofmice have gnawed at me.”",736
1691,"She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood lookingat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; theonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a stateto crumble under a touch.",737
1692,"“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and whenthey lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table,—which shallbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much thebetter if it is done on this day!”",738
1693,She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her ownfigure lying there.,739
1694,I remained quiet.,739
1695,"Estella returned, and she tooremained quiet.",739
1696,It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.,739
1697,"In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded inits remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and Imight presently begin to decay.",739
1698,"At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in aninstant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why haveyou not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down asbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havishamwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, andmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast andhair.",740
1699,"Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that shedid not condescend to speak.",741
1700,"When we had played some half-dozen games,a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yardto be fed in the former dog-like manner.",741
1701,"There, too, I was again leftto wander about as I liked.",741
1702,"It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall whichI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that lastoccasion, open or shut.",742
1703,"Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I sawone now.",742
1704,"As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let thevisitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—Istrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it.",742
1705,"It was quite awilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth ofweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then aweedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.",742
1706,"When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it buta fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismalcorner upon which I had looked out of the window.",743
1707,"Never questioning fora moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with apale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.",743
1708,"This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared besideme.",744
1709,"He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,and I now saw that he was inky.",744
1710,"“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”",745
1711,"Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to bebest answered by itself, _I_ said, “Halloa!” politely omitting youngfellow.",746
1712,“Who let _you_ in?” said he.,747
1713,“Miss Estella.”,748
1714,“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”,749
1715,“Miss Estella.”,750
1716,"“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.",751
1717,What could I do but follow him?,752
1718,I have often asked myself the questionsince; but what else could I do?,752
1719,"His manner was so final, and I was soastonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under aspell.",752
1720,"“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gonemany paces.",753
1721,"“I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.",753
1722,"There itis!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands againstone another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled myhair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into mystomach.",753
1723,"The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it wasunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, wasparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat.",754
1724,"I therefore hitout at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha!",754
1725,Wouldyou?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quiteunparalleled within my limited experience.,754
1726,“Laws of the game!” said he.,755
1727,"Here, he skipped from his left leg on tohis right.",755
1728,"“Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on tohis left.",755
1729,"“Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here,he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while Ilooked helplessly at him.",755
1730,"I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I feltmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could havehad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right toconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention.",756
1731,"Therefore, Ifollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed bythe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish.",756
1732,"On his askingme if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, hebegged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returnedwith a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar.",756
1733,"“Available forboth,” he said, placing these against the wall.",756
1734,"And then fell topulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in amanner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.",756
1735,"Although he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, anda breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalledme.",757
1736,"I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and hehad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance.",757
1737,"Forthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded forbattle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably inadvance of the rest of him as to development.",757
1738,"My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with everydemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he wereminutely choosing his bone.",758
1739,"I never have been so surprised in my life,as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedinglyfore-shortened.",758
1740,"But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with agreat show of dexterity began squaring again.",759
1741,"The second greatestsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,looking up at me out of a black eye.",759
1742,His spirit inspired me with great respect.,760
1743,"He seemed to have nostrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knockeddown; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself ordrinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction inseconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an airand a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me atlast.",760
1744,"He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more Ihit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again andagain, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his headagainst the wall.",760
1745,"Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up andturned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at thesame time panting out, “That means you have won.”",760
1746,"He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed thecontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory.",761
1747,"Indeed, I goso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species ofsavage young wolf or other wild beast.",761
1748,"However, I got dressed, darklywiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?”and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and _he_ said“Same to you.”",761
1749,"When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.",762
1750,"But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept herwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as thoughsomething had happened to delight her.",762
1751,"Instead of going straight to thegate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.",762
1752,“Come here!,763
1753,"You may kiss me, if you like.”",763
1754,I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me.,764
1755,I think I would have gonethrough a great deal to kiss her cheek.,764
1756,"But I felt that the kiss wasgiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, andthat it was worth nothing.",764
1757,"What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what withthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home thelight on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleamingagainst a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path offire across the road.",765
1758,Chapter XII.,767
1759,My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.,768
1760,"The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentlemanon his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, themore certain it appeared that something would be done to me.",768
1761,"I feltthat the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Lawwould avenge it.",768
1762,"Without having any definite idea of the penalties Ihad incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not gostalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks andpitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselvesopen to severe punishment.",768
1763,"For some days, I even kept close at home,and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution andtrepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the CountyJail should pounce upon me.",768
1764,"The pale young gentleman’s nose had stainedmy trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in thedead of night.",768
1765,"I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’steeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as Idevised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstancewhen I should be haled before the Judges.",768
1766,"When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed ofviolence, my terrors reached their height.",769
1767,"Whether myrmidons ofJustice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambushbehind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personalvengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in thosegrave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whethersuborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fallupon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was hightestimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; theyalways came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with thefamily features.",769
1768,"However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did.",770
1769,And behold!,770
1770,nothing came of the late struggle.,770
1771,"It was not alluded to in any way,and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises.",770
1772,"Ifound the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked inat the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stoppedby the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless.",770
1773,Only in the cornerwhere the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of theyoung gentleman’s existence.,770
1774,"There were traces of his gore in thatspot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.",770
1775,"On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that otherroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—alight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind.",771
1776,"It had been placedthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regularoccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tiredof walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, andacross the landing, and round the other room.",771
1777,"Over and over and overagain, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last aslong as three hours at a stretch.",771
1778,"I insensibly fall into a generalmention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settledthat I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or tenmonths.",771
1779,"As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked moreto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was Igoing to be?",772
1780,"I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, Ibelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to knoweverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards thatdesirable end.",772
1781,"But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefermy being ignorant.",772
1782,"Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anythingbut my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for myservices.",772
1783,"Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never toldme I might kiss her again.",773
1784,"Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quitefamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that shehated me.",773
1785,"Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when wewere alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I saidyes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily.",773
1786,"Also, whenwe played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relishof Estella’s moods, whatever they were.",773
1787,"And sometimes, when her moodswere so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzledwhat to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavishfondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break theirhearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”",773
1788,"There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of whichthe burden was Old Clem.",774
1789,"This was not a very ceremonious way ofrendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood inthat relation towards smiths.",774
1790,"It was a song that imitated the measureof beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for theintroduction of Old Clem’s respected name.",774
1791,"Thus, you were to hammerboys round—Old Clem!",774
1792,With a thump and a sound—Old Clem!,774
1793,"Beat it out,beat it out—Old Clem!",774
1794,With a clink for the stout—Old Clem!,774
1795,"Blow thefire, blow the fire—Old Clem!",774
1796,"Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!",774
1797,"One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenlysaying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There,there, there!",774
1798,Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as Ipushed her over the floor.,774
1799,It happened so to catch her fancy that shetook it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.,774
1800,"After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was sosubdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise inthe grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.",774
1801,What could I become with these surroundings?,775
1802,How could my characterfail to be influenced by them?,775
1803,"Is it to be wondered at if my thoughtswere dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural lightfrom the misty yellow rooms?",775
1804,"Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I hadnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which Ihad confessed.",776
1805,"Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardlyfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passengerto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing ofhim.",776
1806,"Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estelladiscussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much morepotent as time went on.",776
1807,I reposed complete confidence in no one butBiddy; but I told poor Biddy everything.,776
1808,"Why it came natural to me todo so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I didnot know then, though I think I know now.",776
1809,"Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almostinsupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit.",777
1810,"That ass,Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose ofdiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (tothis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if thesehands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they wouldhave done it.",777
1811,"The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity ofmind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me beforehim,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting mebefore the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,“Now, Mum, here is this boy!",777
1812,Here is this boy which you brought up byhand.,777
1813,"Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them whichso did do.",777
1814,"Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he wouldrumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, asalready hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of anyfellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—aspectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.",777
1815,"Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculationsabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, flyat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over.",778
1816,"In these dialogues, my sisterspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out atevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect ofmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.",778
1817,"In these discussions, Joe bore no part.",779
1818,"But he was often talked at,while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that hewas not favourable to my being taken from the forge.",779
1819,"I was fully oldenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker onhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, mysister would so distinctly construe that innocent action intoopposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker outof his hands, shake him, and put it away.",779
1820,There was a most irritatingend to every one of these debates.,779
1821,"All in a moment, with nothing tolead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catchingsight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come!",779
1822,there’s enough of _you_!,779
1823,"_You_ get along to bed; _you_’ve given troubleenough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favour tobother my life out.",779
1824,"We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that weshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day MissHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on myshoulder; and said with some displeasure,—",780
1825,"“You are growing tall, Pip!”",781
1826,"I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had nocontrol.",782
1827,"She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked atme again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning andmoody.",783
1828,"On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise wasover, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with amovement of her impatient fingers:—",783
1829,“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”,784
1830,"“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”",785
1831,“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”,786
1832,"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”",787
1833,“You had better be apprenticed at once.,788
1834,"Would Gargery come here withyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?”",788
1835,I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to beasked.,789
1836,“Then let him come.”,790
1837,"“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”",791
1838,"“There, there!",792
1839,I know nothing about times.,792
1840,"Let him come soon, and comealong with you.”",792
1841,"When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister“went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previousperiod.",793
1842,"She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-matsunder our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company wegraciously thought she _was_ fit for?",793
1843,"When she had exhausted a torrentof such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loudsobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put onher coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent.",793
1844,"Notsatisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in theback-yard.",793
1845,"It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep inagain, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave atonce?",793
1846,"Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whiskerand looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might havebeen a better speculation.",793
1847,Chapter XIII.,795
1848,"It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joearraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to MissHavisham’s.",796
1849,"However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to theoccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better inhis working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself sodreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was forme he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made thehair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.",796
1850,"At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to townwith us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s and called for “when wehad done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from whichJoe appeared inclined to augur the worst.",797
1851,"The forge was shut up for theday, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom todo on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllableHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in thedirection he had taken.",797
1852,"We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaverbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaitedStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it wasa fine bright day.",798
1853,"I am not quite clear whether these articles werecarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they weredisplayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any othersovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant orprocession.",798
1854,"When we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left us.",799
1855,"As itwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house.",799
1856,"Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joetook his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular tohalf a quarter of an ounce.",799
1857,"Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knewso well.",800
1858,"I followed next to her, and Joe came last.",800
1859,"When I looked backat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with thegreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips ofhis toes.",800
1860,"Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuffand conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence.",801
1861,"She was seated at herdressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.",801
1862,“Oh!” said she to Joe.,802
1863,“You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”,802
1864,"I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself orso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, withhis tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted aworm.",803
1865,"“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of thisboy?”",804
1866,"It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persistedin addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.",805
1867,"“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was atonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and greatpoliteness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the timewhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”",806
1868,“Well!” said Miss Havisham.,807
1869,"“And you have reared the boy, with theintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”",807
1870,"“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and itwere looked for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead tolarks.",808
1871,"Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to thebusiness,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—notbut what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”",808
1872,"“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection?",809
1873,Does helike the trade?”,809
1874,"“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe,strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, andpoliteness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the ideasuddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to theoccasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection onyour part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”",810
1875,It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that heought to speak to Miss Havisham.,811
1876,"The more I made faces and gestures tohim to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, hepersisted in being to Me.",811
1877,“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham.,812
1878,"“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a littleunreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore youknow as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, notto Miss Havisham, but to me.",813
1879,"I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear goodfellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood atthe back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughedmischievously.",813
1880,I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them toMiss Havisham.,813
1881,"“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “nopremium with the boy?”",814
1882,"“Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all.",815
1883,“Why don’t youanswer—”,815
1884,"“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which Imeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourselfand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No.",816
1885,"You know itto be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”",816
1886,"Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really wasbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and tookup a little bag from the table beside her.",817
1887,"“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is.",818
1888,There arefive-and-twenty guineas in this bag.,818
1889,"Give it to your master, Pip.”",818
1890,"As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened inhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,persisted in addressing me.",819
1891,"“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as suchreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,nor nowheres.",820
1892,"And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me asensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if thatfamiliar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap,may we do our duty!",820
1893,"May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one andanother, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—forthe satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that hefelt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantlyrescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” Thesewords had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said themtwice.",820
1894,"“Good-bye, Pip!” said Miss Havisham.",821
1895,"“Let them out, Estella.”",821
1896,"“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked.",822
1897,“No.,823
1898,Gargery is your master now.,823
1899,Gargery!,823
1900,One word!”,823
1901,"Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joein a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, andthat is his reward.",824
1902,"Of course, as an honest man, you will expect noother and no more.”",824
1903,"How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but Iknow that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairsinstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I wentafter him and laid hold of him.",825
1904,"In another minute we were outside thegate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone.",825
1905,"When we stood in thedaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,“Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” atintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never comingback.",825
1906,"At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure _you_this is as-TON-ishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational andable to walk away.",825
1907,"I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by theencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’she invented a subtle and deep design.",826
1908,"My reason is to be found in whattook place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presentingourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.",826
1909,"“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once.",827
1910,“And what’shappened to _you_?,827
1911,"I wonder you condescend to come back to such poorsociety as this, I am sure I do!”",827
1912,"“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort ofremembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her—were itcompliments or respects, Pip?”",828
1913,"“Compliments,” I said.",829
1914,"“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe; “her compliments to Mrs.J. Gargery—”",830
1915,“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratifiedtoo.,831
1916,"“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like anothereffort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s elth weresitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”",832
1917,"“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.",833
1918,"“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe.",834
1919,And drew a long breath.,834
1920,"“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.",835
1921,"“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, butit’s better late than never.",835
1922,And what did she give young Rantipolehere?”,835
1923,"“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”",836
1924,"Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.",837
1925,"“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends.",838
1926,"‘And by hisfriends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sisterMrs. J. Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs.",838
1927,"J. Gargery.’ She mayn’thave know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether itwere Joe, or Jorge.”",838
1928,"My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his woodenarm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known allabout it beforehand.",839
1929,"“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing.",840
1930,Positivelylaughing!,840
1931,“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.,841
1932,"“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well.",842
1933,"Not too much,but pretty well.”",842
1934,"“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe.",843
1935,"That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as herubbed the arms of his chair, “It’s more than that, Mum.”",844
1936,"“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began my sister.",845
1937,"“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit.",846
1938,"Go on, Joseph.",846
1939,Goodin you!,846
1940,Go on!”,846
1941,"“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”",847
1942,"“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.",848
1943,"“Well, then,” said Joe, “It’s more than twenty pound.”",849
1944,"That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with apatronizing laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum.",850
1945,Good again!,850
1946,"Follow herup, Joseph!”",850
1947,"“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag tomy sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”",851
1948,"“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers,Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more thanyour merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joyof the money!”",852
1949,"If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficientlyawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me intocustody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminalityfar behind.",853
1950,"“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by thearm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right throughwith what they’ve begun.",854
1951,"This boy must be bound, out of hand.",854
1952,That’s_my_ way.,854
1953,Bound out of hand.”,854
1954,"“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping themoney), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”",855
1955,"“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical cornchandler.",856
1956,“Apleasure’s a pleasure all the world over.,856
1957,"But this boy, you know; wemust have him bound.",856
1958,I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.”,856
1959,"The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at oncewent over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterialpresence.",857
1960,"I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been takenred-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,I heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others, “He’s a young’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?” One person of mild and benevolentaspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolentyoung man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, andentitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.",857
1961,"The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than achurch,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and withmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, withfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or readingthe newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls,which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake andsticking-plaster.",858
1962,"Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed andattested, and I was “bound”; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the whileas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those littlepreliminaries disposed of.",858
1963,"When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had beenput into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publiclytortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends weremerely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s.",859
1964,"And there mysister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing wouldserve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the BlueBoar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bringthe Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.",859
1965,It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed.,860
1966,"For, itinscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the wholecompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment.",860
1967,"And to make itworse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they hadnothing else to do,—why I didn’t enjoy myself?",860
1968,"And what could Ipossibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,—when I wasn’t!",860
1969,"However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made themost of it.",861
1970,"That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficentcontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and hadfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if Iplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appearedto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chairbeside him to illustrate his remarks.",861
1971,"My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That theywouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,woke me up and told me to enjoy myself.",862
1972,"That, rather late in theevening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’s ode, and threw his bloodstainedsword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in andsaid, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and itwasn’t the Tumblers’ Arms.” That, they were all in excellent spirits onthe road home, and sang, O Lady Fair!",862
1973,"Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, andasserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitivebore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, bywanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that _he_ wasthe man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the wholethe weakest pilgrim going.",862
1974,"Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was trulywretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never likeJoe’s trade.",863
1975,"I had liked it once, but once was not now.",863
1976,Chapter XIV.,865
1977,It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home.,866
1978,"There may beblack ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributiveand well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.",866
1979,"Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister’stemper.",867
1980,"But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it.",867
1981,"I hadbelieved in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believedin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whosesolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I hadbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; Ihad believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood andindependence.",867
1982,Within a single year all this was changed.,867
1983,"Now it was allcoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estellasee it on any account.",867
1984,"How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,how much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is now of no moment tome or to any one.",868
1985,The change was made in me; the thing was done.,868
1986,"Wellor ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.",868
1987,"Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up myshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s ’prentice, I should bedistinguished and happy.",869
1988,"Now the reality was in my hold, I only feltthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weightupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather.",869
1989,"There havebeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when Ihave felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all itsinterest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull enduranceany more.",869
1990,"Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when myway in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newlyentered road of apprenticeship to Joe.",869
1991,"I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand aboutthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing myown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likenessbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on boththere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea.",870
1992,I was quiteas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in thatafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joewhile my indentures lasted.,870
1993,It is about the only thing I _am_ glad toknow of myself in that connection.,870
1994,"For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what Iproceed to add was Joe’s.",871

2001,"I was haunted by the fear that shewould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doingthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.",872
2002,"Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we weresinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at MissHavisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with herpretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often atsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in thewall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw herjust drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come atlast.",872

2011,"In my hunger for information, I made proposals toMr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which hekindly complied.",878
2012,"As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me fora dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept overand bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety ofways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr.Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.",878
2013,"Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe.",879
2014,"This statement sounds sowell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained.",879

2016,"The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a brokenslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educationalimplements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco.",880
2017,"I never knewJoe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire,under my tuition, any piece of information whatever.",880

2020,"It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the riverpassing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low,looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing onat the bottom of the water.",881
2021,"Whenever I watched the vessels standing outto sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of MissHavisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off,upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just thesame.—Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strangelife appeared to have something to do with everything that waspicturesque.",881
2022,"One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himselfon being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I layon the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descryingtraces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the skyand in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thoughtconcerning them that had been much in my head.",882
2023,"“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?”",883

2026,"“What for, Joe?",885
2027,What is any visit made for?”,885
2028,"“There is some wisits p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open tothe question, Pip.",886

2030,"She mightthink you wanted something,—expected something of her.”",886
2031,"“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”",887

2033,“And she might credit it.,888
2034,Similarlyshe mightn’t.”,888
2035,"Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hardat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.",889
2036,"“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, “MissHavisham done the handsome thing by you.",890
2037,"When Miss Havisham done thehandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that wereall.”",890
2038,"“Yes, Joe.",891
2039,I heard her.”,891
2040,"“ALL,” Joe repeated, very emphatically.",892
2041,"“Yes, Joe.",893
2042,"I tell you, I heard her.”",893
2043,"“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,—Make a endon it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep insunders!”",894
2044,"I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me tofind that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it moreprobable.",895
2045,"“But, Joe.”",896
2046,"“Yes, old chap.”",897
2047,"“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the dayof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked afterher, or shown that I remember her.”",898
2048,"“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoesall four round,—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all fourround might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy ofhoofs—”",899
2049,"“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a present.”",900
2050,But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp uponit.,901
2051,"“Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a newchain for the front door,—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screwsfor general use,—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-forkwhen she took her muffins,—or a gridiron when she took a sprat or suchlike—”",901
2052,"“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed.",902
2053,"“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularlypressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t.",903
2054,"No, I would _not_.",903
2055,Forwhat’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up?,903
2056,And shark-headers isopen to misrepresentations.,903
2057,"And if it was a toasting-fork, you’d gointo brass and do yourself no credit.",903
2058,"And the oncommonest workman can’tshow himself oncommon in a gridiron,—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,”said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouringto rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like,but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again yourleave, and you can’t help yourself—”",903
2059,"“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don’tgo on in that way.",904
2060,I never thought of making Miss Havisham anypresent.”,904
2061,"“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, allalong; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”",905
2062,"“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slackjust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think Iwould go uptown and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”",906
2063,"“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip, unless shehave been rechris’ened.”",907
2064,"“I know, Joe, I know.",908
2065,It was a slip of mine.,908
2066,"What do you think of it,Joe?”",908
2067,"In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well ofit.",909
2068,"But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not receivedwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as avisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude fora favour received, then this experimental trip should have nosuccessor.",909
2069,By these conditions I promised to abide.,909
2070,"Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.",910
2071,"Hepretended that his Christian name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—buthe was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him tohave been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully tohave imposed that name upon the village as an affront to itsunderstanding.",910
2072,"He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow ofgreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching.",910
2073,"He never evenseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if bymere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat hisdinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or theWandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intentionof ever coming back.",910
2074,"He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes,and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with hishands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round hisneck and dangling on his back.",910
2075,"On Sundays he mostly lay all day on thesluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns.",910
2076,"He always slouched,locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted orotherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that itwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.",910
2077,This morose journeyman had no liking for me.,911
2078,"When I was very small andtimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black cornerof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it wasnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,and that I might consider myself fuel.",911
2079,"When I became Joe’s ’prentice,Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displacehim; howbeit, he liked me still less.",911
2080,"Not that he ever said anything,or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that healways beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang OldClem, he came in out of time.",911
2081,"Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe ofmy half-holiday.",912
2082,"He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had justgot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but byand by he said, leaning on his hammer,—",912
2083,"“Now, master!",913
2084,Sure you’re not a-going to favour only one of us.,913
2085,"IfYoung Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose hewas about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as anancient person.",913
2086,"“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe.",914
2087,“What’ll _I_ do with it!,915
2088,What’ll _he_ do with it?,915
2089,"I’ll do as much withit as _him_,” said Orlick.",915
2090,"“As to Pip, he’s going up town,” said Joe.",916
2091,"“Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_’s a-going up town,” retorted thatworthy.",917
2092,“Two can go up town.,917
2093,Tain’t only one wot can go up town.,917

2095,"“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick.",919
2096,“Some and their uptowning!,919
2097,"Now,master!",919
2098,Come.,919
2099,No favouring in this shop.,919
2100,Be a man!”,919
2101,"The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman wasin a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hotbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as ifit were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—andfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, andhe again leaned on his hammer,—",920
2102,"“Now, master!”",921
2103,“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe.,922
2104,“Ah!,923
2105,"I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.",923
2106,"“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,” saidJoe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”",924
2107,"My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,—she wasa most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and she instantly looked in atone of the windows.",925
2108,"“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idlehulkers like that.",926
2109,"You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages inthat way.",926
2110,I wish _I_ was his master!”,926
2111,"“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with anill-favoured grin.",927
2112,"(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)",928
2113,"“I’d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my sister,beginning to work herself into a mighty rage.",929
2114,"“And I couldn’t be amatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s thedunder-headed king of the noodles.",929
2115,"And I couldn’t be a match for therogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking andthe worst rogue between this and France.",929
2116,Now!”,929
2117,"“You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,” growled the journeyman.",930
2118,"“If thatmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”",930
2119,"(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)",931
2120,"“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream.",932
2121,“What did yousay?,932
2122,"What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip?",932
2123,"What did he call me,with my husband standing by?",932
2124,Oh!,932
2125,oh!,932
2126,"oh!” Each of these exclamationswas a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true ofall the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse forher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, sheconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herselfinto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was thename he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me?",932
2127,Oh!,932
2128,Holdme!,932
2129,Oh!”,932
2130,"“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold you, ifyou was my wife.",933
2131,"I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”",933
2132,"(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)",934
2133,“Oh!,935
2134,"To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and ascream together,—which was her next stage.",935
2135,“To hear the names he’sgiving me!,935
2136,That Orlick!,935
2137,In my own house!,935
2138,"Me, a married woman!",935
2139,With myhusband standing by!,935
2140,Oh!,935
2141,"Oh!” Here my sister, after a fit of clappingsand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, andthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stageson her road to frenzy.",935
2142,"Being by this time a perfect Fury and a completesuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.",935
2143,"What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parentheticalinterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what hemeant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whetherhe was man enough to come on?",936
2144,"Old Orlick felt that the situationadmitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defencestraightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burntaprons, they went at one another, like two giants.",936
2145,"But, if any man inthat neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.",936
2146,"Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale younggentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to comeout of it.",936
2147,"Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who haddropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, Ithink), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who wasrecommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench herhands in Joe’s hair.",936
2148,"Then came that singular calm and silence whichsucceed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I havealways connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, andsomebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.",936
2150,"When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without anyother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils,which was neither expressive nor ornamental.",938
2151,"A pot of beer had appearedfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in apeaceable manner.",938
2152,"The lull had a sedative and philosophical influenceon Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a partingobservation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off theRampage, Pip:—such is Life!”",938
2153,"With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are veryserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going toMiss Havisham’s, matters little here.",939
2154,"Nor, how I passed and repassedthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring.",939
2155,"Nor, how Idebated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I shouldundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.",939
2156,Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate.,940
2157,No Estella.,940
2158,"“How, then?",941
2159,You here again?” said Miss Pocket.,941
2160,“What do you want?”,941
2161,"When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarahevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about mybusiness.",942
2162,"But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”",942
2163,"Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.",943
2164,"“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me.",944
2165,“I hope you want nothing?,944
2166,You’ll get nothing.”,944
2167,"“No indeed, Miss Havisham.",945
2168,"I only wanted you to know that I am doingvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”",945
2169,"“There, there!” with the old restless fingers.",946
2170,"“Come now and then; comeon your birthday.—Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself and herchair towards me, “You are looking round for Estella?",946
2171,Hey?”,946
2172,"I had been looking round,—in fact, for Estella,—and I stammered that Ihoped she was well.",947
2173,"“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of reach;prettier than ever; admired by all who see her.",948
2174,Do you feel that youhave lost her?”,948
2175,"There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the lastwords, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at aloss what to say.",949
2176,"She spared me the trouble of considering, bydismissing me.",949
2177,"When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of thewalnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with myhome and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by_that_ motion.",949
2178,"As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately atthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle.",950
2179,"Mr. Wopsle had inhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had thatmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it onthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea.",950
2180,"No soonerdid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providencehad put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour.",950
2181,"As Iknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and theway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was betterthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned intoPumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.",950
2182,"As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, Idon’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that ittook until half-past nine o’ clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopslegot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, hebecame so much slower than at any former period of his disgracefulcareer.",951
2183,"I thought it a little too much that he should complain of beingcut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running toseed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began.",951
2184,"This, however, wasa mere question of length and wearisomeness.",951
2185,"What stung me, was theidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self.",951
2186,"WhenBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positivelyapologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it.",951
2187,"Wopsle,too, took pains to present me in the worst light.",951
2188,"At once ferocious andmaudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuatingcircumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on everyoccasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care abutton for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinatingconduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the generalfeebleness of my character.",951
2189,"Even after I was happily hanged and Wopslehad closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking hishead, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were awell-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, providedI could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.",951
2190,"It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out withMr. Wopsle on the walk home.",952
2191,"Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,and it fell wet and thick.",952
2192,"The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out ofthe lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substanceon the fog.",952
2193,"We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rosewith a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when wecame upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.",952
2194,"“Halloa!” we said, stopping.",953
2195,“Orlick there?”,953
2196,"“Ah!” he answered, slouching out.",954
2197,"“I was standing by a minute, on thechance of company.”",954
2198,"“You are late,” I remarked.",955
2199,"Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well?",956
2200,And _you_’re late.”,956
2201,"“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,—“wehave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”",957
2202,"Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we allwent on together.",958
2203,I asked him presently whether he had been spendinghis half-holiday up and down town?,958
2204,"“Yes,” said he, “all of it.",959
2205,I come in behind yourself.,959
2206,"I didn’t seeyou, but I must have been pretty close behind you.",959
2207,"By the by, the gunsis going again.”",959
2208,“At the Hulks?” said I.,960
2209,“Ay!,961
2210,There’s some of the birds flown from the cages.,961

2212,You’ll hear one presently.”,961
2213,"In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when thewell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavilyrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuingand threatening the fugitives.",962
2214,"“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick.",963
2215,"“We’d be puzzled how tobring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”",963
2216,"The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it insilence.",964
2217,"Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’stragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell.",964
2218,"Orlick,with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side.",964
2219,"It was verydark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along.",964
2220,"Now and then, thesound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolledsulkily along the course of the river.",964
2221,I kept myself to myself and mythoughts.,964
2222,"Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly gameon Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury.",964
2223,"Orlicksometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem!",964
2224,"With a clinkfor the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he wasnot drunk.",964
2225,"Thus, we came to the village.",965
2226,"The way by which we approached it took uspast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it beingeleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, andunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scatteredabout.",965
2227,"Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising thata convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.",965
2228,"“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at yourplace, Pip.",966
2229,Run all!”,966
2230,"“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with him.",967
2231,"So did Orlick, at my side.",967
2232,“I can’t quite understand.,968
2233,The house seems to have been violentlyentered when Joe Gargery was out.,968
2234,Supposed by convicts.,968
2235,Somebody hasbeen attacked and hurt.”,968
2236,"We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made nostop until we got into our kitchen.",969
2237,"It was full of people; the wholevillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and therewas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midstof the kitchen.",969
2238,"The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement onthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow onthe back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face wasturned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again,while she was the wife of Joe.",969
2239,Chapter XVI.,971
2240,"With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed tobelieve that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be underobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion thanany one else.",972
2241,"But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I beganto reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on allsides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.",972
2242,"Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from aquarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten.",973
2243,"While he wasthere, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and hadexchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home.",973
2244,"The man could notbe more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got intodense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have beenbefore nine.",973
2245,"When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he foundher struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance.",973
2246,"Thefire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candlevery long; the candle, however, had been blown out.",973
2247,Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house.,974
2248,"Neither, beyondthe blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the doorand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire andwas struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting suchas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding.",974
2249,"But, there was oneremarkable piece of evidence on the spot.",974
2250,"She had been struck withsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows weredealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerableviolence, as she lay on her face.",974
2251,"And on the ground beside her, whenJoe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filedasunder.",974
2252,"Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to havebeen filed asunder some time ago.",975
2253,"The hue and cry going off to theHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion wascorroborated.",975
2254,They did not undertake to say when it had left theprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but theyclaimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not beenworn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night.,975
2255,"Further,one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of hisiron.",975
2256,"Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here.",976
2257,"I believedthe iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard himfiling at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having putit to its latest use.",976
2258,"For I believed one of two other persons to havebecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.",976
2259,"Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.",976
2260,"Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when wepicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all theevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, andhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle.",977
2261,"There was nothing againsthim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and witheverybody else about her, ten thousand times.",977
2262,"As to the strange man; ifhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been nodispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restorethem.",977
2263,"Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come inso silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she couldlook round.",977
2264,"It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, howeverundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise.",978
2265,I sufferedunspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether Ishould at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all thestory.,978
2266,"For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finallyin the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning.",978
2267,"Thecontention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old onenow, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could nottear it away.",978
2268,"In addition to the dread that, having led up to so muchmischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from meif he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would notbelieve it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutletsas a monstrous invention.",978
2269,"However, I temporized with myself, ofcourse—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thingis always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should seeany such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery ofthe assailant.",978
2270,"The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened inthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house fora week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of likeauthorities doing in other such cases.",979
2271,"They took up several obviouslywrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, insteadof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances.",979
2272,"Also, they stoodabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looksthat filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had amysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good astaking the culprit.",979
2273,"But not quite, for they never did it.",979
2274,"Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister layvery ill in bed.",980
2275,"Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objectsmultiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead ofthe realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; andher speech was unintelligible.",980
2276,"When, at last, she came round so far asto be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate alwaysby her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicatein speech.",980
2277,"As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more thanindifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,extraordinary complications arose between them which I was alwayscalled in to solve.",980
2278,"The administration of mutton instead of medicine,the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were amongthe mildest of my own mistakes.",980
2279,"However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient.",981
2280,"Atremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a partof her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or threemonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would thenremain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind.",981
2281,"Wewere at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until acircumstance happened conveniently to relieve us.",981
2282,"Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she hadfallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.",981
2283,"It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in thekitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing thewhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.",982
2284,"Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadlycut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and hadbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to meevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a finefigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking thecleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joebecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change thatdid him good.",982
2285,"It was characteristic of the police people that they hadall more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and thatthey had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepestspirits they had ever encountered.",982
2286,"Biddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty thathad completely vanquished me.",983
2287,"I had tried hard at it, but had madenothing of it.",983
2288,Thus it was:—,983
2289,"Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, acharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmosteagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularlywanted.",984
2290,"I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,from tar to toast and tub.",984
2291,"At length it had come into my head that thesign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in mysister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed aqualified assent.",984
2292,"Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, oneafter another, but without avail.",984
2293,"Then I bethought me of a crutch, theshape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, anddisplayed it to my sister with considerable confidence.",984
2294,"But she shookher head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrifiedlest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.",984
2295,"When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, thismysterious sign reappeared on the slate.",985
2296,"Biddy looked thoughtfully atit, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, lookedthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by hisinitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.",985
2297,"“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face.",986
2298,“Don’t you see?,986
2299,It’s _him_!”,986
2300,"Orlick, without a doubt!",987
2301,"She had lost his name, and could only signifyhim by his hammer.",987
2302,"We told him why we wanted him to come into thekitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with hisarm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that stronglydistinguished him.",987
2303,"I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I wasdisappointed by the different result.",988
2304,"She manifested the greatestanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by hisbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him givensomething to drink.",988
2305,"She watched his countenance as if she wereparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to hisreception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, andthere was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I haveseen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master.",988
2306,"After thatday, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, asif he knew no more than I did what to make of it.",988
2307,Chapter XVII.,990
2308,"I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which wasvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no moreremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my payinganother visit to Miss Havisham.",991
2309,"I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on dutyat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and shespoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.",991
2310,"The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when Iwas going, and told me to come again on my next birthday.",991
2311,I may mentionat once that this became an annual custom.,991
2312,"I tried to decline takingthe guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect thancausing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?",991
2313,"Then, and afterthat, I took it.",991
2314,"So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkenedroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, thatI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in thatmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grewolder, it stood still.",992
2315,"Daylight never entered the house as to mythoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.",992
2316,"It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hatemy trade and to be ashamed of home.",992
2317,"Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.",993
2318,"Hershoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her handswere always clean.",993
2319,"She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could notbe like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.",993
2320,"She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newlyout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myselfone evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyesthat were very pretty and very good.",993
2321,"It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poringat—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways atonce by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I wasabout.",994
2322,"I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework withoutlaying it down.",994
2323,"“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it?",995
2324,"Either I am very stupid, or youare very clever.”",995
2325,“What is it that I manage?,996
2326,"I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.",996
2327,"She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did notmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.",997
2328,"“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn,and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of myknowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside thegreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I haveno doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.",998
2329,"“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how _you_ manage?”",999
2330,"“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can seeme turning to at it.",1000
2331,"But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”",1000
2332,"“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and wenton with her sewing.",1001
2333,"Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked atBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think herrather an extraordinary girl.",1002
2334,"For I called to mind now, that she wasequally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of ourdifferent sorts of work, and our various tools.",1002
2335,"In short, whatever Iknew, Biddy knew.",1002
2336,"Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmithas I, or better.",1002
2337,"“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of everychance.",1003
2338,"You never had a chance before you came here, and see howimproved you are!”",1003
2339,"Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing.",1004
2340,"“I wasyour first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.",1004
2341,"“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement.",1005
2342,"“Why, you are crying!”",1005
2343,"“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing.",1006
2344,“What put that inyour head?”,1006
2345,What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as itdropped on her work?,1007
2346,"I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had beenuntil Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit ofliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people.",1007
2347,"I recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in themiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged andshouldered.",1007
2348,"I reflected that even in those untoward times there musthave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my firstuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter ofcourse.",1007
2349,"Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while Ilooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhapsI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy.",1007
2350,"I might have been tooreserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not usethat precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.",1007
2351,"“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were myfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever beingtogether like this, in this kitchen.”",1008
2352,"“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy.",1009
2353,"It was like her self-forgetfulness totransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”",1009
2354,"“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.",1010
2355,"And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do.",1010
2356,"Let us have aquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”",1010
2357,"My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertookthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went outtogether.",1011
2358,"It was summer-time, and lovely weather.",1011
2359,"When we had passedthe village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on themarshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, Ibegan to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in myusual way.",1011
2360,"When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than itwould have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good timeand place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.",1011
2361,"“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be agentleman.”",1012
2362,"“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned.",1013
2363,“I don’t think it wouldanswer.”,1013
2364,"“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons forwanting to be a gentleman.”",1014
2365,"“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”",1015
2366,"“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am.",1016
2367,I amdisgusted with my calling and with my life.,1016
2368,"I have never taken toeither, since I was bound.",1016
2369,Don’t be absurd.”,1016
2370,"“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorryfor that; I didn’t mean to be.",1017
2371,"I only want you to do well, and to becomfortable.”",1017
2372,"“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can becomfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead avery different sort of life from the life I lead now.”",1018
2373,"“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.",1019
2374,"Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kindof quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was halfinclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gaveutterance to her sentiment and my own.",1020
2375,"I told her she was right, and Iknew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.",1020
2376,"“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the shortgrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelingsout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could havesettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I waslittle, I know it would have been much better for me.",1021
2377,"You and I and Joewould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gonepartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up tokeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on afine Sunday, quite different people.",1021
2378,"I should have been good enough for_you_; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”",1021
2379,"Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned foranswer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely soundedflattering, but I knew she meant well.",1022
2380,"“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a bladeor two, “see how I am going on.",1023
2381,"Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody hadtold me so!”",1023
2382,"Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far moreattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.",1024
2383,"“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” sheremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again.",1025
2384,“Who said it?”,1025
2385,"I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where Iwas going to.",1026
2386,"It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and Ianswered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s morebeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and Iwant to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this lunaticconfession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if Ihad some thoughts of following it.",1026
2387,"“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.",1027
2388,"“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.",1028
2389,"“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—butyou know best—that might be better and more independently done bycaring nothing for her words.",1029
2390,"And if it is to gain her over, I shouldthink—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”",1029
2391,"Exactly what I myself had thought, many times.",1030
2392,Exactly what wasperfectly manifest to me at the moment.,1030
2393,"But how could I, a poor dazedvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best andwisest of men fall every day?",1030
2394,"“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire herdreadfully.”",1031
2395,"In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a goodgrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well.",1032
2396,"Allthe while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad andmisplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my faceright, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against thepebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.",1032
2397,"Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.",1033
2398,"She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened bywork, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of myhair.",1033
2399,"Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while withmy face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in thebrewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-usedby somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which.",1033
2400,"“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have feltyou could give me your confidence, Pip.",1034
2401,"And I am glad of another thing,and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping itand always so far deserving it.",1034
2402,If your first teacher (dear!,1034
2403,"such apoor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!)",1034
2404,"had been yourteacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she wouldset.",1034
2405,"But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,and it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose fromthe bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shallwe walk a little farther, or go home?”",1034
2406,"“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and givingher a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”",1035
2407,"“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.",1036
2408,"“You know I never shall be, so that’s always.",1037
2409,"Not that I have anyoccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as Itold you at home the other night.”",1037
2410,"“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.",1038
2411,"And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk alittle farther, or go home?”",1038
2412,"I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and thesummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was verybeautiful.",1039
2413,"I began to consider whether I was not more naturally andwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playingbeggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stoppedclocks, and being despised by Estella.",1039
2414,"I thought it would be very goodfor me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of thoseremembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relishwhat I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it.",1039
2415,"I askedmyself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella werebeside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?",1039
2416,"I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I saidto myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”",1039
2417,"We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemedright.",1040
2418,"Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day andsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and nopleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded herown breast than mine.",1040
2419,"How could it be, then, that I did not like hermuch the better of the two?",1040
2420,"“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could putme right.”",1041
2421,“I wish I could!” said Biddy.,1042
2422,"“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don’t mind myspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”",1043
2423,"“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy.",1044
2424,“Don’t mind me.”,1044
2425,"“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing forme.”",1045
2426,"“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.",1046
2427,"It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it wouldhave done if we had discussed it a few hours before.",1047
2428,I thereforeobserved I was not quite sure of that.,1047
2429,"But Biddy said she _was_, andshe said it decisively.",1047
2430,"In my heart I believed her to be right; and yetI took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.",1047
2431,"When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, andget over a stile near a sluice-gate.",1048
2432,"There started up, from the gate,or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnantway), Old Orlick.",1048
2433,"“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”",1049
2434,"“Where should we be going, but home?”",1050
2435,"“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”",1051
2436,This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case ofhis.,1052
2437,"He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,and convey an idea of something savagely damaging.",1052
2438,"When I was younger,I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, hewould have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.",1052
2439,"Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,“Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like him either, Itook the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t wantseeing home.",1053
2440,"He received that piece of information with a yell oflaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a littledistance.",1053
2441,"Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand inthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to giveany account, I asked her why she did not like him.",1054
2442,"“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,“because I—I am afraid he likes me.”",1055
2443,“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly.,1056
2444,"“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told meso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”",1057
2445,"However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did notdoubt the accuracy of the interpretation.",1058
2446,I was very hot indeed uponOld Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage onmyself.,1058
2447,"“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.",1059
2448,"“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’tapprove of it.”",1060
2449,"“Nor I neither,” said Biddy.",1061
2450,“Though _that_ makes no difference toyou.”,1061
2451,"“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion ofyou, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”",1062
2452,"I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstanceswere favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure thatdemonstration.",1063
2453,"He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason ofmy sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get himdismissed.",1063
2454,"He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, asI had reason to know thereafter.",1063
2455,"And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicatedits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when Iwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that theplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to beashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect andhappiness.",1064
2456,"At those times, I would decide conclusively that mydisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I wasgrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep companywith Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of theHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, andscatter my wits again.",1064
2457,"Scattered wits take a long time picking up; andoften before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed inall directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all MissHavisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.",1064
2458,"If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of myperplexities, I dare say.",1065
2459,"It never did run out, however, but wasbrought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.",1065
2460,Chapter XVIII.,1067
2461,"It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was aSaturday night.",1068
2462,"There was a group assembled round the fire at the ThreeJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.",1068
2463,Of that group I was one.,1068
2464,"A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbruedin blood to the eyebrows.",1069
2465,"He gloated over every abhorrent adjective inthe description, and identified himself with every witness at theInquest.",1069
2466,"He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and hebarbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer.",1069
2467,"He gavethe medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heardblows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regardingthe mental competency of that witness.",1069
2468,"The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’shands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus.",1069
2469,"He enjoyedhimself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfullycomfortable.",1069
2470,In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict WilfulMurder.,1069
2471,"Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaningover the back of the settle opposite me, looking on.",1070
2472,"There was anexpression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a greatforefinger as he watched the group of faces.",1070
2473,"“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,“you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”",1071
2474,"Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer.",1072
2475,He lookedat everybody coldly and sarcastically.,1072
2476,"“Guilty, of course?” said he.",1073
2477,“Out with it.,1073
2478,Come!”,1073
2479,"“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of youracquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unitein a confirmatory murmur.",1074
2480,"“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would.",1075
2481,I told you so.,1075
2482,But now I’ll ask you a question.,1075
2483,"Do you know, or do you not know, thatthe law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he isproved—proved—to be guilty?”",1075
2484,"“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”",1076
2485,"“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him.",1077
2486,“Don’t evadethe question.,1077
2487,"Either you know it, or you don’t know it.",1077
2488,Which is it tobe?”,1077
2489,"He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in abullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.",1078
2490,“Now!” said he.,1079
2491,"“Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”",1079
2492,"“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.",1080
2493,“Certainly you know it.,1081
2494,Then why didn’t you say so at first?,1081
2495,"Now, I’llask you another question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if hehad a right to him,—“_do_ you know that none of these witnesses haveyet been cross-examined?”",1081
2496,"Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stoppedhim.",1082
2497,“What?,1083
2498,"You won’t answer the question, yes or no?",1083
2499,"Now, I’ll try youagain.” Throwing his finger at him again.",1083
2500,“Attend to me.,1083
2501,"Are you aware,or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet beencross-examined?",1083
2502,"Come, I only want one word from you.",1083
2503,"Yes, or no?”",1083
2504,"Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a pooropinion of him.",1084
2505,"“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you.",1085
2506,"You don’t deserve help, butI’ll help you.",1085
2507,Look at that paper you hold in your hand.,1085
2508,What is it?”,1085
2509,"“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.",1086
2510,"“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspiciousmanner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”",1087
2511,“Undoubtedly.”,1088
2512,“Undoubtedly.,1089
2513,"Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether itdistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legaladvisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”",1089
2514,"“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.",1090
2515,"“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you readjust now.",1091
2516,"You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like,—and,perhaps, have done it before to-day.",1091
2517,Turn to the paper.,1091
2518,"No, no, no myfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to thebottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full ofsubterfuge.)",1091
2519,“Well?,1091
2520,Have you found it?”,1091
2521,"“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.",1092
2522,"“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether itdistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he wasinstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence?",1093
2523,Come!,1093
2524,Do you make that of it?”,1093
2525,"Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”",1094
2526,“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman bitterly.,1095
2527,“Is that theexact substance?”,1095
2528,"“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.",1096
2529,"“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the companywith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle.",1097
2530,"“And now Iask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with thatpassage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after havingpronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”",1097
2531,"We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thoughthim, and that he was beginning to be found out.",1098
2532,"“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing hisfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as ajuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committedhimself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head uponhis pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and trulytry the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and theprisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to theevidence, so help him God!”",1099
2533,"We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone toofar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yettime.",1100
2534,"The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, andwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one ofus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose todisclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the spacebetween the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remainedstanding, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger ofhis right.",1101
2535,"“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as weall quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmithamong you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery.",1102
2536,Which is the man?”,1102
2537,"“Here is the man,” said Joe.",1103
2538,"The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.",1104
2539,"“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?",1105
2540,Is he here?”,1105
2541,“I am here!” I cried.,1106
2542,"The stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as thegentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visitto Miss Havisham.",1107
2543,"I had known him the moment I saw him looking over thesettle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon myshoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his darkcomplexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his largewatch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even thesmell of scented soap on his great hand.",1107
2544,"“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when hehad surveyed me at his leisure.",1108
2545,“It will take a little time.,1108
2546,Perhaps wehad better go to your place of residence.,1108
2547,I prefer not to anticipate mycommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as youplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”,1108
2548,"Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,and in a wondering silence walked home.",1109
2549,"While going along, the strangegentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side ofhis finger.",1109
2550,"As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasionas an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the frontdoor.",1109
2551,"Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feeblylighted by one candle.",1109
2552,"It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in hispocket-book.",1110
2553,"He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a littleaside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, toascertain which was which.",1110
2554,"“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London.",1111
2555,I ampretty well known.,1111
2556,"I have unusual business to transact with you, and Icommence by explaining that it is not of my originating.",1111
2557,"If my advicehad been asked, I should not have been here.",1111
2558,"It was not asked, and yousee me here.",1111
2559,"What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, Ido.",1111
2560,"No less, no more.”",1111
2561,"Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he gotup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thushaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.",1112
2562,"“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you ofthis young fellow your apprentice.",1113
2563,You would not object to cancel hisindentures at his request and for his good?,1113
2564,You would want nothing forso doing?”,1113
2565,"“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’sway,” said Joe, staring.",1114
2566,"“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.Jaggers.",1115
2567,"“The question is, Would you want anything?",1115
2568,Do you wantanything?”,1115
2569,"“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”",1116
2570,"I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a foolfor his disinterestedness.",1117
2571,"But I was too much bewildered betweenbreathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.",1117
2572,"“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers.",1118
2573,"“Recollect the admission you have made,and don’t try to go from it presently.”",1118
2574,“Who’s a-going to try?” retorted Joe.,1119
2575,“I don’t say anybody is.,1120
2576,Do you keep a dog?”,1120
2577,"“Yes, I do keep a dog.”",1121
2578,"“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.",1122
2579,"Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyesand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.",1122
2580,"“Now, I return to this young fellow.",1122
2581,"And the communication I have gotto make is, that he has great expectations.”",1122
2582,"Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.",1123
2583,"“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing hisfinger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.",1124
2584,"Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of thatproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere oflife and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,—in a word,as a young fellow of great expectations.”",1124
2585,My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; MissHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.,1125
2586,"“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I haveto say, to you.",1126
2587,"You are to understand, first, that it is the request ofthe person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear thename of Pip.",1126
2588,"You will have no objection, I dare say, to your greatexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition.",1126
2589,"But if you haveany objection, this is the time to mention it.”",1126
2590,"My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.",1127
2591,“I should think not!,1128
2592,"Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, thatthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains aprofound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it.",1128
2593,I am empoweredto mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at firsthand by word of mouth to yourself.,1128
2594,"When or where that intention may becarried out, I cannot say; no one can say.",1128
2595,It may be years hence.,1128
2596,"Now,you are distinctly to understand that you are most positivelyprohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion orreference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_individual, in all the communications you may have with me.",1128
2597,"If you havea suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.",1128
2598,"It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibitionare; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be merewhim.",1128
2599,This is not for you to inquire into.,1128
2600,The condition is laid down.,1128
2601,"Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is theonly remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person fromwhom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwiseresponsible.",1128
2602,"That person is the person from whom you derive yourexpectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.",1128
2603,"Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such arise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the timeto mention it.",1128
2604,Speak out.”,1128
2605,"Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.",1129
2606,“I should think not!,1130
2607,"Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, hestill could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; andeven now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me whilehe spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to mydisparagement, if he only chose to mention them.",1130
2608,"“We come next, to meredetails of arrangement.",1130
2609,"You must know that, although I have used theterm ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed withexpectations only.",1130
2610,There is already lodged in my hands a sum of moneyamply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance.,1130
2611,You willplease consider me your guardian.,1130
2612,"Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “Itell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t renderthem.",1130
2613,"It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordancewith your altered position, and that you will be alive to theimportance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”",1130
2614,I said I had always longed for it.,1131
2615,"“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted;“keep to the record.",1132
2616,"If you long for it now, that’s enough.",1132
2617,Am Ianswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some propertutor?,1132
2618,Is that it?”,1132
2619,"I stammered yes, that was it.",1133
2620,“Good.,1134
2621,"Now, your inclinations are to be consulted.",1134
2622,"I don’t think thatwise, mind, but it’s my trust.",1134
2623,Have you ever heard of any tutor whomyou would prefer to another?”,1134
2624,"I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt;so, I replied in the negative.",1135
2625,"“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I thinkmight suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers.",1136
2626,"“I don’t recommend him,observe; because I never recommend anybody.",1136
2627,The gentleman I speak of isone Mr. Matthew Pocket.”,1136
2628,Ah!,1137
2629,I caught at the name directly.,1137
2630,Miss Havisham’s relation.,1137
2631,TheMatthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of.,1137
2632,"The Matthew whoseplace was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in herbride’s dress on the bride’s table.",1137
2633,"“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and thenshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.",1138
2634,"My answer was, that I had heard of the name.",1139
2635,“Oh!” said he.,1140
2636,“You have heard of the name.,1140
2637,"But the question is, whatdo you say of it?”",1140
2638,"I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for hisrecommendation—",1141
2639,"“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head veryslowly.",1142
2640,“Recollect yourself!”,1142
2641,"Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to himfor his recommendation—",1143
2642,"“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowningand smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it’s very well done, but itwon’t do; you are too young to fix me with it.",1144
2643,"Recommendation is notthe word, Mr. Pip.",1144
2644,Try another.”,1144
2645,"Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for hismention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—",1145
2646,"“_That_’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I wouldgladly try that gentleman.",1146
2647,“Good.,1147
2648,You had better try him in his own house.,1147
2649,"The way shall beprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London.",1147
2650,Whenwill you come to London?”,1147
2651,"I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that Isupposed I could come directly.",1148
2652,"“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to comein, and they should not be working-clothes.",1149
2653,Say this day week.,1149
2654,You’llwant some money.,1149
2655,Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”,1149
2656,"He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted themout on the table and pushed them over to me.",1150
2657,This was the first time hehad taken his leg from the chair.,1150
2658,"He sat astride of the chair when hehad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.",1150
2659,"“Well, Joseph Gargery?",1151
2660,You look dumbfoundered?”,1151
2661,"“I _am_!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.",1152
2662,"“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”",1153
2663,"“It were understood,” said Joe.",1154
2664,“And it are understood.,1154
2665,And it everwill be similar according.”,1154
2666,"“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,—“what if it was in myinstructions to make you a present, as compensation?”",1155
2667,“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.,1156
2668,“For the loss of his services.”,1157
2669,Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.,1158
2670,"I haveoften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man orpat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness.",1158
2671,"“Pipis that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, tohonour and fortun’, as no words can tell him.",1158
2672,But if you think as Moneycan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what cometo the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”,1158
2673,"O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, Isee you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes,and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away.",1159
2674,"O dear goodfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon myarm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’swing!",1159
2675,But I encouraged Joe at the time.,1160
2676,"I was lost in the mazes of my futurefortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together.",1160
2677,"Ibegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the bestof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so.",1160
2678,"Joe scooped his eyeswith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, butsaid not another word.",1160
2679,"Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe thevillage idiot, and in me his keeper.",1161
2680,"When it was over, he said,weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:—",1161
2681,"“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance.",1162
2682,No halfmeasures with me.,1162
2683,"If you mean to take a present that I have it incharge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it.",1162
2684,"If on thecontrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stoppedby Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fellpugilistic purpose.",1162
2685,"“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my placebull-baiting and badgering me, come out!",1163
2686,"Which I meantersay as sech ifyou’re a man, come on!",1163
2687,"Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersayand stand or fall by!”",1163
2688,"I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating tome, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to anyone whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to bebull-baited and badgered in his own place.",1164
2689,"Mr. Jaggers had risen whenJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door.",1164
2690,"Without evincing anyinclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictoryremarks.",1164
2691,They were these.,1164
2692,"“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be agentleman—the better.",1165
2693,"Let it stand for this day week, and you shallreceive my printed address in the meantime.",1165
2694,"You can take ahackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight tome.",1165
2695,"Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on thetrust I undertake.",1165
2696,"I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so.",1165
2697,"Now,understand that, finally.",1165
2698,Understand that!”,1165
2699,"He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have goneon, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.",1166
2700,"Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as hewas going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hiredcarriage.",1167
2701,"“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”",1168
2702,"“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”",1169
2703,"“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;so I thought I had better ask.",1170
2704,"Would there be any objection to mytaking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”",1170
2705,"“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.",1171
2706,"“I don’t mean in the village only, but up town?”",1172
2707,"“No,” said he.",1173
2708,“No objection.”,1173
2709,"I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe hadalready locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and wasseated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently atthe burning coals.",1174
2710,"I too sat down before the fire and gazed at thecoals, and nothing was said for a long time.",1174
2711,"My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat ather needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat nextJoe in the corner opposite my sister.",1175
2712,"The more I looked into theglowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; thelonger the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.",1175
2713,"At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”",1176
2714,"“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding hisknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended tomake off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”",1177
2715,"“I would rather you told, Joe.”",1178
2716,"“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him init!”",1179
2717,"Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me.",1180
2718,Joe held his knees and lookedat me.,1180
2719,I looked at both of them.,1180
2720,"After a pause, they both heartilycongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in theircongratulations that I rather resented.",1180
2721,"I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) withthe grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing andsay nothing about the maker of my fortune.",1181
2722,"It would all come out ingood time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.",1181
2723,"Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her workagain, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaininghis knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and thenthey congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder atthe notion of my being a gentleman that I didn’t half like it.",1181
2724,Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister someidea of what had happened.,1182
2725,"To the best of my belief, those effortsentirely failed.",1182
2726,"She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But Idoubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and Icannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.",1182
2727,"I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddybecame more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.",1183
2728,"Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it ispossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfiedwith myself.",1183
2729,"Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, andabout what they should do without me, and all that.",1184
2730,"And whenever Icaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and theyoften looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if theywere expressing some mistrust of me.",1184
2731,Though Heaven knows they never didby word or sign.,1184
2732,"At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchendoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer eveningsto air the room.",1185
2733,"The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I amafraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on therustic objects among which I had passed my life.",1185
2734,"“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheeseand beer.",1186
2735,"“Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day!",1186
2736,They’llsoon go.”,1186
2737,"“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.",1187
2738,“They’ll soon go.”,1187
2739,"“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.",1188
2740,"“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, andorder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and putthem on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s.",1189
2741,Itwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”,1189
2742,“Mr.,1190
2743,"and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figuretoo, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheeseon it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supperas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices.",1190
2744,“So mightWopsle.,1190
2745,And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”,1190
2746,"“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe.",1191
2747,"They would make such a business ofit,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn’t bear myself.”",1191
2748,"“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe.",1192
2749,“If you couldn’t abear yourself—”,1192
2750,"Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have youthought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sisterand me?",1193
2751,You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”,1193
2752,"“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quickthat it’s difficult to keep up with you.”",1194
2753,"(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)",1195
2754,"“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me saythat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likelyon the evening before I go away.”",1196
2755,Biddy said no more.,1197
2756,"Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged anaffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed.",1197
2757,"When Igot into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as amean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,for ever.",1197
2758,"It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and evenat the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mindbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been inso often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.",1197
2759,"The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, andthe room was warm.",1198
2760,"As I put the window open and stood looking out, Isaw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn ortwo in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe andlight it for him.",1198
2761,"He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to methat he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.",1198
2762,"He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking hispipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knewthat they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearingtone by both of them more than once.",1199
2763,"I would not have listened formore, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, andsat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful andstrange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be theloneliest I had ever known.",1199
2764,"Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipefloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—notobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we sharedtogether.",1200
2765,"I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasybed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.",1200
2766,Chapter XIX.,1202
2767,"Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same.",1203
2768,"What layheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervenedbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of amisgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, andthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated orclean gone.",1203
2769,Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of ourapproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did.,1204
2770,"Afterbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the bestparlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free.",1204
2771,"Withall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about therich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.",1204
2772,"After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish offthe marshes at once, and get them done with.",1205
2773,"As I passed the church, Ifelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassionfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday afterSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among thelow green mounds.",1205
2774,"I promised myself that I would do something for themone of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinnerof roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon ofcondescension, upon everybody in the village.",1205
2775,"If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of mycompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping amongthose graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the placerecalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron andbadge!",1206
2776,"My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that hehad doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead tome, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.",1206
2777,"No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of thesegrazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear amore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they mightstare as long as possible at the possessor of such greatexpectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work ingeneral, and for you!",1207
2778,"I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havishamintended me for Estella, fell asleep.",1207
2779,"When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,smoking his pipe.",1208
2780,"He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening myeyes, and said,—",1208
2781,"“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”",1209
2782,"“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”",1210
2783,"“Thankee, Pip.”",1211
2784,"“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands,“that I shall never forget you.”",1212
2785,"“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “_I_’m sure of that.",1213
2786,"Ay, ay, old chap!",1213
2787,"Bless you, it were only necessary to get it wellround in a man’s mind, to be certain on it.",1213
2788,"But it took a bit of timeto get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”",1213
2789,"Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure ofme.",1214
2790,"I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,“It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort.",1214
2791,"Therefore, I madeno remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that thetidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be agentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if Iwere one.",1214
2792,“Have you though?” said Joe.,1215
2793,“Astonishing!”,1215
2794,"“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”",1216
2795,"“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe.",1217
2796,“I’m so awful dull.,1217
2797,I’m only masterof my own trade.,1217
2798,"It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’sno more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”",1217
2799,"What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able todo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he hadbeen better qualified for a rise in station.",1218
2800,"He was so perfectlyinnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it toBiddy in preference.",1218
2801,"So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into ourlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in ageneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should neverforget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.",1219
2802,"“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity ofhelping Joe on, a little.”",1220
2803,"“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.",1221
2804,“Well!,1222
2805,"Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearestfellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things.",1222
2806,"Forinstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”",1222
2807,"Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened hereyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.",1223
2808,"“O, his manners!",1224
2809,"won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking ablack-currant leaf.",1224
2810,"“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”",1225
2811,“O!,1226
2812,"they _do_ very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely atthe leaf in her hand.",1226
2813,"“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as Ishall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they wouldhardly do him justice.”",1227
2814,“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.,1228
2815,"It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the mostdistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—",1229
2816,"“Biddy, what do you mean?”",1230
2817,"Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and thesmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me thatevening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have younever considered that he may be proud?”",1231
2818,"“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.",1232
2819,“O!,1233
2820,"there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me andshaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”",1233
2821,“Well?,1234
2822,What are you stopping for?” said I.,1234
2823,"“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy.",1235
2824,"“He may be too proud to let anyone take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fillswell and with respect.",1235
2825,"To tell you the truth, I think he is; though itsounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than Ido.”",1235
2826,"“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you.",1236
2827,I did notexpect to see this in you.,1236
2828,"You are envious, Biddy, and grudging.",1236
2829,"Youare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t helpshowing it.”",1236
2830,"“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so.",1237
2831,"Say soover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”",1237
2832,"“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in avirtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me.",1238
2833,"I am very sorryto see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature.",1238
2834,"I did intend toask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I wasgone, of improving dear Joe.",1238
2835,But after this I ask you nothing.,1238
2836,"I amextremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated.",1238
2837,“It’s a—it’s abad side of human nature.”,1238
2838,"“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you mayequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, atall times.",1239
2839,"And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make nodifference in my remembrance of you.",1239
2840,"Yet a gentleman should not beunjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.",1239
2841,"I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (inwhich sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason tothink I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate andtook a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it verysorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my brightfortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.",1240
2842,"But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemencyto Biddy, and we dropped the subject.",1241
2843,"Putting on the best clothes Ihad, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having hisbreakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think itworth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.",1241
2844,"“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way.",1242
2845,"“How areyou, and what can I do for you?”",1242
2846,"Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and wasslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up.",1243
2847,"He was aprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperouslittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe letinto the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt thatheaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.",1243
2848,“Mr.,1244
2849,"Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsomeproperty.”",1244
2850,A change passed over Mr. Trabb.,1245
2851,"He forgot the butter in bed, got upfrom the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,“Lord bless my soul!”",1245
2852,"“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing someguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionablesuit of clothes to go in.",1246
2853,"I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise Ithought he might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”",1246
2854,"“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, openedhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of eachelbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that.",1247
2855,May I venture to congratulateyou?,1247
2856,Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”,1247
2857,Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.,1248
2858,"When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened hislabours by sweeping over me.",1248
2859,"He was still sweeping when I came out intothe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possiblecorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality withany blacksmith, alive or dead.",1248
2860,"“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “orI’ll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir.",1249
2861,"Now,this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it outin a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his handunder it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article.",1249
2862,"I can recommendit for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super.",1249
2863,But youshall see some others.,1249
2864,"Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and witha dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’sbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)",1249
2865,Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he haddeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.,1250
2866,"Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight.",1250
2867,"“And letme have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repentit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”",1250
2868,"Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferentialconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, anarticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that itwould ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguishedfellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) havingworn.",1251
2869,"“Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop andbring them myself?”",1251
2870,"I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’sjudgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured.",1252
2871,"For although Mr.Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contentedwith it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existingcircumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured andcalculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finestspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that Ifelt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for hispains.",1252
2872,"When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articlesto Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his handupon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot beexpected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me aturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteemit.",1252
2873,"Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”",1252
2874,"The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion whatit meant.",1253
2875,"But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with hishands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of moneywas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb’s boy.",1253
2876,"After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and thebootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’sdog whose outfit required the services of so many trades.",1254
2877,I also wentto the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturdaymorning.,1254
2878,"It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had comeinto a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attentiondiverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated hismind upon me.",1254
2879,"When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed mysteps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’splace of business, I saw him standing at his door.",1254
2880,He was waiting for me with great impatience.,1255
2881,"He had been out early withthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news.",1255
2882,"He hadprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too orderedhis shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.",1255
2883,"“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, whenhe and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your goodfortune.",1256
2884,"Well deserved, well deserved!”",1256
2885,"This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way ofexpressing himself.",1257
2886,"“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me forsome moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leadingup to this, is a proud reward.”",1258
2887,"I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever saidor hinted, on that point.",1259
2888,"“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me tocall you so—”",1260
2889,"I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both handsagain, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had anemotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear youngfriend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keepingthe fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, inthe way of a compassionate adjuration.",1261
2890,“Joseph!!,1261
2891,Joseph!!,1261
2892,"!” Thereuponhe shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency inJoseph.",1261
2893,"“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry,you must be exhausted.",1262
2894,Be seated.,1262
2895,"Here is a chicken had round from theBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or twolittle things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.",1262
2896,"But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after hehad sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times ofhappy infancy?",1262
2897,And may I—_may_ I—?”,1262
2898,"This May I, meant might he shake hands?",1263
2899,"I consented, and he wasfervent, and then sat down again.",1263
2900,"“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook.",1264
2901,"“Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment!",1264
2902,"And yet Icannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—andlikewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?”",1264
2903,"I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied hisglass and turned it upside down.",1265
2904,"I did the same; and if I had turnedmyself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone moredirect to my head.",1265
2905,"Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice oftongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), andtook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all.",1266
2906,“Ah!,1266
2907,"poultry,poultry!",1266
2908,"You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising thefowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in storefor you.",1266
2909,"You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath thishumble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I?",1266
2910,_may_ I—?”,1266
2911,"It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so hedid it at once.",1267
2912,"How he ever did it so often without wounding himselfwith my knife, I don’t know.",1267
2913,"“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which hadthe honour of bringing you up by hand!",1268
2914,"It’s a sad picter, to reflectthat she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour.",1268
2915,May—”,1268
2916,"I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.",1269
2917,"“We’ll drink her health,” said I.",1270
2918,"“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccidwith admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know whoSir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third personpresent); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir!",1271
2919,Everforgiving and ever affable.,1271
2920,"It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to acommon person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”",1271
2921,"When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister.",1272
2922,"“Letus never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, butit is to be hoped she meant well.”",1272
2923,"At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed inthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.",1273
2924,"I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothessent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him.",1274
2925,"Imentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,and he lauded it to the skies.",1274
2926,"There was nobody but himself, heintimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he?",1274
2927,"Then heasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how wehad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how hehad ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend?",1274
2928,"If I had takenten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that henever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart ofhearts have repudiated the idea.",1274
2929,"Yet for all that, I remember feelingconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was asensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.",1274
2930,"By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to askmy advice in reference to his own affairs.",1275
2931,"He mentioned that there wasan opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn andseed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurredbefore in that or any other neighbourhood.",1275
2932,"What alone was wanting tothe realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.",1275
2933,"Those were the two little words, more capital.",1275
2934,"Now it appeared to him(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, througha sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing todo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine thebooks,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in hispocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that thatmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined withproperty, which would be worthy of his attention.",1275
2935,But what did I think?,1275
2936,"He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think?",1275
2937,I gave itas my opinion.,1275
2938,"“Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness ofthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shakehands with me, but said he really must,—and did.",1275
2939,"We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over andover again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), andto render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know whatservice).",1276
2940,"He also made known to me for the first time in my life, andcertainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he hadalways said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’will be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was asingular thing to think of now, and I said so too.",1276
2941,"Finally, I went outinto the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwontedin the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously gotto the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.",1276
2942,"There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me.",1277
2943,"He was a long waydown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me tostop.",1277
2944,"I stopped, and he came up breathless.",1277
2945,"“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.",1278
2946,“Not if I can help it.,1278
2947,"This occasion shall not entirely pass withoutthat affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?",1278
2948,_May_ I?”,1278
2949,"We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a youngcarter out of my way with the greatest indignation.",1279
2950,"Then, he blessed meand stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in theroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedgebefore I pursued my way home.",1279
2951,"I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the littleI possessed was adapted to my new station.",1280
2952,"But I began packing thatsame afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should wantnext morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.",1280
2953,"So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning Iwent to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit toMiss Havisham.",1281
2954,"Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dressin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event.",1281
2955,"Myclothes were rather a disappointment, of course.",1281
2956,"Probably every new andeagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell atrifle short of the wearer’s expectation.",1281
2957,"But after I had had my newsuit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity ofposturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in thefutile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better.",1281
2958,"It beingmarket morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.Pumblechook was not at home.",1281
2959,"I had not told him exactly when I meant toleave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again beforedeparting.",1281
2960,"This was all as it should be, and I went out in my newarray, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspiciousafter all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’sin his Sunday suit.",1281
2961,"I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rangat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of mygloves.",1282
2962,"Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back whenshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turnedfrom brown to green and yellow.",1282
2963,“You?” said she.,1283
2964,“You?,1283
2965,Good gracious!,1283
2966,What do you want?”,1283
2967,"“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-byeto Miss Havisham.”",1284
2968,"I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she wentto ask if I were to be admitted.",1285
2969,"After a very short delay, she returnedand took me up, staring at me all the way.",1285
2970,"Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spreadtable, leaning on her crutch stick.",1286
2971,"The room was lighted as of yore,and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned.",1286
2972,She was thenjust abreast of the rotted bride-cake.,1286
2973,"“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said.",1287
2974,"“Well, Pip?”",1287
2975,"“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedinglycareful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my takingleave of you.”",1288
2976,"“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick playround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, werebestowing the finishing gift.",1289
2977,"“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, MissHavisham,” I murmured.",1290
2978,"“And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”",1290
2979,"“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, withdelight.",1291
2980,“I have seen Mr. Jaggers.,1291
2981,"_I_ have heard about it, Pip.",1291
2982,So yougo to-morrow?”,1291
2983,"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”",1292
2984,“And you are adopted by a rich person?”,1293
2985,"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”",1294
2986,“Not named?”,1295

2989,"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”",1298
2990,"She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was herenjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay.",1299
2991,“Well!” she went on; “youhave a promising career before you.,1299
2992,"Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, andSarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.",1299
2993,"“Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”",1299
2994,"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”",1300
2995,"“Good-bye, Pip!”",1301
2996,"She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to mylips.",1302
2997,I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it camenaturally to me at the moment to do this.,1302
2998,"She looked at Sarah Pocketwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, withboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimlylighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.",1302
2999,"Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seenout.",1303
3000,"She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degreeconfounded.",1303
3001,"I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, anddid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken.",1303
3002,"Clear of thehouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my newclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I hadthe bundle to carry.",1303
3003,"And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had runout fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face moresteadily than I could look at it.",1304
3004,"As the six evenings had dwindledaway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and moreappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy.",1304
3005,"On this last evening, Idressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in mysplendour	 until bedtime.",1304
3006,"We had a hot supper on the occasion,graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finishwith.",1304
3007,"We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be inspirits.",1304
3008,"I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my littlehand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away allalone.",1305
3009,"I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my senseof the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to thecoach together.",1305
3010,"I had pretended with myself that there was nothing ofthis taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room onthis last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and hadan impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me inthe morning.",1305
3011,I did not.,1305
3012,"All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong placesinstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, nowpigs, now men,—never horses.",1306
3013,Fantastic failures of journeys occupied meuntil the day dawned and the birds were singing.,1306
3014,"Then, I got up andpartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and intaking it fell asleep.",1306
3015,"Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did notsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire whenI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in theafternoon.",1307
3016,"But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinkingof the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to godownstairs.",1307
3017,"After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking andunstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,until Biddy called to me that I was late.",1307
3018,It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it.,1308
3019,"I got up from the meal,saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,“Well!",1308
3020,"I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who waslaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,and threw my arms around Joe’s neck.",1308
3021,Then I took up my littleportmanteau and walked out.,1308
3022,"The last I saw of them was, when Ipresently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwingan old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe.",1308
3023,"I stoppedthen, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm abovehis head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to herface.",1308
3024,"I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I hadsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done tohave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the HighStreet.",1309
3025,I whistled and made nothing of going.,1309
3026,"But the village was verypeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if toshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and allbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heaveand sob I broke into tears.",1309
3027,"It was by the finger-post at the end of thevillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,dear friend!”",1309
3028,"Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rainupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.",1310
3029,"I wasbetter after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my owningratitude, more gentle.",1310
3030,"If I had cried before, I should have had Joewith me then.",1310
3031,"So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in thecourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it wasclear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I wouldnot get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have anotherevening at home, and a better parting.",1311
3032,"We changed, and I had not madeup my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quitepracticable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.",1311
3033,"And whileI was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exactresemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and myheart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!",1311
3034,"We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far togo back, and I went on.",1312
3035,"And the mists had all solemnly risen now, andthe world lay spread before me.",1312
3036,THIS IS THE END OF THE FIRST STAGE OF PIP’S EXPECTATIONS.,1313
3037,Chapter XX.,1315
3038,The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about fivehours.,1316
3039,"It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach bywhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out aboutthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.",1316
3040,"We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it wastreasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think Imight have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,crooked, narrow, and dirty.",1317
3041,"Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, andhe had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and closeby the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed tohave as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packedme up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrierof steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles.",1318
3042,"His getting onhis box, which I remember to have been decorated with an oldweather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite awork of time.",1318
3043,"It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronetsoutside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen tohold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen fromyielding to the temptation.",1318
3044,"I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like astraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why thehorses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachmanbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently.",1319
3045,"And stopwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an opendoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.",1319
3046,“How much?” I asked the coachman.,1320
3047,"The coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”",1321
3048,I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.,1322
3049,"“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman.",1323
3050,“I don’t want toget into trouble.,1323
3051,"_I_ know _him_!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.Jaggers’s name, and shook his head.",1323
3052,"When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed theascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve hismind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in myhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?",1324
3053,"“He is not,” returned the clerk.",1325
3054,“He is in Court at present.,1325
3055,Am Iaddressing Mr. Pip?”,1325
3056,I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.,1326
3057,“Mr.,1327
3058,"Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room.",1327
3059,"He couldn’t say howlong he might be, having a case on.",1327
3060,"But it stands to reason, his timebeing valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”",1327
3061,"With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an innerchamber at the back.",1328
3062,"Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in avelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve onbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.",1328
3063,"“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.",1329
3064,"I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerkshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.",1330
3065,"Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a mostdismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twistedthemselves to peep down at me through it.",1331
3066,"There were not so many papersabout, as I should have expected to see; and there were some oddobjects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an oldrusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes andpackages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarlyswollen, and twitchy about the nose.",1331
3067,"Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backedchair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, andbit his forefinger at the clients.",1331
3068,"The room was but small, and theclients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; thewall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy withshoulders.",1331
3069,"I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffledforth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his beingturned out.",1331
3070,"I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’schair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place.",1332
3071,"Icalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something toeverybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had.",1332
3072,"I wondered how manyother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to havethe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures.",1332
3073,"I wondered whatwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it camethere.",1332
3074,"I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’sfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of suchill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for theblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.",1332
3075,"Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spiritsmay have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust andgrit that lay thick on everything.",1332
3076,"But I sat wondering and waiting inMr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two castson the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.",1332
3077,"When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while Iwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come intoSmithfield.",1333
3078,"So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, beingall asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick tome.",1333
3079,"So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into astreet where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at mefrom behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was NewgatePrison.",1333
3080,"Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway coveredwith straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, andfrom the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spiritsand beer, I inferred that the trials were on.",1333
3081,"While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunkminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear atrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for halfa crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justicein his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, andpresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence.",1334
3082,"As Ideclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good asto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and alsowhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interestof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in themorning, to be killed in a row.",1334
3083,"This was horrible, and gave me asickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’sproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to hispocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently notbelonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he hadbought cheap of the executioner.",1334
3084,Under these circumstances I thoughtmyself well rid of him for a shilling.,1334
3085,"I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and Ifound he had not, and I strolled out again.",1335
3086,"This time, I made the tourof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I becameaware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well asI.",1335
3087,"There were two men of secret appearance lounging in BartholomewClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of thepavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other whenthey first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, andone of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comfortedher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggersis for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was ared-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loiteringthere, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of ahighly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under alamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with thewords, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth!",1335
3088,"all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardianmade a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more thanever.",1335
3089,"At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Closeinto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towardsme.",1336
3090,"All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and therewas quite a rush at him.",1336
3091,"Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder andwalking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressedhimself to his followers.",1336
3092,"First, he took the two secret men.",1337
3093,"“Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing hisfinger at them.",1338
3094,“I want to know no more than I know.,1338
3095,"As to the result,it’s a toss-up.",1338
3096,I told you from the first it was a toss-up.,1338
3097,Have youpaid Wemmick?”,1338
3098,"“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’s face.",1339
3099,"“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made itup at all.",1340
3100,Has Wemmick got it?”,1340
3101,"“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.",1341
3102,“Very well; then you may go.,1342
3103,"Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers,waving his hand at them to put them behind him.",1342
3104,"“If you say a word tome, I’ll throw up the case.”",1342
3105,"“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat.",1343
3106,"“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers.",1344
3107,“_You_ thought!,1344
3108,Ithink for you; that’s enough for you.,1344
3109,"If I want you, I know where tofind you; I don’t want you to find me.",1344
3110,Now I won’t have it.,1344
3111,I won’thear a word.”,1344
3112,"The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behindagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.",1345
3113,"“And now _you_!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning onthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meeklyseparated,—“Oh!",1346
3114,"Amelia, is it?”",1346
3115,"“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”",1347
3116,"“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me youwouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”",1348
3117,"“O yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together.",1349
3118,"“Lord bless you, sir, wellwe knows that!”",1349
3119,"“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”",1350
3120,"“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.",1351
3121,"“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers.",1352
3122,“Once for all.,1352
3123,"If you don’tknow that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it.",1352
3124,"And if you come herebothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill andyou, and let him slip through my fingers.",1352
3125,Have you paid Wemmick?”,1352
3126,"“O yes, sir!",1353
3127,Every farden.”,1353
3128,“Very well.,1354
3129,Then you have done all you have got to do.,1354
3130,Say anotherword—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”,1354
3131,This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.,1355
3132,"Noone remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised theskirts of Mr. Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.",1355
3133,"“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastatingstrain: “What does this fellow want?”",1356
3134,“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth.,1357
3135,Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”,1357
3136,“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers.,1358
3137,“Let go of my coat.”,1358
3138,"The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishingit, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”",1359
3139,"“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers.",1360
3140,“I am over the way.”,1360
3141,"“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”",1361
3142,"“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it.",1362
3143,Get out of theway.”,1362
3144,“Mithter Jaggerth!,1363
3145,Half a moment!,1363
3146,"My hown cuthen’th gone to MithterWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth.",1363

3150,"My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, andleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot.",1364
3151,"Without furtherinterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk andthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.",1364
3152,"“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, andapproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.",1365
3153,"“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock ofhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pullingat the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon.",1366
3154,Well?”,1366
3155,"“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from aconstitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, asmight do.”",1367
3156,“What is he prepared to swear?”,1368
3157,"“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap thistime; “in a general way, anythink.”",1369
3158,Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate.,1370
3159,"“Now, I warned you before,”said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if youever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you.",1370
3160,"Youinfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”",1370
3161,"The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconsciouswhat he had done.",1371
3162,"“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with hiselbow.",1372
3163,“Soft Head!,1372
3164,Need you say it face to face?”,1372
3165,"“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly,“once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here isprepared to swear?”",1373
3166,"Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lessonfrom his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to havingbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.”",1374
3167,"“Now, be careful.",1375
3168,In what station of life is this man?”,1375
3169,"Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at theceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, beforebeginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—”when my guardian blustered out,—",1376
3170,“What?,1377
3171,"You WILL, will you?”",1377
3172,"(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)",1378
3173,"After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—",1379
3174,“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman.,1380
3175,A sort of a pastry-cook.”,1380
3176,“Is he here?” asked my guardian.,1381
3177,"“I left him,” said Mike, “a setting on some doorsteps round thecorner.”",1382
3178,"“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”",1383
3179,The window indicated was the office window.,1384
3180,"We all three went to it,behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in anaccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a shortsuit of white linen and a paper cap.",1384
3181,"This guileless confectioner wasnot by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage ofrecovery, which was painted over.",1384
3182,"“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to theclerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing sucha fellow as that.”",1385
3183,"My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemedto bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangementshe had made for me.",1386
3184,"I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; Iwas to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to gowith him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I likedit.",1386
3185,"Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberalone,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cardsof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,and such other things as I could in reason want.",1386
3186,"“You will find yourcredit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smeltlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall bythis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I findyou outrunning the constable.",1386
3187,"Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, butthat’s no fault of mine.”",1386
3188,"After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I askedMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach?",1387
3189,"He said it was not worthwhile, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,if I pleased.",1387
3190,I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room.,1388
3191,"Another clerkwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and Iaccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.",1388
3192,"We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a wayamong them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; hewon’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,and went on side by side.",1388
3193,Chapter XXI.,1390
3194,"Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he waslike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short instature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to havebeen imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel.",1391
3195,"There were somemarks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had beensofter and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.",1391
3196,"The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishmentover his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth themoff.",1391
3197,"I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of hislinen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; forhe wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing alady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it.",1391
3198,"I noticed, too,that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he werequite laden with remembrances of departed friends.",1391
3199,"He had glitteringeyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips.",1391
3200,"He had hadthem, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.",1391
3201,“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.,1392
3202,"“No,” said I.",1393
3203,"“_I_ was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick.",1394
3204,“Rum to think of now!”,1394
3205,“You are well acquainted with it now?”,1395
3206,"“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick.",1396
3207,“I know the moves of it.”,1396
3208,"“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of sayingsomething than for information.",1397
3209,"“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London.",1398
3210,"But there areplenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”",1398
3211,"“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it offa little.",1399
3212,“O!,1400
3213,"I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s notmuch bad blood about.",1400
3214,"They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got byit.”",1400
3215,“That makes it worse.”,1401
3216,“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick.,1402
3217,"“Much about the same, I shouldsay.”",1402
3218,"He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight beforehim: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in thestreets to claim his attention.",1403
3219,His mouth was such a post-office of amouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling.,1403
3220,"We had got to thetop of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanicalappearance, and that he was not smiling at all.",1403
3221,“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick.,1404
3222,"“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction.",1405
3223,"“At Hammersmith, west ofLondon.”",1405
3224,“Is that far?”,1406
3225,“Well!,1407
3226,Say five miles.”,1407
3227,“Do you know him?”,1408
3228,"“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at mewith an approving air.",1409
3229,"“Yes, I know him.",1409
3230,_I_ know him!”,1409
3231,"There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance ofthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sidewaysat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn.",1410
3232,"My depression was notalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishmentto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our townwas a mere public-house.",1410
3233,"Whereas I now found Barnard to be adisembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collectionof shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a clubfor Tom-cats.",1410
3234,"We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by anintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to melike a flat burying-ground.",1411
3235,"I thought it had the most dismal trees init, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and themost dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had everseen.",1411
3236,"I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which thosehouses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind andcurtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserablemakeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul ofBarnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of thepresent occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel.",1411
3237,"A frowzymourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance andhumiliation as a mere dust-hole.",1411
3238,"Thus far my sense of sight; while dryrot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof andcellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at handbesides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,“Try Barnard’s Mixture.”",1411
3239,"So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my greatexpectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick.",1412
3240,"“Ah!” said he,mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country.",1412
3241,So it doesme.”,1412
3242,"He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—whichappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one ofthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and findthemselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers onthe top floor.",1413
3243,"MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there wasa label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”",1413
3244,"“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained.",1414
3245,“Youdon’t want me any more?”,1414
3246,"“No, thank you,” said I.",1415
3247,"“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meetpretty often.",1416
3248,Good day.”,1416
3249,“Good day.”,1417
3250,"I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if hethought I wanted something.",1418
3251,"Then he looked at me, and said, correctinghimself,—",1418
3252,“To be sure!,1419
3253,Yes.,1419
3254,You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”,1419
3255,"I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,but said yes.",1420
3256,"“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last.",1421
3257,"Veryglad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance.",1421
3258,Good day!”,1421
3259,"When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase windowand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and itcame down like the guillotine.",1422
3260,Happily it was so quick that I had notput my head out.,1422
3261,"After this escape, I was content to take a foggy viewof the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefullylooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.",1422
3262,"Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearlymaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written myname with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in thewindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs.",1423
3263,"Gradually there arosebefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of amember of society of about my own standing.",1423
3264,"He had a paper-bag undereach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out ofbreath.",1423
3265,“Mr.,1424
3266,Pip?” said he.,1424
3267,“Mr.,1425
3268,Pocket?” said I.,1425
3269,“Dear me!” he exclaimed.,1426
3270,"“I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was acoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you wouldcome by that one.",1426
3271,"The fact is, I have been out on your account,—notthat that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, youmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent GardenMarket to get it good.”",1426
3272,"For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of myhead.",1427
3273,"I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to thinkthis was a dream.",1427
3274,"“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior.",1428
3275,“This door sticks so!”,1428
3276,"As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door whilethe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to holdthem.",1429
3277,"He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated withthe door as if it were a wild beast.",1429
3278,"It yielded so suddenly at last,that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the oppositedoor, and we both laughed.",1429
3279,"But still I felt as if my eyes must startout of my head, and as if this must be a dream.",1429
3280,"“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior.",1430
3281,“Allow me to lead the way.,1430
3282,"Iam rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerablywell till Monday.",1430
3283,"My father thought you would get on more agreeablythrough to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walkabout London.",1430
3284,I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you.,1430
3285,"Asto our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be suppliedfrom our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at yourexpense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions.",1430
3286,"As to our lodging, it’snot by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and myfather hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to takeit, if he had.",1430
3287,"This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tablesand carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home.",1430
3288,"Youmustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,because they come for you from the coffee-house.",1430
3289,"This is my littlebedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty.",1430
3290,"This is your bedroom;the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer thepurpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it.",1430
3291,"Thechambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’tfight, I dare say.",1430
3292,"But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding thefruit all this time.",1430
3293,Pray let me take these bags from you.,1430
3294,I am quiteashamed.”,1430
3295,"As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that Iknew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,—",1431
3296,"“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”",1432
3297,"“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”",1433
3298,Chapter XXII.,1435
3299,"The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another inBarnard’s Inn, until we both burst out laughing.",1436
3300,“The idea of its beingyou!” said he.,1436
3301,“The idea of its being _you_!” said I.,1436
3302,"And then wecontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again.",1436
3303,"“Well!” said thepale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s allover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgiveme for having knocked you about so.”",1436
3304,I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was thepale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention withhis execution.,1437
3305,"But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.",1437
3306,“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said HerbertPocket.,1438
3307,"“No,” said I.",1439
3308,"“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately.",1440
3309,_I_ wasrather on the lookout for good fortune then.”,1440
3310,“Indeed?”,1441
3311,“Yes.,1442
3312,"Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancyto me.",1442
3313,"But she couldn’t,—at all events, she didn’t.”",1442
3314,I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.,1443
3315,"“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact.",1444
3316,"Yes, she had sent forme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, Isuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have beenwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.”",1444
3317,"“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.",1445
3318,"He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided hisattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.",1446
3319,"“Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit.",1446
3320,“Betrothed.,1446
3321,Engaged.,1446
3322,What’s-his-named.,1446
3323,Any word of that sort.”,1446
3324,“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.,1447
3325,"“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it.",1448
3326,_She’s_ a Tartar.”,1448
3327,“Miss Havisham?”,1449
3328,"“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella.",1450
3329,"That girl’s hard andhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up byMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”",1450
3330,“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”,1451
3331,"“None,” said he.",1452
3332,“Only adopted.”,1452
3333,“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex?,1453
3334,What revenge?”,1453
3335,"“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he.",1454
3336,“Don’t you know?”,1454
3337,"“No,” said I.",1455
3338,“Dear me!,1456
3339,"It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time.",1456
3340,Andnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question.,1456
3341,"How did you comethere, that day?”",1456
3342,"I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burstout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?",1457
3343,"I didn’t askhim if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectlyestablished.",1457
3344,“Mr.,1458
3345,"Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on.",1458
3346,“Yes.”,1459
3347,"“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor, and hasher confidence when nobody else has?”",1460
3348,This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground.,1461
3349,"I answered witha constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggersin Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never atany other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of havingever seen me there.",1461
3350,"“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and hecalled on my father to propose it.",1462
3351,Of course he knew about my fatherfrom his connection with Miss Havisham.,1462
3352,"My father is Miss Havisham’scousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for heis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”",1462
3353,Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.,1463
3354,"I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, whomore strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a naturalincapacity to do anything secret and mean.",1463
3355,"There was somethingwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at thesame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich.",1463
3356,Idon’t know how this was.,1463
3357,"I became imbued with the notion on that firstoccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by whatmeans.",1463
3358,"He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conqueredlanguor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that didnot seem indicative of natural strength.",1464
3359,"He had not a handsome face,but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.",1464
3360,"His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles hadtaken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always belight and young.",1464
3361,"Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat moregracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am consciousthat he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carriedoff my new suit.",1464
3362,"As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be abad return unsuited to our years.",1465
3363,"I therefore told him my small story,and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.",1465
3364,"I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in acountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I wouldtake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint wheneverhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.",1465
3365,"“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’llwant very few hints.",1466
3366,"I dare say we shall be often together, and Ishould like to banish any needless restraint between us.",1466
3367,"Will you do methe favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”",1466
3368,I thanked him and said I would.,1467
3369,I informed him in exchange that myChristian name was Philip.,1467
3370,"“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moralboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious thathe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go abird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy inthe neighbourhood.",1468
3371,I tell you what I should like.,1468
3372,"We are so harmonious,and you have been a blacksmith,—would you mind it?”",1468
3373,"“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’tunderstand you.”",1469
3374,“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name?,1470
3375,"There’s a charming piece ofmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”",1470
3376,“I should like it very much.”,1471
3377,"“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened,“here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of thetable, because the dinner is of your providing.”",1472
3378,"This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him.",1473
3379,"It was anice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and itacquired additional relish from being eaten under those independentcircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.",1473
3380,"This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set thebanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might havesaid, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from thecoffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of acomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiterthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fellover them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on thebookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl intomy bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butterin a state of congelation when I retired for the night.",1473
3381,"All this madethe feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, mypleasure was without alloy.",1473
3382,"We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of hispromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.",1474
3383,"“True,” he replied.",1475
3384,“I’ll redeem it at once.,1475
3385,"Let me introduce thetopic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to putthe knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the forkis reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary.",1475
3386,"Itis scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other peopledo.",1475
3387,"Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under.",1475
3388,Thishas two advantages.,1475
3389,"You get at your mouth better (which after all isthe object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of openingoysters, on the part of the right elbow.”",1475
3390,"He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that weboth laughed and I scarcely blushed.",1476
3391,"“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham.",1477
3392,"Miss Havisham, you mustknow, was a spoilt child.",1477
3393,"Her mother died when she was a baby, and herfather denied her nothing.",1477
3394,"Her father was a country gentleman down inyour part of the world, and was a brewer.",1477
3395,"I don’t know why it should bea crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while youcannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never wasand brew.",1477
3396,You see it every day.”,1477
3397,“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.,1478
3398,"“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep agentleman.",1479
3399,Well!,1479
3400,Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud.,1479
3401,So was hisdaughter.”,1479
3402,“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.,1480
3403,"“Stop a moment, I am coming to that.",1481
3404,"No, she was not an only child; shehad a half-brother.",1481
3405,"Her father privately married again—his cook, Irather think.”",1481
3406,"“I thought he was proud,” said I.",1482
3407,"“My good Handel, so he was.",1483
3408,"He married his second wife privately,because he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died.",1483
3409,"When she wasdead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and thenthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you areacquainted with.",1483
3410,"As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad.",1483
3411,"At last his father disinheritedhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, thoughnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine,and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one tobe so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn itbottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”",1483
3412,"I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital.",1484
3413,"Ithanked him, and apologised.",1484
3414,"He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.",1484
3415,"“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked afteras a great match.",1485
3416,"Her half-brother had now ample means again, but whatwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.",1485
3417,"There were stronger differences between him and her than there had beenbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished adeep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father’sanger.",1485
3418,"Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off,my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into atumbler.”",1485
3419,"Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable tosay.",1486
3420,"I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of amuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress itwithin those limits.",1486
3421,"Again I thanked him and apologised, and again hesaid in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.",1486
3422,"“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to MissHavisham.",1487
3423,"I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention thathe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose.",1487
3424,"But that hewas not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for agentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is aprinciple of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart everwas, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner.",1487
3425,"He says, novarnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish youput on, the more the grain will express itself.",1487
3426,Well!,1487
3427,"This man pursuedMiss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her.",1487
3428,"I believeshe had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all thesusceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and shepassionately loved him.",1487
3429,There is no doubt that she perfectly idolizedhim.,1487
3430,"He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he gotgreat sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother outof a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by hisfather) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husbandhe must hold and manage it all.",1487
3431,"Your guardian was not at that time inMiss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in loveto be advised by any one.",1487
3432,"Her relations were poor and scheming, withthe exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving orjealous.",1487
3433,"The only independent one among them, he warned her that shewas doing too much for this man, and was placing herself toounreservedly in his power.",1487
3434,"She took the first opportunity of angrilyordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father hasnever seen her since.”",1487
3435,"I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at lastwhen I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether hisfather was so inveterate against her?",1488
3436,"“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of herintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning uponher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it wouldlook true—even to him—and even to her.",1489
3437,To return to the man and make anend of him.,1489
3438,"The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses werebought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests wereinvited.",1489
3439,"The day came, but not the bridegroom.",1489
3440,He wrote her a letter—”,1489
3441,"“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for hermarriage?",1490
3442,At twenty minutes to nine?”,1490
3443,"“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which sheafterwards stopped all the clocks.",1491
3444,"What was in it, further than that itmost heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because Idon’t know.",1491
3445,"When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, shelaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has neversince looked upon the light of day.”",1491
3446,"“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.",1492
3447,"“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing itout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when MissHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it wasabsolutely requisite I should understand.",1493
3448,But I have forgotten onething.,1493
3449,It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplacedconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that itwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”,1493
3450,"“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.",1494
3451,"“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may havebeen a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert.",1495
3452,“Mind!,1495
3453,I don’tknow that.”,1495
3454,"“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering thesubject.",1496
3455,“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—andruin.”,1497
3456,“Are they alive now?”,1498
3457,“I don’t know.”,1499
3458,"“You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, butadopted.",1500
3459,When adopted?”,1500
3460,Herbert shrugged his shoulders.,1501
3461,"“There has always been an Estella,since I have heard of a Miss Havisham.",1501
3462,I know no more.,1501
3463,"And now,Handel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there isa perfectly open understanding between us.",1501
3464,"All that I know about MissHavisham, you know.”",1501
3465,"“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”",1502
3466,“I fully believe it.,1503
3467,So there can be no competition or perplexitybetween you and me.,1503
3468,"And as to the condition on which you hold youradvancement in life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss towhom you owe it,—you may be very sure that it will never be encroachedupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”",1503
3469,"In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subjectdone with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for yearsand years to come.",1504
3470,"Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that Ifelt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, asI understood the fact myself.",1504
3471,"It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme forthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much thelighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this tobe the case.",1505
3472,"We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in thecourse of conversation, what he was?",1505
3473,"He replied, “A capitalist,—anInsurer of Ships.” I suppose he saw me glancing about the room insearch of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, “In theCity.”",1505
3474,"I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships inthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insureron his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsiblehead open.",1506
3475,"But again there came upon me, for my relief, that oddimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.",1506
3476,“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital ininsuring ships.,1507
3477,"I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cutinto the Direction.",1507
3478,I shall also do a little in the mining way.,1507
3479,None ofthese things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons onmy own account.,1507
3480,"I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning back in hischair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, andprecious woods.",1507
3481,It’s an interesting trade.”,1507
3482,“And the profits are large?” said I.,1508
3483,“Tremendous!” said he.,1509
3484,"I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations thanmy own.",1510
3486,"“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in hiswaist-coat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.",1512
3487,"Also to Ceylon, especially for elephants’ tusks.”",1512
3488,"“You will want a good many ships,” said I.",1513
3489,"“A perfect fleet,” said he.",1514
3490,"Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I askedhim where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?",1515
3491,"“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied.",1516
3492,“I am looking about me.”,1516
3493,"Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn.",1517
3494,"I said(in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”",1517
3495,“Yes.,1518
3496,"I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”",1518
3497,“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.,1519
3498,"“To—do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked, in reply.",1520
3499,“Yes; to you.”,1521
3500,"“Why, n-no; not to me.” He said this with the air of one carefullyreckoning up and striking a balance.",1522
3501,“Not directly profitable.,1522
3502,"That is,it doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”",1522
3503,"This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head asif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulativecapital from such a source of income.",1523
3504,"“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you.",1524
3505,_That’s_ the grand thing.,1524
3506,"You are in a counting-house, you know, andyou look about you.”",1524
3507,"It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of acounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferredto his experience.",1525
3508,"“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening.",1526
3509,"Andyou go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and thenthere you are!",1526
3510,"When you have once made your capital, you have nothingto do but employ it.”",1526
3511,This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;very like.,1527
3512,"His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly correspondedto his manner of bearing that defeat.",1527
3513,It seemed to me that he took allblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.,1527
3514,"It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplestnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to havebeen sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.",1527
3515,"Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was sounassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not beingpuffed up.",1528
3516,"It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,and we got on famously.",1528
3517,"In the evening we went out for a walk in thestreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went tochurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in theParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joedid.",1528
3518,"On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I hadleft Joe and Biddy.",1529
3519,"The space interposed between myself and thempartook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off.",1529
3520,"ThatI could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, onthe very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination ofimpossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar.",1529
3521,"Yet in theLondon streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in thedusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that Ihad put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead ofnight, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooningabout Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on myheart.",1529
3522,"On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to thecounting-house to report himself,—to look about him, too, Isuppose,—and I bore him company.",1530
3523,"He was to come away in an hour or twoto attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him.",1530
3524,"Itappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatchedwere incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judgingfrom the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Mondaymorning.",1530
3525,"Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in myeyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into anotherback second floor, rather than a look out.",1530
3526,"I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I sawfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took tobe great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all beout of spirits.",1531
3527,"When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at acelebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to havebeen the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not helpnoticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tableclothsand knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks.",1531
3528,"This collationdisposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was notcharged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my littleportmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith.",1531
3529,"We arrived there attwo or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walkto Mr. Pocket’s house.",1531
3530,"Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed directinto a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s childrenwere playing about.",1531
3531,"And unless I deceive myself on a point where myinterests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, butwere tumbling up.",1531
3532,"Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, withher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nurse-maidswere looking about them while the children played.",1532
3533,"“Mamma,” saidHerbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received mewith an appearance of amiable dignity.",1532
3534,"“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of thechildren, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall overinto the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”",1533
3535,"At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, andsaid, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!” Upon whichMrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settlingherself in one chair only, resumed her book.",1534
3536,"Her countenanceimmediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had beenreading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quitewell?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that Ibegan saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any suchperson I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would havebeen very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when thenurse came to my rescue.",1534
3537,"“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don’tmake seven times!",1535
3538,"What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mrs.Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterablesurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh ofrecognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went onreading.",1535
3539,"I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer thansix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up.",1536
3540,"I hadscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in theregion of air, wailing dolefully.",1536
3541,"“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it mostsurprising.",1537
3542,"“Make haste up, Millers.”",1537
3543,"Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and bydegrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were ayoung ventriloquist with something in its mouth.",1538
3544,"Mrs. Pocket read allthe time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.",1538
3545,"We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at anyrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing theremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayednear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up andtumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment, andtheir own more enduring lamentation.",1539
3546,"I was at a loss to account forthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind tospeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, babyand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.",1539
3547,"“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for amoment, “everybody’s tumbling!”",1540
3548,"“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;“what have you got there?”",1541
3549,"“_I_ got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.",1542
3550,"“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson.",1543
3551,"“And if you keep itunder your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling?",1543
3552,Here!,1543
3553,"Take thebaby, Mum, and give me your book.”",1543
3554,"Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant alittle in her lap, while the other children played about it.",1544
3555,"This hadlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary ordersthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.",1544
3556,"Thus I madethe second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of thelittle Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.",1544
3557,"Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got thechildren into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocketcame out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised tofind that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expressionof face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if hedidn’t quite see his way to putting anything straight.",1545
3558,Chapter XXIII.,1547
3559,"Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry tosee him.",1548
3560,"“For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “analarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of hisperplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quitenatural.",1548
3561,"I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it wouldhave been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it wasvery near being so.",1548
3562,"When he had talked with me a little, he said toMrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, whichwere black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled uponme in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste oforange-flower water?",1548
3563,"As the question had no bearing, near or remote, onany foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have beenthrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversationalcondescension.",1548
3564,"I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceasedKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceasedfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determinedopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, ifI ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the LordChancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s,—and had tackedhimself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quitesupposititious fact.",1549
3565,"I believe he had been knighted himself forstorming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperateaddress engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the firststone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personageeither the trowel or the mortar.",1549
3566,"Be that as it may, he had directedMrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the natureof things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from theacquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.",1549
3567,"So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young ladyby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, butperfectly helpless and useless.",1550
3568,"With her character thus happily formed,in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who wasalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether tomount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre.",1550
3569,"As his doingthe one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pockethad taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, itwould seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without theknowledge of the judicious parent.",1550
3570,"The judicious parent, having nothingto bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled thatdower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocketthat his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had investedthe Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it wassupposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest.",1550
3571,"Still, Mrs.Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object ofa queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.",1550
3572,"Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was apleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort formy own private sitting-room.",1551
3573,"He then knocked at the doors of two othersimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummleand Startop.",1551
3574,"Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order ofarchitecture, was whistling.",1551
3575,"Startop, younger in years and appearance,was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger ofexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.",1551
3576,"Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebodyelse’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the houseand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be theservants.",1552
3577,"It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect ofsaving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for theservants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in theireating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs.",1552
3578,"Theyallowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it alwaysappeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boardedin would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable ofself-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring ladywith whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say thatshe had seen Millers slapping the baby.",1552
3579,"This greatly distressed Mrs.Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that itwas an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn’t mind their ownbusiness.",1552
3580,"By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had beeneducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguishedhimself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocketvery early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up thecalling of a Grinder.",1553
3581,"After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whomit was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were alwaysgoing to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when theblades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work andhad come to London.",1553
3582,"Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, hehad “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turnedhis acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, stillmaintained the house I saw.",1553
3583,"Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highlysympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.",1554
3584,"This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking herdown to dinner on the day of my installation.",1554
3585,"She gave me to understandon the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to readwith him.",1554
3586,"That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love andconfidence (at that time, I had known her something less than fiveminutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.",1554
3587,"“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her earlydisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),requires so much luxury and elegance—”",1555
3588,"“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going tocry.",1556
3589,“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”,1557
3590,"“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.",1558
3591,"“—That it _is_ hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s timeand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”",1559
3592,"I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s timeand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my companymanners.",1560
3593,"It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket andDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, andother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christianname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.",1561
3594,"Itfurther appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in thegarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at whichher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come atall.",1561
3595,"Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as asulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.Pocket as a woman and a sister.",1561
3596,"No one but themselves and Mrs. Coilerthe toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of theconversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; butit promised to last a long time, when the page came in with theannouncement of a domestic affliction.",1561
3597,"It was, in effect, that the cookhad mislaid the beef.",1561
3598,"To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the firsttime, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performancethat struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression onanybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest.",1561
3599,"Helaid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at themoment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to makean extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.",1561
3600,"When he had donethis, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on withwhat he was about.",1561
3601,Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me.,1562
3602,"I likedit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that thepleasure was soon over.",1562
3603,"She had a serpentine way of coming close at mewhen she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends andlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; andwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very littleto her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them forbeing on the opposite side of the table.",1562
3604,"After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler madeadmiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way ofimproving their minds.",1563
3605,"There were four little girls, and two littleboys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s nextsuccessor who was as yet neither.",1563
3606,"They were brought in by Flopson andMillers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had beenrecruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if sherather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, butdidn’t quite know what to make of them.",1563
3607,“Here!,1564
3608,"Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson.",1564
3609,"“Don’ttake it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”",1564
3610,"Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head uponthe table; which was announced to all present by a prodigiousconcussion.",1565
3611,"“Dear, dear!",1566
3612,"Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, comeand dance to baby, do!”",1566
3613,"One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurelytaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her placeby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, andlaughed.",1567
3614,"Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in themeantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,and we all laughed and were glad.",1567
3615,"Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nut-crackersto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take noticethat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with itseyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same.",1568
3616,"Then, thetwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircasewith a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearlylost half his buttons at the gaming-table.",1568
3617,"I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into adiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate asliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about thebaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.",1569
3618,"At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed thedangerous weapon away.",1569
3619,"Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about thesame time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—",1569
3620,"“You naughty child, how dare you?",1570
3621,Go and sit down this instant!”,1570
3622,"“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyethout.”",1571
3623,“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket.,1572
3624,“Go and sit down inyour chair this moment!”,1572
3625,"Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as ifI myself had done something to rouse it.",1573
3626,"“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,“how can you be so unreasonable?",1574
3627,Jane only interfered for theprotection of baby.”,1574
3628,"“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket.",1575
3629,"“I amsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront ofinterference.”",1575
3630,"“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.",1576
3631,"“Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody tosave them?”",1576
3632,"“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with amajestic glance at that innocent little offender.",1577
3633,“I hope I know mypoor grandpapa’s position.,1577
3634,"Jane, indeed!”",1577
3635,"Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really didlift himself some inches out of his chair.",1578
3636,“Hear this!” he helplesslyexclaimed to the elements.,1578
3637,"“Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, forpeople’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,and became silent.",1578
3638,We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on.,1579
3639,"Apause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made aseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be theonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it hadany decided acquaintance.",1579
3640,“Mr.,1580
3641,"Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson?",1580
3642,"Jane, youundutiful little thing, go and lie down.",1580
3643,"Now, baby darling, come withma!”",1580
3644,"The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might.",1581
3645,"Itdoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited apair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of itssoft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny.",1581
3646,"And itgained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within afew minutes, being nursed by little Jane.",1581
3647,"It happened that the other five children were left behind at thedinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, andtheir not being anybody else’s business.",1582
3648,"I thus became aware of themutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified inthe following manner.",1582
3649,"Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of hisface heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging inthat establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature onsomebody else.",1582
3650,"Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certainquestions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fannycame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice itwhen she didn’t forget.",1582
3651,"Then, he melted into parental tenderness, andgave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then asthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by thehair he dismissed the hopeless subject.",1582
3652,In the evening there was rowing on the river.,1583
3653,"As Drummle and Startophad each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out.",1583
3654,"Iwas pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, butas I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not tosay for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under thetuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and towhom I was introduced by my new allies.",1583
3655,This practical authorityconfused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith.,1583
3656,"If hecould have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubtif he would have paid it.",1583
3657,"There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think weshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeabledomestic occurrence.",1584
3658,"Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaidcame in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”",1584
3659,"“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was rousedagain.",1585
3660,“How can you think of such a thing?,1585
3661,Go and speak to Flopson.,1585
3662,Orspeak to me—at some other time.”,1585
3663,"“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish tospeak at once, and to speak to master.”",1586
3664,"Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best ofourselves until he came back.",1587
3665,"“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with acountenance expressive of grief and despair.",1588
3666,"“Here’s the cook lyinginsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of freshbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”",1588
3667,"Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This isthat odious Sophia’s doing!”",1589
3668,"“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.",1590
3669,"“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket.",1591
3670,"“Did I not see her with my owneyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and askto speak to you?”",1591
3671,"“But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket,“and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”",1592
3672,"“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for makingmischief?”",1593
3673,Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.,1594
3674,"“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” saidMrs. Pocket.",1595
3675,"“Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectfulwoman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look afterthe situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”",1595
3676,"There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in theattitude of the Dying Gladiator.",1596
3677,"Still in that attitude he said, with ahollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to goto bed and leave him.",1596
3678,Chapter XXIV.,1598
3679,"After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room andhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and hadordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talktogether.",1599
3680,"He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for hereferred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designedfor any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for mydestiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men inprosperous circumstances.",1599
3681,"I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing tothe contrary.",1599
3682,"He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisitionof such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with thefunctions of explainer and director of all my studies.",1600
3683,"He hoped thatwith intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his.",1600
3684,"Through hisway of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himselfon confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may stateat once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling hiscompact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfillingmine with him.",1600
3685,"If he had shown indifference as a master, I have nodoubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me nosuch excuse, and each of us did the other justice.",1600
3686,"Nor did I everregard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but whatwas serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.",1600
3687,"When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I hadbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain mybedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while mymanners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society.",1601
3688,"Mr. Pocket didnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step couldpossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian.",1601
3689,"I feltthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan wouldsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and impartedmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.",1601
3690,"“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one ortwo other little things, I should be quite at home there.”",1602

3692,“I told you you’d geton.,1603
3693,Well!,1603

3721,"Mr. Jaggers neverlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poisinghimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrowsjoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots tocreak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way.",1620
3722,"As he happenedto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said toWemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’s manner.",1620
3723,"“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick;“he don’t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!” for Ilooked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: onlyprofessional.”",1621
3724,"Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, asif he were posting them.",1622
3725,"“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap andwas watching it.",1623
3726,Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”,1623
3727,"Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,I said I supposed he was very skilful?",1624
3728,"“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at theoffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for thepurposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of theglobe.",1625
3729,"“If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pento paper, “he’d be it.”",1625
3730,"Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,“Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks?",1626
3731,"to which hereplied,—",1626
3732,"“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, andpeople won’t have him at second hand.",1627
3733,There are only four of us.,1627
3734,Wouldyou like to see ’em?,1627
3735,"You are one of us, as I may say.”",1627
3736,I accepted the offer.,1628
3737,"When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into thepost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key ofwhich safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from hiscoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs.",1628
3738,"The house was darkand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.Jaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircasefor years.",1628
3739,"In the front first floor, a clerk who looked somethingbetween a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollenman—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabbyappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed tobe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers.",1628
3740,"“Getting evidencetogether,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In theroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) wassimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presentedto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would meltme anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,as if he had been trying his art on himself.",1628
3741,"In a back room, ahigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who wasdressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having beenwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes ofthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.",1628
3742,This was all the establishment.,1629
3743,"When we went downstairs again, Wemmickled me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”",1629
3744,"“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon themcaught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”",1630
3745,"“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust offthe horrible heads before bringing them down.",1631
3746,“These are two celebratedones.,1631
3747,Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit.,1631
3748,"This chap(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into theinkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!)",1631
3749,"murderedhis master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence,didn’t plan it badly.”",1631
3750,"“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spatupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.",1632
3751,“Like him?,1633
3752,"It’s himself, you know.",1633
3753,"The cast was made in Newgate,directly after he was taken down.",1633
3754,"You had a particular fancy for me,hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick.",1633
3755,"He then explained thisaffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the ladyand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,“Had it made for me, express!”",1633
3756,“Is the lady anybody?” said I.,1634
3757,"“No,” returned Wemmick.",1635
3758,“Only his game.,1635
3759,"(You liked your bit of game,didn’t you?)",1635
3760,"No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, exceptone,—and she wasn’t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn’thave caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something todrink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, heput down the cast, and polished the brooch with hispocket-handkerchief.",1635
3761,“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked.,1636
3762,“He has thesame look.”,1636
3763,"“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look.",1637
3764,Much as if onenostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook.,1637
3765,"Yes, hecame to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.",1637
3766,"Heforged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposedtestators to sleep too.",1637
3767,"You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr.Wemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write Greek.",1637
3768,"Yah, Bounceable!",1637
3769,What a liar you were!,1637
3770,"I never met such a liar as you!”Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched thelargest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me,only the day before.”",1637
3771,"While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derivedfrom like sources.",1638
3772,"As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, Iventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stoodbefore me, dusting his hands.",1638
3773,"“O yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind.",1639
3774,"One bringsanother, you see; that’s the way of it.",1639
3775,I always take ’em.,1639
3776,They’recuriosities.,1639
3777,And they’re property.,1639
3778,"They may not be worth much, but,after all, they’re property and portable.",1639
3779,"It don’t signify to you withyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,‘Get hold of portable property’.”",1639
3780,"When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in afriendly manner:—",1640
3781,"“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’tmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and Ishould consider it an honour.",1641
3782,I have not much to show you; but such twoor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and Iam fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”,1641
3783,I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.,1642
3784,"“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, whenconvenient to you.",1643
3785,Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”,1643
3786,“Not yet.”,1644
3787,"“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine.",1645
3788,"I’ll giveyou punch, and not bad punch.",1645
3789,And now I’ll tell you something.,1645
3790,"When yougo to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”",1645
3791,“Shall I see something very uncommon?”,1646
3792,"“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed.",1647
3793,"Not so veryuncommon, you’ll tell me.",1647
3794,"I reply, that depends on the originalwildness of the beast, and the amount of taming.",1647
3795,It won’t lower youropinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers.,1647
3796,Keep your eye on it.”,1647
3797,"I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that hispreparation awakened.",1648
3798,"As I was taking my departure, he asked me if Iwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”",1648
3799,"For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know whatMr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative.",1649
3800,"Wedived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where ablood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with thefanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortablychewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination orcross-examination,—I don’t know which,—and was striking her, and thebench, and everybody present, with awe.",1649
3801,"If anybody, of whatsoeverdegree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required tohave it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite ofhis finger.",1649
3802,"Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on hiswords, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in theirdirection.",1649
3803,"Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed tome to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when Istole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he wasmaking the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsiveunder the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as therepresentative of British law and justice in that chair that day.",1649
3804,Chapter XXV.,1651
3805,"Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a bookas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up anacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit.",1652
3806,"Heavy in figure, movement, andcomprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in thelarge, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as hehimself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,reserved, and suspicious.",1652
3807,"He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made thediscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead.",1652
3808,"Thus, BentleyDrummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than thatgentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.",1652
3809,"Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he oughtto have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, andadmired her beyond measure.",1653
3810,"He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, andwas—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert tome—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take tohim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliestevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of oneanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up inour wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes.",1653
3811,"Hewould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibiouscreature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; andI always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by theback-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or themoonlight in mid-stream.",1653
3812,Herbert was my intimate companion and friend.,1654
3813,"I presented him with ahalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming downto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers oftentook me up to London.",1654
3814,We used to walk between the two places at allhours.,1654
3815,"I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not sopleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility ofuntried youth and hope.",1654
3816,"When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.Camilla turned up.",1655
3817,Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister.,1655
3818,"Georgiana, whom Ihad seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up.",1655
3819,"Shewas a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidityreligion, and her liver love.",1655
3820,These people hated me with the hatred ofcupidity and disappointment.,1655
3821,"As a matter of course, they fawned upon mein my prosperity with the basest meanness.",1655
3822,"Towards Mr. Pocket, as agrown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed thecomplacent forbearance I had heard them express.",1655
3823,"Mrs. Pocket they heldin contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavilydisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light uponthemselves.",1655
3824,"These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and appliedmyself to my education.",1656
3825,"I soon contracted expensive habits, and beganto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I shouldhave thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to mybooks.",1656
3826,"There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough tofeel my deficiencies.",1656
3827,"Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start Iwanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been asgreat a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.",1656
3828,"I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would writehim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening.",1657
3829,"Hereplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expectme at the office at six o’clock.",1657
3830,"Thither I went, and there I found him,putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.",1657
3831,“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.,1658
3832,"“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”",1659
3833,"“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under thedesk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them.",1660
3834,"Now, I’ll tell youwhat I have got for supper, Mr. Pip.",1660
3835,"I have got a stewed steak,—whichis of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from thecook’s-shop.",1660
3836,"I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was aJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.",1660
3837,"I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out agood one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the boxanother day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,“Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, ofcourse.",1660
3838,"As far as it goes, it’s property and portable.",1660
3839,"You don’t objectto an aged parent, I hope?”",1660
3840,"I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said whatpoliteness required.",1661
3841,"“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walkedalong.",1662
3842,“Not yet.”,1663
3843,“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming.,1664
3844,I expectyou’ll have an invitation to-morrow.,1664
3845,"He’s going to ask your pals, too.",1664
3846,Three of ’em; ain’t there?”,1664
3847,"Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of myintimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”",1665
3848,"“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented bythe word,—“and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good.",1666
3849,"Don’t lookforward to variety, but you’ll have excellence.",1666
3850,"And there’s another rumthing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as ifthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets adoor or window be fastened at night.”",1666
3851,“Is he never robbed?”,1667
3852,“That’s it!” returned Wemmick.,1668
3853,"“He says, and gives it out publicly, “Iwant to see the man who’ll rob _me_.” Lord bless you, I have heard him,a hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen inour front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawnthere; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me?",1668
3854,"Come; can’t Itempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,for love or money.”",1668
3855,“They dread him so much?” said I.,1669
3856,"“Dread him,” said Wemmick.",1670
3857,“I believe you they dread him.,1670

3859,"No silver, sir.",1670
3860,"Britanniametal, every spoon.”",1670
3861,"“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”",1671
3862,“Ah!,1672
3863,"But _he_ would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “andthey know it.",1672
3864,"He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.",1672
3865,He’d have all he could get.,1672
3866,"And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’tget, if he gave his mind to it.”",1672
3867,"I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmickremarked:—",1673
3868,"“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know.",1674
3869,"Ariver’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth.",1674
3870,Look at hiswatch-chain.,1674
3871,That’s real enough.”,1674
3872,"“It’s very massive,” said I.",1675
3873,“Massive?” repeated Wemmick.,1676
3874,“I think so.,1676
3875,"And his watch is a goldrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny.",1676
3876,"Mr. Pip,there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all aboutthat watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, whowouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if itwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”",1676
3877,"At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of amore general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and theroad, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in thedistrict of Walworth.",1677
3878,"It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and littlegardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.",1678
3879,"Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots ofgarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a batterymounted with guns.",1678
3880,"“My own doing,” said Wemmick.",1679
3881,“Looks pretty; don’t it?”,1679
3882,"I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of themsham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.",1680
3883,"“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I runup a real flag.",1681
3884,Then look here.,1681
3885,"After I have crossed this bridge, Ihoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”",1681
3886,"The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide andtwo deep.",1682
3887,"But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which hehoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish andnot merely mechanically.",1682
3888,"“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gunfires.",1683
3889,"There he is, you see!",1683
3890,"And when you hear him go, I think you’llsay he’s a Stinger.”",1683
3891,"The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,constructed of lattice-work.",1684
3892,It was protected from the weather by aningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.,1684
3893,"“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impedethe idea of fortifications,—for it’s a principle with me, if you havean idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I don’t know whether that’s youropinion—”",1685
3894,"I said, decidedly.",1686
3895,"“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, Iknock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; andyou’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise.",1687
3896,"So, sir,” saidWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “ifyou can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil ofa time in point of provisions.”",1687
3897,"Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which wasapproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a longtime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.",1688
3898,"Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bowerwas raised.",1688
3899,"This piece of water (with an island in the middle whichmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and hehad constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little millgoing and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extentthat it made the back of your hand quite wet.",1688
3900,"“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and myown gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, inacknowledging my compliments.",1689
3901,"“Well; it’s a good thing, you know.",1689
3902,"Itbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged.",1689
3903,"You wouldn’tmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you?",1689
3904,It wouldn’t putyou out?”,1689
3905,"I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle.",1690
3906,"There wefound, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.",1690
3907,"“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordialand jocose way, “how am you?”",1691
3908,"“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.",1692
3909,"“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hearhis name.",1693
3910,"Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes.",1693
3911,"Nod away athim, if you please, like winking!”",1693
3912,"“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while Inodded as hard as I possibly could.",1694
3913,"“This is a pretty pleasure-ground,sir.",1694
3914,"This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kepttogether by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’senjoyment.”",1694
3915,"“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;“_there’s_ a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “_there’s_another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you likethat, don’t you?",1695
3916,"If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiringto strangers—will you tip him one more?",1695
3917,You can’t think how it pleaseshim.”,1695
3918,"I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits.",1696
3919,"We left himbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch inthe arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it hadtaken him a good many years to bring the property up to its presentpitch of perfection.",1696
3920,"“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”",1697
3921,"“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time.",1698
3922,"It’s afreehold, by George!”",1698
3923,“Is it indeed?,1699
3924,I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”,1699
3925,"“Never seen it,” said Wemmick.",1700
3926,“Never heard of it.,1700
3927,Never seen the Aged.,1700
3928,Never heard of him.,1700

3931,"If it’s notin any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same.",1700
3932,Idon’t wish it professionally spoken about.”,1700
3933,Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of hisrequest.,1701
3934,"The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it andtalking, until it was almost nine o’clock.",1701
3935,"“Getting near gun-fire,”said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”",1701
3936,"Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this greatnightly ceremony.",1702
3937,"Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until themoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, andrepair to the battery.",1702
3938,"He took it, and went out, and presently theStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of acottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacupin it ring.",1702
3939,"Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown outof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,“He’s fired!",1702
3940,I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until itis no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.,1702
3941,The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing mehis collection of curiosities.,1703
3942,"They were mostly of a feloniouscharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had beencommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, andseveral manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon whichMr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “everyone of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among smallspecimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by theproprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.",1703
3943,"They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I hadbeen first inducted, and which served, not only as the generalsitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepanon the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for thesuspension of a roasting-jack.",1703
3944,"There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Agedin the day.",1704
3945,"When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was loweredto give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night.",1704
3946,"The supperwas excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rotinsomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might havebeen farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.",1704
3947,"Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond therebeing such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that whenI lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance thatpole on my forehead all night.",1704
3948,"Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard himcleaning my boots.",1705
3949,"After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him frommy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in amost devoted manner.",1705
3950,"Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and athalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain.",1705
3951,"By degrees,Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightenedinto a post-office again.",1705
3952,"At last, when we got to his place of businessand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked asunconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and thedrawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of theStinger.",1705
3953,Chapter XXVI.,1707
3954,"It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an earlyopportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of hiscashier and clerk.",1708
3955,"My guardian was in his room, washing his hands withhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and hecalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friendswhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive.",1708
3956,"“No ceremony,” he stipulated,“and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we shouldcome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in hisgeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,“Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunityof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon ora dentist.",1708
3957,"He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop.",1708
3958,"It had anunusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he wouldwash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from hisroom.",1708
3959,"When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, heseemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion thanusual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not onlywashing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat.",1708
3960,"Andeven when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails beforehe put his coat on.",1708
3961,"There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out intothe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there wassomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled hispresence, that they gave it up for that day.",1709
3962,"As we walked alongwestward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd ofthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but henever otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybodyrecognised him.",1709
3963,"He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south sideof that street.",1710
3964,"Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully inwant of painting, and with dirty windows.",1710
3965,"He took out his key andopened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, andlittle used.",1710
3966,"So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three darkbrown rooms on the first floor.",1710
3967,"There were carved garlands on thepanelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I knowwhat kind of loops I thought they looked like.",1710
3968,"Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was hisdressing-room; the third, his bedroom.",1711
3969,"He told us that he held thewhole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw.",1711
3970,"The table wascomfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side ofhis chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles anddecanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert.",1711
3971,"I noticedthroughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributedeverything himself.",1711
3972,"There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,trials, acts of Parliament, and such things.",1712
3973,"The furniture was all verysolid and good, like his watch-chain.",1712
3974,"It had an official look, however,and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen.",1712
3975,"In a corner was alittle table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bringthe office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of anevening and fall to work.",1712
3976,"As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I hadwalked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,and took a searching look at them.",1713
3977,"To my surprise, he seemed at once tobe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.",1713
3978,"“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me tothe window, “I don’t know one from the other.",1714
3979,Who’s the Spider?”,1714
3980,“The spider?” said I.,1715
3981,"“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”",1716
3982,"“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face isStartop.”",1717
3983,"Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” hereturned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it?",1718
3984,I like the look of thatfellow.”,1718
3985,"He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by hisreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it toscrew discourse out of him.",1719
3986,"I was looking at the two, when there camebetween me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.",1719
3987,"She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought heryounger than she was.",1720
3988,"Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremelypale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair.",1720
3989,"I cannotsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to beparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curiousexpression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to seeMacbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face lookedto me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I hadseen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.",1720
3990,"She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with afinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished.",1721
3991,"We took our seatsat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,while Startop sat on the other.",1721
3992,"It was a noble dish of fish that thehousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choicemutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird.",1721
3993,"Sauces, wines, allthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by ourhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of thetable, he always put them back again.",1721
3994,"Similarly, he dealt us cleanplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those justdisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair.",1721
3995,No other attendantthan the housekeeper appeared.,1721
3996,"She set on every dish; and I always sawin her face, a face rising out of the caldron.",1721
3997,"Years afterwards, I madea dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no othernatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to passbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.",1721
3998,"Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her ownstriking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed thatwhenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on myguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she putbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, andwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say.",1722
3999,"Ifancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, anda purpose of always holding her in suspense.",1722
4000,"Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow ratherthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part ofour dispositions out of us.",1723
4001,"For myself, I found that I was expressingmy tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and toboast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened mylips.",1723
4002,"It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: thedevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspiciousway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.",1723
4003,"It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that ourconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was ralliedfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.",1724
4004,"Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room toour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and thatas to strength he could scatter us like chaff.",1724
4005,"By some invisibleagency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocityabout this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to showhow muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms ina ridiculous manner.",1724
4006,"Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger andshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.",1725
4007,"Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,as she stretched it across the table.",1725
4008,"So suddenly and smartly did he dothis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.",1725
4009,"“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “_I_’ll show you a wrist.",1726
4010,"Molly, let them see your wrist.”",1726
4011,"Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her otherhand behind her waist.",1727
4012,"“Master,” she said, in a low voice, with hereyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him.",1727
4013,“Don’t.”,1727
4014,"“_I_’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovabledetermination to show it.",1728
4015,"“Molly, let them see your wrist.”",1728
4016,"“Master,” she again murmured.",1729
4017,“Please!”,1729
4018,"“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately lookingat the opposite side of the room, “let them see _both_ your wrists.",1730
4019,Show them.,1730
4020,Come!”,1730
4021,"He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table.",1731
4022,"Shebrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side byside.",1731
4023,"The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarredacross and across.",1731
4024,"When she held her hands out she took her eyes fromMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of usin succession.",1731
4025,"“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinewswith his forefinger.",1732
4026,“Very few men have the power of wrist that thiswoman has.,1732
4027,It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in thesehands.,1732
4028,"I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never sawstronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”",1732
4029,"While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continuedto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat.",1733
4030,"The momenthe ceased, she looked at him again.",1733
4031,"“That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass andpassed round the wine.",1733
4032,"“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up.",1734
4033,Pray makethe best use of your time.,1734
4034,I am glad to see you all.,1734
4035,"Mr. Drummle, Idrink to you.”",1734
4036,"If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,it perfectly succeeded.",1735
4037,"In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morosedepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,until he became downright intolerable.",1735
4038,"Through all his stages, Mr.Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest.",1735
4039,He actually seemedto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.,1735
4040,"In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,and I know we talked too much.",1736
4041,"We became particularly hot upon someboorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free withour money.",1736
4042,"It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, thatit came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in mypresence but a week or so before.",1736
4043,"“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”",1737
4044,"“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make youhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”",1738
4045,“_You_ should think!” retorted Drummle.,1739
4046,“Oh Lord!”,1739
4047,"“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’tlend money to any of us if we wanted it.”",1740
4048,"“You are right,” said Drummle.",1741
4049,“I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.,1741
4050,I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”,1741
4051,"“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”",1742
4052,"“_You_ should say,” repeated Drummle.",1743
4053,“Oh Lord!”,1743
4054,"This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myselfmaking no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregardingHerbert’s efforts to check me,—",1744
4055,"“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you whatpassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”",1745
4056,"“_I_ don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,”growled Drummle.",1746
4057,"And I think he added in a lower growl, that we mightboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.",1746
4058,"“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not.",1747
4059,"Wesaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemedto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”",1747
4060,"Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his handsin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying thatit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.",1748
4061,"Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace thanI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable.",1749
4062,"Startop,being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exactopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a directpersonal affront.",1749
4063,"He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startoptried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that madeus all laugh.",1749
4064,"Resenting this little success more than anything,Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of hispockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, andwould have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’sdexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for thatpurpose.",1749
4065,"“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, andhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedinglysorry to announce that it’s half past nine.”",1750
4066,On this hint we all rose to depart.,1751
4067,"Before we got to the street door,Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing hadhappened.",1751
4068,"But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would noteven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of thehouses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.",1751
4069,"As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there fora moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian.",1752
4070,"I foundhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hardat it, washing his hands of us.",1752
4071,"I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anythingdisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blameme much.",1753
4072,"“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through thewater-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip.",1754
4073,I like that Spider though.”,1754
4074,"He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,and towelling himself.",1755
4075,"“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I—“but I don’t.”",1756
4076,"“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do with him.",1757
4077,Keep as clear of him as you can.,1757
4078,"But I like the fellow, Pip; he is oneof the true sort.",1757
4079,"Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”",1757
4080,"Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.",1758
4081,"“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into afestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears.",1759
4082,"“You know what Iam, don’t you?",1759
4083,"Good night, Pip.”",1759
4084,"“Good night, sir.”",1760
4085,"In about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was upfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, hewent home to the family hole.",1761

4140,"“I _were_,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.",1787
4141,“Was there a great sensation?”,1788
4142,"“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.",1789
4143,Partickler when he see the ghost.,1789
4144,"Though I put it to yourself, sir,whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a goodhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with“Amen!” A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” saidJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but thatis no reason why you should put him out at such a time.",1789
4145,"Which Imeantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed toclaim his attention, what can, Sir?",1789
4146,"Still more, when his mourning ’atis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathersbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”",1789
4147,A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herberthad entered the room.,1790
4148,"So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out hishand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.",1790
4149,"“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here hiseye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and soplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of thefamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, youtwo gentlemen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?",1791
4150,"For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,”said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; butI wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished himto fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”",1791
4151,"Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of ourdwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me“sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round theroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,—as if it wereonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find aresting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of thechimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.",1792
4152,"“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who alwayspresided of a morning.",1793
4153,"“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whicheveris most agreeable to yourself.”",1794
4154,“What do you say to coffee?”,1795
4155,"“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,“since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not runcontrairy to your own opinions.",1796
4156,But don’t you never find it a little’eating?”,1796
4157,"“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.",1797
4158,"Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of hischair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot.",1798
4159,As if itwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off againsoon.,1798
4160,"“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”",1799
4161,"“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind hishand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.",1800
4162,“No it were not.,1800
4163,Yes it were.,1800
4164,Yes.,1800
4165,"It were yesterday afternoon” (withan appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).",1800
4166,“Have you seen anything of London yet?”,1801
4167,"“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look atthe Blacking Ware’us.",1802
4168,"But we didn’t find that it come up to itslikeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” addedJoe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd tooarchitectooralooral.”",1802
4169,"I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightilyexpressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfectChorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by hishat, which was toppling.",1803
4170,"Indeed, it demanded from him a constantattention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted bywicket-keeping.",1803
4171,"He made extraordinary play with it, and showed thegreatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as itdropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouringit in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the patternof the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty oflaying hands upon it.",1803
4173,"As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing toreflect upon,—insoluble mysteries both.",1805
4174,"Why should a man scrape himselfto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed?",1805
4175,Whyshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for hisholiday clothes?,1805
4176,"Then he fell into such unaccountable fits ofmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; hadhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with suchremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much morethan he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I washeartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.",1805
4177,"I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this wasall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would havebeen easier with me.",1806
4178,I felt impatient of him and out of temper withhim; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.,1806
4179,"“Us two being now alone, sir,”—began Joe.",1807
4180,"“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, sir?”",1808
4181,Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly likereproach.,1809
4182,"Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collarswere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.",1809
4183,"“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentionsand abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will nowconclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had thepresent honour.",1810
4184,"For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of lucidexposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should nothave had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode ofgentlemen.”",1810
4185,"I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstranceagainst this tone.",1811
4186,"“Well, sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were.",1812
4187,"I were at the Bargement’other night, Pip;”—whenever he subsided into affection, he called mePip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; “whenthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook.",1812
4188,"Which that sameidentical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my ’air thewrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it werehim which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as aplayfellow by yourself.”",1812
4189,“Nonsense.,1813
4190,"It was you, Joe.”",1813
4191,"“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing hishead, “though it signify little now, sir.",1814
4192,"Well, Pip; this sameidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at theBargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to theworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’”",1814
4193,"“Miss Havisham, Joe?”",1815
4194,"“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat androlled his eyes at the ceiling.",1816
4195,"“Yes, Joe?",1817
4196,"Go on, please.”",1817
4197,"“Next day, sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,“having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”",1818
4198,"“Miss A., Joe?",1819
4199,Miss Havisham?”,1819
4200,"“Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as ifhe were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham.",1820
4201,Herexpression air then as follering: ‘Mr.,1820
4202,Gargery.,1820
4203,"You air incorrespondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a letter from you, I were ableto say ‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, sir, I said ‘I will;’ andwhen I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him,then,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad tosee him.’”",1820
4204,I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe.,1821
4205,"I hope one remote cause ofits firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known hiserrand, I should have given him more encouragement.",1821
4206,"“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write themessage to you, a little hung back.",1822
4207,"Biddy says, ‘I know he will be veryglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to seehim, go!’ I have now concluded, sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair,“and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and agreater height.”",1822
4208,"“But you are not going now, Joe?”",1823
4209,"“Yes I am,” said Joe.",1824
4210,"“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”",1825
4211,"“No I am not,” said Joe.",1826
4212,"Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as hegave me his hand.",1827
4213,"“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings weldedtogether, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s awhitesmith, and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith.",1828

4221,"You won’t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as youshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forgewindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the oldburnt apron, sticking to the old work.",1828
4222,"I’m awful dull, but I hope I’vebeat out something nigh the rights of this at last.",1828
4223,"And so GOD blessyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”",1828
4224,I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity inhim.,1829
4225,The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when hespoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven.,1829
4226,"He touchedme gently on the forehead, and went out.",1829

4228,Chapter XXVIII.,1831
4229,"It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the firstflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.",1832
4230,"But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow’s coach, and had beendown to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on thelast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting upat the Blue Boar.",1832
4231,"I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was notexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from MissHavisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it.",1832
4232,"All otherswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with suchpretences did I cheat myself.",1832
4233,Surely a curious thing.,1832
4234,That I shouldinnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture isreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coinof my own make as good money!,1832
4235,"An obliging stranger, under pretence ofcompactly folding up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts thenotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!",1832
4236,"Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was muchdisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger.",1833
4237,"It wastempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his bootsin the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn toimagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding thedisrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy.",1833
4238,"On the other hand, Trabb’s boymight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, recklessand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the HighStreet.",1833
4239,"My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve.",1833
4240,"On thewhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.",1833
4241,"It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, aswinter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination untiltwo or three hours after dark.",1834
4242,Our time of starting from the Cross Keyswas two o’clock.,1834
4243,"I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour tospare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression withone who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.",1834
4244,At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yardsby stage-coach.,1835
4245,"As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outsidepassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road danglingtheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprisedwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there weretwo convicts going down with me.",1835
4246,But I had a reason that was an oldreason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word“convict.”,1835
4247,"“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert.",1836
4248,“O no!”,1837

4251,But I don’t mind them.”,1839
4252,“See!,1840
4253,"There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap.",1840
4254,What adegraded and vile sight it is!”,1840
4255,"They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaolerwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.",1841
4256,"The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on theirlegs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well.",1841
4257,They wore the dress that Ilikewise knew well.,1841
4258,"Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried athick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of goodunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on atthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convictswere an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and hethe Curator.",1841
4259,"One was a taller and stouter man than the other, andappeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of theworld, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smallersuit of clothes.",1841
4260,"His arms and legs were like great pincushions of thoseshapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew hishalf-closed eye at one glance.",1841
4261,"There stood the man whom I had seen onthe settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who hadbrought me down with his invisible gun!",1841
4262,It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he hadnever seen me in his life.,1842
4263,"He looked across at me, and his eyeappraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and saidsomething to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselvesround with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at somethingelse.",1842
4264,"The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were loweranimals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded withpocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at themand kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeableand degraded spectacle.",1842
4265,But this was not the worst of it.,1843
4266,"It came out that the whole of theback of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, andthat there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat infront behind the coachman.",1843
4267,"Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who hadtaken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with suchvillainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, andinfamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else.",1843
4268,"At this time thecoach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparingto get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringingwith them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, andhearthstone, which attends the convict presence.",1843
4269,"“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angrypassenger; “I’ll sit next you myself.",1844
4270,I’ll put ’em on the outside ofthe row.,1844
4271,"They won’t interfere with you, sir.",1844
4272,You needn’t know they’rethere.”,1844
4273,"“And don’t blame _me_,” growled the convict I had recognised.",1845
4274,“_I_don’t want to go.,1845
4275,_I_ am quite ready to stay behind.,1845
4276,As fur as I amconcerned any one’s welcome to _my_ place.”,1845
4277,"“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly.",1846
4278,"“_I_ wouldn’t have incommoded noneof you, if I’d had _my_ way.” Then they both laughed, and begancracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think Ishould have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and sodespised.",1846
4279,"At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind.",1847
4280,"Sohe got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got intothe place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well asthey could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with hisbreath on the hair of my head.",1847
4281,"“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started.",1848
4282,"I thought what ablessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.",1848
4283,"It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’sbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine.",1849
4284,"Thesensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent andsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge.",1849
4285,"He seemed to have morebreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise indoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.",1849
4286,"The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold.",1850
4287,"It made usall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-wayHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent.",1850
4288,"I dozedoff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore acouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,and how it could best be done.",1850
4289,"In the act of dipping forward as if Iwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took thequestion up again.",1850
4290,"But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although Icould recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights andshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind thatblew at us.",1851
4291,"Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen againstthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before.",1851
4292,"The very firstwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words ofmy own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”",1851
4293,“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.,1852
4294,“How should I know?” returned the other.,1853
4295,“He had ’em stowed awaysomehows.,1853

4345,"It was too early yet to go toMiss Havisham’s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham’s sideof town,—which was not Joe’s side; I could go there to-morrow,—thinkingabout my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her plans forme.",1874
4346,"She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it couldnot fail to be her intention to bring us together.",1875
4347,"She reserved it forme to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the darkrooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear downthe cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds ofthe young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.",1875
4348,"I had stopped tolook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blockedwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys withits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a richattractive mystery, of which I was the hero.",1875
4349,"Estella was theinspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course.",1875
4350,"But, though she hadtaken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were soset upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character hadbeen all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest herwith any attributes save those she possessed.",1875
4351,"I mention this in thisplace, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to befollowed into my poor labyrinth.",1875
4352,"According to my experience, theconventional notion of a lover cannot be always true.",1875
4353,"The unqualifiedtruth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved hersimply because I found her irresistible.",1875
4354,"Once for all; I knew to mysorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her againstreason, against promise, against peace, against hope, againsthappiness, against all discouragement that could be.",1875
4355,"Once for all; Iloved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influencein restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be humanperfection.",1875
4356,I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time.,1876
4357,"When Ihad rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon thegate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heartmoderately quiet.",1876
4358,"I heard the side-door open, and steps come across thecourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on itsrusty hinges.",1876
4359,"Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned.",1877
4360,"I startedmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sobergrey dress.",1877
4361,The last man I should have expected to see in that place ofporter at Miss Havisham’s door.,1877
4362,“Orlick!”,1878
4363,"“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours.",1879
4364,"But come in, comein.",1879
4365,It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”,1879
4366,"I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out.",1880
4367,"“Yes!”said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towardsthe house.",1880
4368,“Here I am!”,1880
4369,“How did you come here?”,1881
4370,"“I come here,” he retorted, “on my legs.",1882
4371,I had my box brought alongsideme in a barrow.”,1882
4372,“Are you here for good?”,1883
4373,"“I ain’t here for harm, young master, I suppose?”",1884
4374,I was not so sure of that.,1885
4375,"I had leisure to entertain the retort in mymind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up mylegs and arms, to my face.",1885
4376,“Then you have left the forge?” I said.,1886
4377,"“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance allround him with an air of injury.",1887
4378,"“Now, do it look like it?”",1887
4379,I asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?,1888
4380,"“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t knowwithout casting it up.",1889
4381,"However, I come here some time since you left.”",1889
4382,"“I could have told you that, Orlick.”",1890
4383,"“Ah!” said he, dryly.",1891
4384,“But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”,1891
4385,"By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be onejust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on thecourtyard.",1892
4386,"In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind ofplace usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris.",1892
4387,"Certain keys werehanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and hispatchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess.",1892
4388,"Thewhole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for ahuman dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of acorner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it wasfitted up,—as indeed he was.",1892
4389,"“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be noPorter here.”",1893
4390,"“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection onthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts andTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down.",1894
4391,"And then I was recommendedto the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,and I took it.",1894
4392,"It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’sloaded, that is.”",1894
4393,"My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over thechimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.",1895
4394,"“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up toMiss Havisham?”",1896
4395,"“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and thenshaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master.",1897
4396,"I give this herebell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage tillyou meet somebody.”",1897
4397,"“I am expected, I believe?”",1898
4398,"“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.",1899
4399,"Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden inmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound.",1900
4400,"At the end of the passage,while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, whoappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reasonof me.",1900
4401,“Oh!” said she.,1901
4402,"“You, is it, Mr. Pip?”",1901
4403,"“It is, Miss Pocket.",1902
4404,I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and familyare all well.”,1902
4405,"“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;“they had better be wiser, than well.",1903
4406,"Ah, Matthew, Matthew!",1903
4407,"You knowyour way, sir?”",1903
4408,"Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time.",1904
4409,"Iascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my oldway at the door of Miss Havisham’s room.",1904
4410,"“Pip’s rap,” I heard her say,immediately; “come in, Pip.”",1904
4411,"She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her twohands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes onthe fire.",1905
4412,"Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never beenworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was anelegant lady whom I had never seen.",1905
4413,"“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without lookinground or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip?",1906
4414,"so you kiss my hand asif I were a queen, eh?—Well?”",1906
4415,"She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in agrimly playful manner,—",1907
4416,“Well?”,1908
4417,"“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were sokind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”",1909
4418,“Well?”,1910
4419,"The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and lookedarchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes.",1911
4420,"But shewas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, thatI seemed to have made none.",1911
4421,"I fancied, as I looked at her, that Islipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again.",1911
4422,"O thesense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and theinaccessibility that came about her!",1911
4423,She gave me her hand.,1912
4424,"I stammered something about the pleasure I feltin seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for along, long time.",1912
4425,"“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with hergreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood betweenthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.",1913
4426,"“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estellain the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously intothe old—”",1914
4427,“What?,1915
4428,You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havishaminterrupted.,1915
4429,"“She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go awayfrom her.",1915
4430,Don’t you remember?”,1915
4431,"I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no betterthen, and the like.",1916
4432,"Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said shehad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been verydisagreeable.",1916
4433,“Is _he_ changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.,1917
4434,"“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.",1918
4435,"“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’shair.",1919
4436,"Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,and looked at me, and put the shoe down.",1920
4437,"She treated me as a boy still,but she lured me on.",1920
4438,"We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had sowrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home fromFrance, and that she was going to London.",1921
4439,"Proud and wilful as of old,she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty thatit was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate themfrom her beauty.",1921
4440,"Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presencefrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that haddisturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that hadfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that hadraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on theanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the woodenwindow of the forge, and flit away.",1921
4441,"In a word, it was impossible for meto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost lifeof my life.",1921
4442,"It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, andreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow.",1922
4443,"When we hadconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in theneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheelher about a little, as in times of yore.",1922
4444,"So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which Ihad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine.",1923
4445,"Aswe drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—",1923
4446,"“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fightthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”",1924
4447,“You rewarded me very much.”,1925
4448,"“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way.",1926
4449,"“I remember Ientertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it illthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”",1926
4450,“He and I are great friends now.”,1927
4451,“Are you?,1928
4452,"I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”",1928
4453,“Yes.”,1929
4454,"I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyishlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.",1930
4455,"“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed yourcompanions,” said Estella.",1931
4456,"“Naturally,” said I.",1932
4457,"“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit companyfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”",1933
4458,"In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingeringintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation putit to flight.",1934
4459,"“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” saidEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fightingtimes.",1935
4460,“Not the least.”,1936
4461,"The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at myside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked athers, made a contrast that I strongly felt.",1937
4462,"It would have rankled in memore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by beingso set apart for her and assigned to her.",1937
4463,"The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, andafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out againinto the brewery yard.",1938
4464,"I showed her to a nicety where I had seen herwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold andcareless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she hadcome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “Idon’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I.",1938
4465,"“No,”said she, and shook her head and looked about her.",1938
4466,"I verily believethat her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cryagain, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.",1938
4467,"“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant andbeautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything todo with my memory.”",1939
4468,I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty ofdoubting that.,1940
4469,That I knew better.,1940
4470,That there could be no such beautywithout it.,1940
4471,“Oh!,1941
4472,"I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” saidEstella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be.",1941
4473,Butyou know what I mean.,1941
4474,"I have no softness there,no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”",1941
4475,What _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still andlooked attentively at me?,1942
4476,Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?,1942
4477,No.,1942
4478,"In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge ofresemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have beenacquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been muchassociated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, willproduce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between facesthat are otherwise quite different.",1942
4479,And yet I could not trace this toMiss Havisham.,1942
4480,"I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,the suggestion was gone.",1942
4481,What _was_ it?,1943
4482,"“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her browwas smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrownmuch together, you had better believe it at once.",1944
4483,No!” imperiouslystopping me as I opened my lips.,1944
4484,“I have not bestowed my tendernessanywhere.,1944
4485,I have never had any such thing.”,1944
4486,"In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and shepointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that samefirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and tohave seen me standing scared below.",1945
4487,"As my eyes followed her white hand,again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossedme.",1945
4488,My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.,1945
4489,Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.,1945
4490,What _was_ it?,1946
4491,“What is the matter?” asked Estella.,1947
4492,“Are you scared again?”,1947
4493,"“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turnit off.",1948
4494,“Then you don’t?,1949
4495,Very well.,1949
4496,"It is said, at any rate.",1949
4497,"Miss Havisham willsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might belaid aside now, with other old belongings.",1949
4498,"Let us make one more roundof the garden, and then go in.",1949
4499,Come!,1949
4500,"You shall not shed tears for mycruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”",1949
4501,Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground.,1950
4502,"She held it in one handnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked.",1950
4503,"Wewalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all inbloom for me.",1950
4504,"If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks ofthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, itcould not have been more cherished in my remembrance.",1950
4505,"There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for morein her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which herbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of mydelight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patronesshad chosen us for one another.",1951
4506,Wretched boy!,1951
4507,"At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, andwould come back to dinner.",1952
4508,"The old wintry branches of chandeliers inthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted whilewe were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.",1952
4509,"It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we beganthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast.",1953
4510,"But, inthe funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in thechair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright andbeautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.",1953
4511,"The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,and Estella left us to prepare herself.",1954
4512,"We had stopped near the centreof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered armsstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellowcloth.",1954
4513,"As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at thedoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensitythat was of its kind quite dreadful.",1954
4514,"Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, andsaid in a whisper,—",1955
4515,"“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown?",1956
4516,Do you admire her?”,1956
4517,"“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”",1957
4518,"She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers asshe sat in the chair.",1958
4519,"“Love her, love her, love her!",1958
4520,How does she useyou?”,1958
4521,"Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a questionat all) she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her!",1959
4522,"If she favoursyou, love her.",1959
4523,"If she wounds you, love her.",1959
4524,"If she tears your heart topieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—loveher, love her, love her!”",1959
4525,Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to herutterance of these words.,1960
4526,I could feel the muscles of the thin armround my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.,1960
4527,"“Hear me, Pip!",1961
4528,"I adopted her, to be loved.",1961
4529,"I bred her and educated her,to be loved.",1961
4530,"I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.",1961
4531,Love her!”,1961
4532,"She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that shemeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate insteadof love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from herlips more like a curse.",1962
4533,"“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,“what real love is.",1963
4534,"It is blind devotion, unquestioningself-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourselfand against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to thesmiter—as I did!”",1963
4535,"When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caughther round the waist.",1964
4536,"For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of adress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struckherself against the wall and fallen dead.",1964
4537,All this passed in a few seconds.,1965
4538,"As I drew her down into her chair, Iwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian inthe room.",1965
4539,"He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) apocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which wasof great value to him in his profession.",1966
4540,"I have seen him so terrify aclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchiefas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, asif he knew he should not have time to do it before such client orwitness committed himself, that the self-committal has followeddirectly, quite as a matter of course.",1966
4541,"When I saw him in the room hehad this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was lookingat us.",1966
4542,"On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silentpause in that attitude, “Indeed?",1966
4543,Singular!” and then put thehandkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.,1966
4544,"Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)afraid of him.",1967
4545,"She made a strong attempt to compose herself, andstammered that he was as punctual as ever.",1967
4546,"“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us.",1968
4547,"“(How do you do,Pip?",1968
4548,"Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham?",1968
4549,Once round?),1968
4550,"And so youare here, Pip?”",1968
4551,"I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me tocome and see Estella.",1969
4552,"To which he replied, “Ah!",1969
4553,"Very fine young lady!”Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of hislarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocketwere full of secrets.",1969
4554,"“Well, Pip!",1970
4555,"How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, whenhe came to a stop.",1970
4556,“How often?”,1971
4557,“Ah!,1972
4558,How many times?,1972
4559,Ten thousand times?”,1972
4560,“Oh!,1973
4561,Certainly not so many.”,1973
4562,“Twice?”,1974
4563,"“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pipalone, and go with him to your dinner.”",1975
4564,"He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together.",1976
4565,"Whilewe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the pavedyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eatand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundredtimes and once.",1976
4566,"I considered, and said, “Never.”",1977
4567,"“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile.",1978
4568,"“She hasnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived thispresent life of hers.",1978
4569,"She wanders about in the night, and then layshands on such food as she takes.”",1978
4570,"“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”",1979
4571,"“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it.",1980
4572,Put yourquestion.”,1980
4573,“Estella’s name.,1981
4574,Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.,1981
4575,“Or what?” said he.,1982
4576,“Is it Havisham?”,1983
4577,“It is Havisham.”,1984
4578,"This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaitedus.",1985
4579,"Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my greenand yellow friend.",1985
4580,"We dined very well, and were waited on by amaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, butwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the wholetime.",1985
4581,"After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before myguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and thetwo ladies left us.",1985
4582,"Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under thatroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him.",1986
4583,"He kept his very looks tohimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once duringdinner.",1986
4584,"When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,but never looked at her, that I could see.",1986
4585,"On the other hand, she oftenlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but hisface never showed the least consciousness.",1986
4586,"Throughout dinner he took adry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by oftenreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that heextorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those referencesout of my innocent self.",1986
4587,"And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon himof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, thatreally was too much for me.",1987
4588,He cross-examined his very wine when he hadnothing else in hand.,1987
4589,"He held it between himself and the candle, tastedthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glassagain, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, andcross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I hadknown the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage.",1987
4590,"Three orfour times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever hesaw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in hishand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me totake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer.",1987
4591,"I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her inthe danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off hercap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—andstrewing the ground with her hair,—which assuredly had never grown on_her_ head.",1988
4592,"She did not appear when we afterwards went up to MissHavisham’s room, and we four played at whist.",1988
4593,"In the interval, MissHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewelsfrom her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom andarms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thickeyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.",1988
4595,"Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, andcame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which theglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally inthe light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found outlong ago.",1990
4596,"What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between hiscold presence and my feelings towards Estella.",1990
4597,"It was not that I knew Icould never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could neverbear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bearto see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should bewithin a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in thesame place with him,—_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.",1990
4598,"We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that whenEstella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and shouldmeet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched herand left her.",1991
4599,My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine.,1992
4600,"Far into thenight, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!” soundedin my ears.",1992
4601,"I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to mypillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times.",1992
4602,"Then,a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,once the blacksmith’s boy.",1992
4603,"Then I thought if she were, as I feared, byno means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would shebegin to be interested in me?",1992
4604,When should I awaken the heart within herthat was mute and sleeping now?,1992
4605,Ah me!,1993
4606,I thought those were high and great emotions.,1993
4607,"But I neverthought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,because I knew she would be contemptuous of him.",1993
4608,"It was but a day gone,and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, Godforgive me!",1993
4609,soon dried.,1993
4610,Chapter XXX.,1995
4611,"After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boarin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’sbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.",1996
4612,"“Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian,comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the manwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.” It seemedquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was notexceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in asatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick.",1996
4613,"“Verygood, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go roundpresently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summaryaction, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friendhimself might be difficult to deal with.",1996
4614,"“Oh no he won’t,” said myguardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfectconfidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with _me_.”",1996
4615,"As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as Ibreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcelyhold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted awalk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggerswas occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get intomy place when overtaken.",1997
4616,I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boarimmediately after breakfast.,1997
4617,"By then making a loop of about a couple ofmiles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, Igot round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, andfelt myself in comparative security.",1997
4618,"It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it wasnot disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and staredafter.",1998
4619,"One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shopsand went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on whichoccasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; theyof not doing it, or I of not seeing it.",1998
4620,"Still my position was adistinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, untilFate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy.",1998
4621,"Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, Ibeheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.",1999
4622,"Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would bestbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advancedwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulatingmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smotetogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently inevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,“Hold me!",1999
4623,"I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror andcontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.",1999
4624,"As I passedhim, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark ofextreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.",1999
4625,"This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing.",2000
4626,"I had not advancedanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching.",2000
4627,He was cominground a narrow corner.,2000
4628,"His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honestindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s withcheerful briskness was indicated in his gait.",2000
4629,"With a shock he becameaware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time hismotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with kneesmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy.",2000
4630,"Hissufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,and I felt utterly confounded.",2000
4631,"I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, whenI again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way.",2001
4632,"This time, hewas entirely changed.",2001
4633,"He wore the blue bag in the manner of mygreat-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on theopposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted youngfriends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of hishand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravationand injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me,he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an armakimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’ponmy soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediatelyafterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge withcrows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I wasa blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, andwas, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.",2001
4635,"But unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, Ireally do not even now see what I could have done save endure.",2003
4636,"To havestruggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lowerrecompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futileand degrading.",2003
4637,"Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; aninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flewout again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping.",2003
4638,"I wrote,however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip mustdecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owedto the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excitedLoathing in every respectable mind.",2003
4639,"The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took mybox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heartwas gone.",2004
4640,"As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrelof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and thenwent on to Barnard’s Inn.",2004
4641,"I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.",2005
4642,"Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition tothe dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to myfriend and chum.",2005
4643,"As confidence was out of the question with The Avengerin the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of anantechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play.",2005
4644,"A better proof ofthe severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely beafforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven tofind him employment.",2005
4645,"So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him toHyde Park corner to see what o’clock it was.",2005
4646,"Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said toHerbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tellyou.”",2006
4647,"“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect yourconfidence.”",2007
4648,"“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”",2008
4649,"Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because Ididn’t go on.",2009
4650,"“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—Iadore—Estella.”",2010
4651,"Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easymatter-of-course way, “Exactly.",2011
4652,Well?”,2011
4653,"“Well, Herbert?",2012
4654,Is that all you say?,2012
4655,Well?”,2012
4656,"“What next, I mean?” said Herbert.",2013
4657,“Of course I know _that_.”,2013
4658,“How do you know it?” said I.,2014
4659,"“How do I know it, Handel?",2015
4660,"Why, from you.”",2015
4661,“I never told you.”,2016
4662,“Told me!,2017
4663,"You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but Ihave had senses to perceive it.",2017
4664,"You have always adored her, ever sinceI have known you.",2017
4665,You brought your adoration and your portmanteau heretogether.,2017
4666,Told me!,2017
4667,"Why, you have always told me all day long.",2017
4668,"When youtold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring herthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.”",2017
4669,"“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcomelight, “I have never left off adoring her.",2018
4670,"And she has come back, amost beautiful and most elegant creature.",2018
4671,And I saw her yesterday.,2018
4672,"Andif I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”",2018
4673,"“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked outfor her and allotted to her.",2019
4674,"Without encroaching on forbidden ground,we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves ofthat fact.",2019
4675,"Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the adorationquestion?”",2019
4676,I shook my head gloomily.,2020
4677,“Oh!,2020
4678,"She is thousands of miles away, fromme,” said I.",2020
4679,"“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough.",2021
4680,But you havesomething more to say?”,2021
4681,"“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say itthan to think it.",2022
4682,You call me a lucky fellow.,2022
4683,"Of course, I am.",2022
4684,I was ablacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”,2022
4685,"“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling,and clapping his hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, withimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action anddreaming, curiously mixed in him.”",2023
4686,I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was thismixture in my character.,2024
4687,"On the whole, I by no means recognised theanalysis, but thought it not worth disputing.",2024
4688,"“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “Isuggest what I have in my thoughts.",2025
4689,You say I am lucky.,2025
4690,"I know I havedone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raisedme; that is being very lucky.",2025
4691,"And yet, when I think of Estella—”",2025
4692,"(“And when don’t you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his eyes on thefire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)",2026
4693,"“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertainI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances.",2027
4694,"Avoiding forbiddenground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy ofone person (naming no person) all my expectations depend.",2027
4695,"And at thebest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely whatthey are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always beenthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.",2027
4696,"“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems tome that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking intoour gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass.",2028
4697,"Likewise, it seems tome that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogetheroverlook one of the best points of the animal.",2028
4698,"Didn’t you tell me thatyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you werenot endowed with expectations only?",2028
4699,"And even if he had not told youso,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that ofall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relationstowards you unless he were sure of his ground?”",2028
4700,I said I could not deny that this was a strong point.,2029
4701,"I said it (peopleoften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truthand justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!",2029
4702,"“I should think it _was_ a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I shouldthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, youmust bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.",2030
4703,"You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and thenperhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment.",2030
4704,"At all events, you’ll benearer getting it, for it must come at last.”",2030
4705,"“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring hischeery ways.",2031
4706,"“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else.",2032
4707,"I mustacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said isnot my own, but my father’s.",2032
4708,"The only remark I ever heard him make onyour story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mr.Jaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more aboutmy father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, Iwant to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for amoment,—positively repulsive.”",2032
4709,"“You won’t succeed,” said I.",2033
4710,“O yes I shall!” said he.,2034
4711,"“One, two, three, and now I am in for it.",2034
4712,"Handel, my good fellow;”—though he spoke in this light tone, he wasvery much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talkingwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a conditionof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian.",2034
4713,"AmI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he neverreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way?",2034
4714,"Never even hinted,for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriageultimately?”",2034
4715,“Never.”,2035
4716,"“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon mysoul and honour!",2036
4717,"Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourselffrom her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”",2036
4718,"I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the oldmarsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which hadsubdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists weresolemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,smote upon my heart again.",2037
4719,There was silence between us for a littlewhile.,2037
4720,"“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast ofa boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it veryserious.",2038
4721,"Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham.",2038
4722,Think ofwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me).,2038
4723,This maylead to miserable things.”,2038
4724,"“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but Ican’t help it.”",2039
4725,“You can’t detach yourself?”,2040
4726,“No.,2041
4727,Impossible!”,2041
4728,"“You can’t try, Handel?”",2042
4729,“No.,2043
4730,Impossible!”,2043
4731,"“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had beenasleep, and stirring the fire, “now I’ll endeavour to make myselfagreeable again!”",2044
4732,"So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs intheir places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, andcame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his leftleg in both arms.",2045
4733,"“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and myfather’s son.",2046
4734,I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father’s sonto remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliantin its housekeeping.”,2046
4735,"“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I, to say somethingencouraging.",2047
4736,“O yes!,2048
4737,"and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongestapproval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.",2048
4738,"Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is aswell as I do.",2048
4739,"I suppose there was a time once when my father had notgiven matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone.",2048
4740,"May I askyou if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your partof the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages arealways most particularly anxious to be married?”",2048
4741,"This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is itso?”",2049
4742,"“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know.",2050

4750,"“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”",2052
4751,"I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured withfurther particulars.",2053
4752,He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of myweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.,2053

4892,Have you time to spare?”,2118

4894,"Muttering that I would make the inquirywhether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, andascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to thetrying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could beexpected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he.",2119
4895,"I then rejoinedMr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised bythe information I had received, accepted his offer.",2119

4900,It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardenermight walk among his plants.,2121

4902,Are _you_ there?,2121
4903,"Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that BlackBill behind the cistern?",2121
4904,"Why I didn’t look for you these two months;how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars andattending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with hispost-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.",2121
4905,"He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar departmentof Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggershung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits.",2122

4912,Don’t try on useless measures.,2122
4913,Why shouldyou?,2122
4914,"Now, who’s next?”",2122
4915,"Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me andsaid, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so,without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.",2123
4916,"Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can seenow, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with apeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes thatwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner ofthe bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fattysurface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose militarysalute.",2124
4917,"“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”",2125
4918,"“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”",2126
4919,"“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was toostrong for us, Colonel.”",2127
4920,"“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.”",2128
4921,"“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “_you_ don’t care.” Then, turning tome, “Served His Majesty this man.",2129
4922,Was a soldier in the line and boughthis discharge.”,2129
4923,"I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked overmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand acrosshis lips and laughed.",2130
4924,"“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.",2131
4925,"“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”",2132
4926,"“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,”said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.",2133
4927,"“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him.",2134
4928,"“Same to you,Colonel.”",2134
4929,"“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said theman, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour ofyour wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”",2135
4930,"“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick.",2136
4931,“By the by; you werequite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky.,2136

4935,"“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.",2138
4936,"Good-afternoon, Colonel.",2138
4937,"Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as wewalked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman.",2138
4938,"TheRecorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed onMonday.",2138
4939,"Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons areportable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and noddedat this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out ofthe yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in itsplace.",2138
4940,"As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the greatimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less thanby those whom they held in charge.",2139
4941,"“Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said theturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder?",2139
4942,"Is he going to make itmanslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”",2139
4943,“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.,2140
4944,"“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.",2141
4945,"“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick,turning to me with his post-office elongated.",2142
4946,"“They don’t mind whatthey ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking anyquestions of my principal.”",2142
4947,"“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of youroffice?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humour.",2143
4948,"“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so!",2144
4949,Asksanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry!,2144
4950,"Well,supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”",2144
4951,"“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr.Jaggers is.”",2145
4952,"“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in afacetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to dowith my principal, you know you are.",2146
4953,"Let us out, you old fox, or I’llget him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”",2146
4954,"The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at usover the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into thestreet.",2147
4955,"“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my armto be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a betterthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high.",2148
4956,He’s always sohigh.,2148
4957,His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.,2148
4958,"That Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durstask him his intentions respecting a case.",2148
4959,"Then, between his height andthem, he slips in his subordinate,—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em,soul and body.”",2148
4960,"I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’ssubtlety.",2149
4961,"To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for thefirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.",2149
4962,"Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, wheresuppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, andI returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with somethree hours on hand.",2150

4987,"Upon that,he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which hecouldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of theestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluousarticle, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,and somebody’s pattens.",2160
4988,"On my objecting to this retreat, he took usinto another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate ascorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust.",2160
4989,"Having lookedat this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out ofthe room in a very low state of mind.",2160
4990,"I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strongcombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer thatthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprisingproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.",2161
4991,"Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it.",2161
4992,I thought thatwith her I could have been happy there for life.,2161
4993,"(I was not at allhappy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)",2161
4994,"“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.",2162
4995,"“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there,who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducingme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”",2163
4996,“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”,2164
4997,"“Yes, I suppose so.”",2165
4998,"She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as ifyou were some one else.”",2166
4999,“Where did you learn how I speak of others?,2167
5000,"Come, come,” said Estella,smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;I must talk in my own way.",2167
5001,How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”,2167
5002,“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I waslosing a chance.,2168
5003,“At least?” repeated Estella.,2169
5004,"“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”",2170
5005,"“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk suchnonsense?",2171
5006,"Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the restof his family?”",2171
5007,“Very superior indeed.,2172
5008,He is nobody’s enemy—”,2172
5009,"“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class ofman.",2173
5010,"But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy andspite, I have heard?”",2173
5011,“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”,2174
5012,"“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” saidEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at oncegrave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports andinsinuations to your disadvantage.",2175
5013,"They watch you, misrepresent you,write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the tormentand the occupation of their lives.",2175
5014,You can scarcely realise to yourselfthe hatred those people feel for you.”,2175
5015,"“They do me no harm, I hope?”",2176
5016,"Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing.",2177
5017,"This was verysingular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity.",2177
5018,"Whenshe left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with realenjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—",2177
5019,“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me anyharm.”,2178
5020,"“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella.",2179
5021,“You may be certainthat I laugh because they fail.,2179
5022,"O, those people with Miss Havisham, andthe tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and even now when shehad told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could notdoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.",2179
5023,"Ithought there must really be something more here than I knew; she sawthe thought in my mind, and answered it.",2179
5024,"“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfactionit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense ofthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous.",2180
5025,For you were notbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby.,2180
5026,I was.,2180
5027,"You had notyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressedand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not thatis soft and soothing.",2180
5028,I had.,2180
5029,You did not gradually open your roundchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of awoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes upin the night.,2180
5030,I did.”,2180
5031,"It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning theseremembrances from any shallow place.",2181
5032,I would not have been the cause ofthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.,2181
5033,"“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella.",2182
5034,"“First, notwithstanding theproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set yourmind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundredyears—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, greator small.",2182
5035,"Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being sobusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”",2182
5036,"As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been butmomentary—I held it and put it to my lips.",2183
5037,"“You ridiculous boy,” saidEstella, “will you never take warning?",2183
5038,Or do you kiss my hand in thesame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”,2183
5039,“What spirit was that?” said I.,2184
5040,“I must think a moment.,2185
5041,A spirit of contempt for the fawners andplotters.”,2185
5042,"“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”",2186
5043,“You should have asked before you touched the hand.,2187
5044,"But, yes, if youlike.”",2187
5045,"I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s.",2188
5046,"“Now,” saidEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to takecare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”",2188
5047,"Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in ourintercourse did give me pain.",2189
5048,"Whatever her tone with me happened to be,I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went onagainst trust and against hope.",2189
5049,Why repeat it a thousand times?,2189
5050,So italways was.,2189
5051,"I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but oftea not a glimpse.",2190
5052,"A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives andforks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meeklittle muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong ironcover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in aquantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proofimpressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits ofbread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered inwith, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering.",2190
5053,"After aprolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length cameback with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs.",2190
5054,"These Isteeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliancesextracted one cup of I don’t know what for Estella.",2190
5055,"The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the wholehouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’spurse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.",2191
5056,"Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soonunder the walls of which I was so ashamed.",2191
5057,“What place is that?” Estella asked me.,2192
5058,"I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then toldher.",2193
5059,"As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for anyconsideration.",2193
5060,“Mr.,2194
5061,"Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,“has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal placethan any man in London.”",2194
5062,"“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in alow voice.",2195
5063,"“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”",2196
5064,"“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since Ican remember.",2197
5065,"But I know him no better now, than I did before I couldspeak plainly.",2197
5066,What is your own experience of him?,2197
5067,Do you advance withhim?”,2197
5068,"“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done verywell.”",2198
5069,“Are you intimate?”,2199
5070,“I have dined with him at his private house.”,2200
5071,"“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”",2201
5072,“It is a curious place.”,2202
5073,"I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even withher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describethe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a suddenglare of gas.",2203
5074,"It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alivewith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were outof it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been inlightning.",2203
5075,"So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way bywhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on thisside of it, and what on that.",2204
5076,"The great city was almost new to her, shetold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until shehad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then ingoing and returning.",2204
5077,I asked her if my guardian had any charge of herwhile she remained here?,2204
5078,To that she emphatically said “God forbid!”and no more.,2204
5079,"It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the taskhad needed pains.",2205
5080,"Yet this made me none the happier, for even if shehad not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I shouldhave felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully choseto do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her tocrush it and throw it away.",2205
5081,"When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. MatthewPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that Ihoped I should see her sometimes.",2206
5082,"“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; youare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”",2207
5083,I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?,2208
5084,“No; there are only two; mother and daughter.,2209
5085,"The mother is a lady ofsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.”",2209
5086,“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”,2210
5087,"“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, witha sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and seeher regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they arenearly all mine now.”",2211
5088,It was the first time she had ever called me by my name.,2212
5089,"Of course shedid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.",2212
5090,"We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a houseby the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had theircourt days many a time.",2213
5091,"Some ancient trees before the house were stillcut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs andstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession ofthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and gothe silent way of the rest.",2213
5092,"A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said tothe house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hiltedsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—soundedgravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came flutteringout to receive Estella.",2214
5093,"The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and shegave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbedlikewise.",2214
5094,"And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy Ishould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happywith her, but always miserable.",2214
5095,"I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got inwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache.",2215
5096,"At ourown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little partyescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spiteof his being subject to Flopson.",2215
5097,"Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer ondomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children andservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes.",2216
5098,"ButMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account ofthe baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep himquiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the FootGuards) of Millers.",2216
5099,And more needles were missing than it could beregarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years eitherto apply externally or to take as a tonic.,2216
5100,"Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practicaladvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and ahighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begginghim to accept my confidence.",2217
5101,"But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket asshe sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as asovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn’t.",2217
5102,Chapter XXXIV.,2219
5103,"As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun tonotice their effect upon myself and those around me.",2220
5104,"Their influence onmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,but I knew very well that it was not all good.",2220
5105,I lived in a state ofchronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe.,2220
5106,My conscience wasnot by any means comfortable about Biddy.,2220
5107,"When I woke up in thenight,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen MissHavisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners withJoe in the honest old forge.",2220
5108,"Many a time of an evening, when I satalone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire likethe forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.",2220
5109,"Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet ofmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own partin its production.",2221
5110,"That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to mysatisfaction that I should have done much better.",2221
5111,"Now, concerning theinfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and soI perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial toanybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.",2221
5112,"Mylavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could notafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peacewith anxieties and regrets.",2221
5113,"I was not at all remorseful for havingunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poorarts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left themslumbering.",2221
5114,"But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it oftencaused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service incrowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholsterywork, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.",2221
5115,"So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I beganto contract a quantity of debt.",2222
5116,"I could hardly begin but Herbert mustbegin too, so he soon followed.",2222
5117,"At Startop’s suggestion, we putourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of theGrove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it werenot that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, toquarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to causesix waiters to get drunk on the stairs.",2222
5118,"I know that these gratifyingsocial ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and Iunderstood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toastof the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of goodfeeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”",2222
5119,"The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was inCovent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour ofjoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering abouttown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the postsat the street corners.",2223
5120,"Occasionally, he shot himself out of hisequipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasiondeliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—likecoals.",2223
5121,"But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and couldnot be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came ofage.",2223
5122,"In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have takenHerbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could makeno such proposal to him.",2224
5123,"So he got into difficulties in everydirection, and continued to look about him.",2224
5124,"When we gradually fell intokeeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about himwith a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look abouthim more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came intodinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, ratherclearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towardsmidnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became sodeeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going toAmerica, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make hisfortune.",2224
5125,"I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was atHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by.",2225
5126,"Herbertwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at thoseseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception thatthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet.",2225
5127,"But in thegeneral tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,was a thing to transact itself somehow.",2225
5128,"In the meantime Mr. Pocket grewgreyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities bythe hair.",2225
5129,"While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us abouther grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting itinto bed whenever it attracted her notice.",2225
5130,"As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object ofclearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at oncecompleting the description of our usual manners and customs atBarnard’s Inn.",2226
5131,"We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as peoplecould make up their minds to give us.",2227
5132,"We were always more or lessmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.",2227
5133,"There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoyingourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did.",2227
5134,"To the best of mybelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.",2227
5135,"Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to lookabout him.",2228
5136,"I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which heconsorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, analmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that Iever saw him do anything else but look about him.",2228
5137,"If we all did what weundertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in aRepublic of the Virtues.",2228
5138,"He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, exceptat a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observanceof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think.",2228
5139,"He never did anythingelse in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come backagain.",2228
5140,"When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positivelymust find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walkin and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among theassembled magnates.",2228
5141,"“For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner onone of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, thatan opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”",2228
5142,"If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hatedone another regularly every morning.",2229
5143,"I detested the chambers beyondexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sightof the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a lessremunerative appearance then than at any other time in thefour-and-twenty hours.",2229
5144,"As we got more and more into debt, breakfastbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion atbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “notunwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake himoff his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a bootedCupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.",2229
5145,"At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on ourhumour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—",2230
5146,"“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”",2231
5147,"“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if youwill believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strangecoincidence.”",2232
5148,"“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”",2233
5149,We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment forthis purpose.,2234
5150,"I always thought this was business, this was the way toconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat.",2234
5151,AndI know Herbert thought so too.,2234
5152,"We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle ofsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our mindsmight be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to themark.",2235
5153,"Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply ofink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper.",2235
5154,For there wassomething very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.,2235
5155,"I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, ina neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’sInn and the date very carefully added.",2236
5156,"Herbert would also take a sheetof paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum ofHerbert’s debts.”",2236
5157,"Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, halfburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, andotherwise damaged.",2237
5158,"The sound of our pens going refreshed usexceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult todistinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actuallypaying the money.",2237
5159,"In point of meritorious character, the two thingsseemed about equal.",2237
5160,"When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?",2238
5161,Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most ruefulmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.,2238
5162,"“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, theyare mounting up.”",2239
5163,"“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with greatassiduity.",2240
5164,“Look the thing in the face.,2240
5165,Look into your affairs.,2240
5166,Starethem out of countenance.”,2240
5167,"“So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.”",2241
5168,"However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert wouldfall to work again.",2242
5169,"After a time he would give up once more, on theplea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as thecase might be.",2242
5170,"“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put itdown.”",2243
5171,"“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, withadmiration.",2244
5172,“Really your business powers are very remarkable.”,2244
5173,I thought so too.,2245
5174,"I established with myself, on these occasions, thereputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,energetic, clear, cool-headed.",2245
5175,"When I had got all my responsibilitiesdown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off.",2245
5176,Myself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.,2245
5177,"When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetricalbundle.",2245
5178,"Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had notmy administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs intoa focus for him.",2245
5179,"My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be onehundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave amargin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to befour times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at sevenhundred.",2246
5180,"I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to havebeen an expensive device.",2246
5181,"For, we always ran into new debt immediately,to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense offreedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into anothermargin.",2246
5182,"But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on theseexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirableopinion of myself.",2247
5183,"Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’scompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on thetable before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of somesort, rather than a private individual.",2247
5184,"We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that wemight not be interrupted.",2248
5185,"I had fallen into my serene state oneevening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the saiddoor, and fall on the ground.",2248
5186,"“It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing thematter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.",2248
5187,"The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that Iwas an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes pastsix in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at theinterment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.",2249
5188,Chapter XXXV.,2251
5189,"It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, andthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful.",2252
5190,"The figure of mysister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day.",2252
5191,"Thatthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemedunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in mythoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was comingtowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at thedoor.",2252
5192,"In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion ofthe sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if shewere still alive and had been often there.",2252
5193,"Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled mysister with much tenderness.",2253
5194,But I suppose there is a shock of regretwhich may exist without much tenderness.,2253
5195,"Under its influence (andperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seizedwith a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she hadsuffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could haverevengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.",2253
5196,"Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him thatI would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in thecurious state of mind I have glanced at.",2254
5197,"I went down early in themorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to theforge.",2254
5198,"It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the timeswhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,vividly returned.",2255
5199,But they returned with a gentle tone upon them thatsoftened even the edge of Tickler.,2255
5200,"For now, the very breath of thebeans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when itwould be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine shouldbe softened as they thought of me.",2255
5201,"At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.had put in a funereal execution and taken possession.",2256
5202,"Two dismallyabsurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in ablack bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate anycomfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them Irecognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a youngcouple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence ofintoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse claspedround the neck with both arms.",2256
5203,"All the children of the village, andmost of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closedwindows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the twowarders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far toomuch exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.",2256
5204,"Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for awager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour.",2257
5205,"Here, Mr.Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leavesup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantityof black pins.",2257
5206,"At the moment of my arrival, he had just finishedputting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;so he held out his hand for mine.",2257
5207,"But I, misled by the action, andconfused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony ofwarm affection.",2257
5208,"Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bowunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb.",2258
5209,"When I bentdown and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my handand said no more.",2258
5210,"Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietlyhere and there, and was very helpful.",2259
5211,"When I had spoken to Biddy, as Ithought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, andthere began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.",2259
5212,"The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, Ilooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visibleuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plumcake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, andbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but hadnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.",2259
5213,"Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechookin a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternatelystuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch myattention.",2259
5214,"The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathingsherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” anddid.",2259
5215,I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decentspeechless paroxysm in a corner.,2259
5216,"We were all going to “follow,” andwere all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) intoridiculous bundles.",2259
5217,"“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.Trabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two,—and it wasdreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which Imeantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to thechurch myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to itwith willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbourswould look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting inrespect.”",2260
5218,"“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in adepressed business-like voice.",2261
5219,“Pocket-handkerchiefs out!,2261
5220,We areready!”,2261
5221,"So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noseswere bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy andPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble.",2262
5222,"The remains of my poor sister hadbeen brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point ofUndertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blindedunder a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the wholelooked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling andblundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy andhis comrade.",2262
5223,"The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, andwe were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthfuland vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut usoff, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage.",2263
5224,"At suchtimes the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner onour emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”“_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered.",2263
5225,"In this progress I wasmuch annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persistedall the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,and smoothing my cloak.",2263
5226,"My thoughts were further distracted by theexcessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceitedand vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.",2263
5227,"And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of theships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of thisparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.",2264
5228,"And there, my sister waslaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and thelight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.",2264
5229,"Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that evenwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how itbrought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how itfleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard himcough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who cameunexpectedly into large property.",2265
5230,"When we got back, he had thehardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I haddone her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered itreasonably purchased at the price of her death.",2265
5231,"After that, he drankall the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the twotalked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) asif they were of quite another race from the deceased, and werenotoriously immortal.",2265
5232,"Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the JollyBargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliestbenefactor.",2265
5233,"When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; Ilooked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,the house felt wholesomer.",2266
5234,"Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had acold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the oldkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with hisknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was greatrestraint upon us.",2266
5235,"But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, andwhen I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat downtogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better.",2266
5236,"Inoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as tomake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in whichthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.",2266
5237,"He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own littleroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a greatthing in making the request.",2267
5238,"When the shadows of evening were closingin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for alittle talk.",2267
5239,"“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sadmatters.”",2268
5240,"“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy.",2269
5241,“I should have written if I had thoughtthat.”,2269
5242,"“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I considerthat you ought to have thought that.”",2270
5243,"“Do you, Mr. Pip?”",2271
5244,"She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way withher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again.",2272
5245,"Afterlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gaveup that point.",2272
5246,"“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddydear?”",2273
5247,“Oh!,2274
5248,"I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but stillof quiet conviction.",2274
5249,"“I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I amgoing to her to-morrow.",2274
5250,"I hope we shall be able to take some care ofMr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”",2274
5251,"“How are you going to live, Biddy?",2275
5252,If you want any mo—”,2275
5253,"“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentaryflush upon her face.",2276
5254,"“I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip.",2276
5255,I am going to try to getthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here.,2276
5256,"I can bewell recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industriousand patient, and teach myself while I teach others.",2276
5257,"You know, Mr. Pip,”pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “thenew schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from youafter that time, and have had time since then to improve.”",2276
5258,"“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”",2277
5259,“Ah!,2278
5260,"Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.",2278
5261,It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud.,2279
5262,Well!,2279
5263,I thought I would give up that point too.,2279
5264,"So, I walked a little furtherwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.",2279
5265,"“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”",2280
5266,"“They are very slight, poor thing.",2281
5267,"She had been in one of her badstates—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for fourdays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, andsaid quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a longwhile, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge.",2281
5268,"She made signsto me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me toput her arms round his neck.",2281
5269,"So I put them round his neck, and she laidher head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied.",2281
5270,"And so shepresently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’ And soshe never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour laterwhen we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”",2281
5271,"Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars thatwere coming out, were blurred in my own sight.",2282
5272,"“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”",2283
5273,“Nothing.”,2284
5274,“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”,2285
5275,“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working inthe quarries.”,2286
5276,“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that darktree in the lane?”,2287
5277,"“I saw him there, on the night she died.”",2288
5278,"“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”",2289
5279,"“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is ofno use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for runningout, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, andhe is gone.”",2290
5280,"It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued bythis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him.",2291
5281,"I told her so, and toldher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out ofthat country.",2291
5282,"By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and shetold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—shedidn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever didhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and agentle heart.",2291
5283,"“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy,we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be oftendown here now.",2292
5284,I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”,2292
5285,Biddy said never a single word.,2293
5286,"“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”",2294
5287,"“Yes, Mr. Pip.”",2295
5288,"“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be inbad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”",2296
5289,"“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.",2297
5290,"“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must requestto know what you mean by this?”",2298
5291,“By this?” said Biddy.,2299
5292,"“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted.",2300
5293,"“You used not to echo, Biddy.”",2300
5294,“Used not!” said Biddy.,2301
5295,“O Mr. Pip!,2301
5296,Used!”,2301
5297,Well!,2302
5298,I rather thought I would give up that point too.,2302
5299,"After anothersilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.",2302
5300,"“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence.",2303
5301,"Have thegoodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”",2303
5302,"“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” askedBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under thestars with a clear and honest eye.",2304
5303,"“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy indespair.",2305
5304,“This really is a very bad side of human nature!,2305
5305,"Don’t say anymore, if you please, Biddy.",2305
5306,This shocks me very much.”,2305
5307,"For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, andwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave ofher as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with thechurchyard and the event of the day.",2306
5308,"As often as I was restless in thenight, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what anunkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.",2306
5309,Early in the morning I was to go.,2307
5310,"Early in the morning I was out, andlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge.",2307
5311,"There Istood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow ofhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the brightsun of the life in store for him were shining on it.",2307
5312,"“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me yourblackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”",2308
5314,"“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”",2310
5315,"Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milkand a crust of bread.",2311
5316,"“Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand atparting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”",2311
5317,"“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me behurt, if I have been ungenerous.”",2312
5318,"Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away.",2313
5319,"If they disclosed tome, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and thatBiddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.",2313

5321,"Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing ourdebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the likeexemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has away of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert’s prediction,that I should do so before I knew where I was.",2316
5322,Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me.,2317
5323,"As he hadnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make aprofound sensation in Barnard’s Inn.",2317
5324,"But we had looked forward to myone-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations andanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardlyhelp saying something definite on that occasion.",2317
5325,I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when mybirthday was.,2318
5326,"On the day before it, I received an official note fromWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would callupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.",2318
5327,"This convincedus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusualflutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a model ofpunctuality.",2318
5328,"In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, andincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece oftissue-paper that I liked the look of.",2319
5329,"But he said nothing respectingit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room.",2319
5330,"It wasNovember, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his backagainst the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.",2319
5331,"“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip to-day.",2320
5332,"Congratulations,Mr. Pip.”",2320
5333,"We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thankedhim.",2321
5334,"“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.",2322
5335,"As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at hisboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old timewhen I had been put upon a tombstone.",2323
5336,"The two ghastly casts on theshelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they weremaking a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.",2323
5337,"“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in thebox, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”",2324
5338,"“If you please, sir.”",2325
5339,"“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at theground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“whatdo you suppose you are living at the rate of?”",2326
5340,"“At the rate of, sir?”",2327
5341,"“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,“the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with hispocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.",2328
5342,"I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyedany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings.",2329
5343,"Reluctantly,I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question.",2329
5344,"This replyseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew hisnose with an air of satisfaction.",2329
5345,"“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.",2330
5346,“Have you anything to ask _me_?”,2330
5347,"“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you severalquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”",2331

5354,"I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape fromthe inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggerssaid, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called toWemmick to give him that piece of paper.",2337
5355,"Wemmick appeared, handed itin, and disappeared.",2337

5363,"You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you.",2342
5364,"Now, take thispiece of paper in your hand.",2342
5365,You have got it?,2342

5371,You consider it so?”,2344
5372,“How could I do otherwise!”,2345

5377,"Now, thathandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own.",2348
5378,"It is a present to you on thisday, in earnest of your expectations.",2348
5379,"And at the rate of that handsomesum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live untilthe donor of the whole appears.",2348

5390,"I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took meaback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.",2353
5391,"“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, thefountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there Idelicately stopped.",2353
5392,“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers.,2354
5393,"“That’s no question as it stands,you know.”",2354
5394,"“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a preciseform of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”",2355
5395,"“Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with hisdark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we firstencountered one another in your village.",2356
5396,"What did I tell you then,Pip?”",2356
5397,"“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when thatperson appeared.”",2357
5398,"“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers, “that’s my answer.”",2358
5399,"As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in mystrong desire to get something out of him.",2359
5400,"And as I felt that it camequicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that Ihad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.",2359
5401,"“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”",2360
5402,"Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but inaltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answerit,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when myeyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in theirsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.",2361
5403,"“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backsof his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip.",2362
5404,That’s aquestion I must not be asked.,2362
5405,"You’ll understand that better, when Itell you it’s a question that might compromise _me_.",2362
5406,Come!,2362
5407,I’ll go alittle further with you; I’ll say something more.”,2362
5408,"He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub thecalves of his legs in the pause he made.",2363
5409,"“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,“you and that person will settle your own affairs.",2364
5410,"When that persondiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine.",2364
5411,"When thatperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anythingabout it.",2364
5412,And that’s all I have got to say.”,2364
5413,"We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and lookedthoughtfully at the floor.",2365
5414,"From this last speech I derived the notionthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken himinto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that heresented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really didobject to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it.",2365
5415,"When Iraised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at meall the time, and was doing so still.",2365
5416,"“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can benothing left for me to say.”",2366
5417,"He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked mewhere I was going to dine?",2367
5418,"I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.",2367
5419,"As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with hiscompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation.",2367
5420,"But he insisted onwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparationfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) hadhis hands to wash.",2367
5421,So I said I would go into the outer office and talkto Wemmick.,2367
5422,"The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into mypocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often therebefore; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advisewith concerning such thought.",2368
5423,"He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for goinghome.",2369
5424,"He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy officecandlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab nearthe door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put hishat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chestwith his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.",2369
5425,“Mr.,2370
5426,"Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion.",2370
5427,I am very desirousto serve a friend.”,2370
5428,"Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinionwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.",2371
5429,"“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, buthas no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make abeginning.",2372
5430,Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”,2372
5431,"“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.",2373
5432,"“With _some_ money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shotacross me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with _some_money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”",2374
5433,“Mr.,2375
5434,"Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on myfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high asChelsea Reach.",2375
5435,"Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two;Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of hissafe-key on the palm of his hand.",2375
5436,"“There’s as many as six, you see, tochoose from.”",2375
5437,"“I don’t understand you,” said I.",2376
5438,"“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk uponyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre archof your bridge, and you know the end of it.",2377
5439,"Serve a friend with it, andyou may know the end of it too,—but it’s a less pleasant and profitableend.”",2377
5440,"I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide aftersaying this.",2378
5441,"“This is very discouraging,” said I.",2379
5442,"“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.",2380
5443,"“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,“that a man should never—”",2381
5444,“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick.,2382
5445,“Certainly heshould not.,2382
5446,"Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then itbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to getrid of him.”",2382
5447,"“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”",2383
5448,"“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”",2384
5449,"“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loopholehere; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”",2385
5450,“Mr.,2386
5451,"Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and thisoffice is another.",2386
5452,"Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers isanother.",2386
5453,They must not be confounded together.,2386
5454,My Walworth sentimentsmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be takenin this office.”,2386
5455,"“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up atWalworth, you may depend upon it.”",2387
5456,“Mr.,2388
5457,"Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private andpersonal capacity.”",2388
5458,"We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing myguardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp.",2389
5459,"As he now appeared inhis doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat andstood by to snuff out the candles.",2389
5460,"We all three went into the streettogether, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.Jaggers and I turned ours.",2389
5461,"I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggershad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or aSomebody, to unbend his brows a little.",2390
5462,"It was an uncomfortableconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at allseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as hemade of it.",2390
5463,"He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer thanWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick todinner.",2390
5464,"And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyesfixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony andforgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.",2390
5465,Chapter XXXVII.,2392
5466,"Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworthsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimageto the Castle.",2393
5467,"On arriving before the battlements, I found the UnionJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show ofdefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a mostpacific manner by the Aged.",2393
5468,"“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “ratherhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left wordthat he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk.",2394
5469,"He is veryregular in his walks, is my son.",2394
5470,"Very regular in everything, is myson.”",2394
5471,"I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, andwe went in and sat down by the fireside.",2395
5472,"“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in hischirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, Iexpect?” I nodded.",2396
5473,“Hah!,2396
5474,"I have heerd that my son is a wonderful handat his business, sir?” I nodded hard.",2396
5475,“Yes; so they tell me.,2396
5476,Hisbusiness is the Law?” I nodded harder.,2396
5477,"“Which makes it more surprisingin my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law,but to the Wine-Coopering.”",2396
5478,"Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning thereputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him.",2397
5479,"He threw me intothe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a verysprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to this hour Ihave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought Ihad made.",2397
5480,"As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without makingsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether hisown calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of strainingthat term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman onthe chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making mymeaning understood.",2398
5481,"“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing.",2399
5482,"First,over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe heintended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of Londonhere.",2399
5483,"However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”",2399
5484,I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.,2400
5485,"“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son hewent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little andlittle made out this elegant and beautiful property.",2401
5486,"But returning towhat you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,“what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”",2401
5487,"I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabledme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as thisimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wallon one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a littlewooden flap with “JOHN” upon it.",2402
5488,"The old man, following my eyes, criedwith great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to thedrawbridge.",2402
5489,"It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from theother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it withthe greatest ease.",2403
5490,"The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick hadcome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom hewas accompanied.",2403
5491,"Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, inthe post-office branch of the service.",2404
5492,"She might have been some two orthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessedof portable property.",2404
5493,"The cut of her dress from the waist upward, bothbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I mighthave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her glovesa little too intensely green.",2404
5494,"But she seemed to be a good sort offellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged.",2404
5495,"I was not long indiscovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on ourgoing in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance forannouncing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for amoment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared.",2404
5496,"Presentlyanother click came, and another little door tumbled open with “MissSkiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; thenMiss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut uptogether.",2404
5497,"On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and hesaid, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.",2404
5498,"And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all thepeople who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only knownto the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”",2404
5499,"“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own handsout of his own head.”",2405
5500,"While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her greengloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there wascompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round theproperty, and see how the island looked in wintertime.",2406
5501,"Thinking that hedid this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, Iseized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.",2406
5502,"Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if Ihad never hinted at it before.",2407
5503,"I informed Wemmick that I was anxious inbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and howwe had fought.",2407
5504,"I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, andat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;those, uncertain and unpunctual.",2407
5505,"I alluded to the advantages I hadderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and Iconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he mighthave done better without me and my expectations.",2407
5506,"Keeping Miss Havishamin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at thepossibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at thecertainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above anymean distrusts, retaliations, or designs.",2407
5507,"For all these reasons (I toldWemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had agreat affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect somerays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experienceand knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with myresources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred ayear, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him onto some small partnership.",2407
5508,"I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, tounderstand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’sknowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the worldwith whom I could advise.",2407
5509,"I wound up by laying my hand upon hisshoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know itmust be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having everbrought me here.”",2407
5510,"Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind ofstart, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing.",2408
5511,This isdevilish good of you.”,2408
5512,"“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.",2409
5513,"“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”",2410
5514,"“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.",2411
5515,"“You are right,” he returned.",2412
5516,“You hit the nail on the head.,2412
5517,"Mr. Pip,I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may bedone by degrees.",2412
5518,Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant andagent.,2412
5519,I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”,2412
5520,“I thank you ten thousand times.”,2413
5521,"“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly inour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”",2414
5522,"After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returnedinto the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea.",2415
5523,"Theresponsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, andthat excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to mein some danger of melting his eyes.",2415
5524,"It was no nominal meal that we weregoing to make, but a vigorous reality.",2415
5525,"The Aged prepared such ahay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it asit simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while MissSkiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premisesbecame strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire toparticipate in the entertainment.",2415
5526,"The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the rightmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworthas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep.",2416
5527,"Nothing disturbedthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open ofJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to somespasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until Igot used to it.",2416
5528,"I inferred from the methodical nature of MissSkiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; andI rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing theprofile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a verynew moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her byWemmick.",2416
5529,"We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it wasdelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it.",2417
5530,"The Agedespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savagetribe, just oiled.",2417
5531,"After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in theabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom ofher family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a triflinglady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us.",2417
5532,"Then, she put onher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”",2417
5533,"Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, thatthis was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentlemaninfinite satisfaction to read the news aloud.",2418
5534,"“I won’t offer anapology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—areyou, Aged P.?”",2418
5535,"“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himselfspoken to.",2419
5536,"“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,”said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king.",2420
5537,"We are all attention,Aged One.”",2420
5538,"“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man, so busyand so pleased, that it really was quite charming.",2421
5539,"The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’sgreat-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to comethrough a keyhole.",2422
5540,"As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he wasalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper intothem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill.",2422
5541,"But Wemmick wasequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,quite unconscious of his many rescues.",2422
5542,"Whenever he looked at us, we allexpressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until heresumed again.",2422
5543,"As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in ashadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and graduallystealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist.",2423
5544,"In course of time I sawhis hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that momentMiss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his armagain as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatestdeliberation laid it on the table before her.",2423
5545,"Miss Skiffins’s composurewhile she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have everseen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstractionof mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed itmechanically.",2423
5546,"By and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, andgradually fading out of view.",2424
5547,"Shortly afterwards, his mouth began towiden again.",2424
5548,"After an interval of suspense on my part that was quiteenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other sideof Miss Skiffins.",2424
5549,"Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatnessof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laidit on the table.",2424
5550,"Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I amjustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalledto it by Miss Skiffins.",2424
5551,"At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber.",2425
5552,"This was the timefor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a blackbottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clericaldignitary of a rubicund and social aspect.",2425
5553,"With the aid of theseappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, whowas soon awake again.",2425
5554,"Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she andWemmick drank out of one glass.",2425
5555,"Of course I knew better than to offerto see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I hadbest go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, andhaving passed a pleasant evening.",2425
5556,"Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matterappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he wouldbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it.",2426
5557,"So, I went out toWalworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him byappointment in the City several times, but never held any communicationwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain.",2426
5558,"The upshot was, thatwe found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not longestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wantedcapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want apartner.",2426
5559,"Between him and me, secret articles were signed of whichHerbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred poundsdown, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due atcertain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into myproperty.",2426
5560,Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation.,2426
5561,"Wemmickpervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.",2426
5562,"The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not theleast suspicion of my hand being in it.",2427
5563,"I never shall forget theradiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as amighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (theyoung merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown anextraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that theopening had come at last.",2427
5564,"Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and hisface brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionatefriend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears oftriumph when I saw him so happy.",2427
5565,"At length, the thing being done, andhe having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked tome for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did reallycry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectationshad done some good to somebody.",2427
5566,"A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on myview.",2428
5567,"But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to allthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella.",2428
5568,It is notmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.,2428
5569,Chapter XXXVIII.,2430
5570,"If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come tobe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost.",2431
5571,"Othe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit withinme haunted that house when Estella lived there!",2431
5572,"Let my body be where itwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about thathouse.",2431
5573,"The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was awidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella.",2432
5574,"The motherlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion waspink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,and the daughter for theology.",2432
5575,"They were in what is called a goodposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people.",2432
5576,"Little,if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, butthe understanding was established that they were necessary to her, andthat she was necessary to them.",2432
5577,Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of MissHavisham’s before the time of her seclusion.,2432
5578,"In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I sufferedevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me.",2433
5579,"Thenature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms offamiliarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to mydistraction.",2433
5580,"She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turnedthe very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting aconstant slight on my devotion to her.",2433
5581,"If I had been her secretary,steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brotherof her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself furtherfrom my hopes when I was nearest to her.",2433
5582,"The privilege of calling herby her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under thecircumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likelythat it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that italmost maddened me.",2433
5583,She had admirers without end.,2434
5584,No doubt my jealousy made an admirer ofevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of themwithout that.,2434
5585,"I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I usedoften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me.",2435
5586,"I neverhad one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round thefour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her withme unto death.",2435
5587,"Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as willpresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habituallyreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forcedupon us.",2436
5588,"There were other times when she would come to a sudden checkin this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.",2436
5589,"“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we satapart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you nevertake warning?”",2437
5590,“Of what?”,2438
5591,“Of me.”,2439
5592,"“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”",2440
5593,“Do I mean!,2441
5594,"If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”",2441
5595,"I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for thereason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of mymiseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham.",2442
5596,"Mydread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavydisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebelliousstruggle in her bosom.",2442
5597,"“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for youwrote to me to come to you, this time.”",2443
5598,"“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that alwayschilled me.",2444
5599,"After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went onto say:—",2445
5600,“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a dayat Satis.,2446
5601,"You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will.",2446
5602,"Shewould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people.",2446
5603,Canyou take me?”,2446
5604,"“Can I take you, Estella!”",2447
5605,“You can then?,2448
5606,"The day after to-morrow, if you please.",2448
5607,You are to payall charges out of my purse.,2448
5608,You hear the condition of your going?”,2448
5609,"“And must obey,” said I.",2449
5610,"This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for otherslike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much asseen her handwriting.",2450
5611,"We went down on the next day but one, and wefound her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needlessto add that there was no change in Satis House.",2450
5612,"She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when Ilast saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there wassomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.",2451
5613,"She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon hergestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she lookedat her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she hadreared.",2451
5614,"From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed topry into my heart and probe its wounds.",2452
5615,"“How does she use you, Pip; howdoes she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,even in Estella’s hearing.",2452
5616,"But, when we sat by her flickering fire atnight, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawnthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, bydint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regularletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mindmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutchstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, avery spectre.",2452
5617,"I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense ofdependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this thatEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that shewas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term.",2453
5618,"I sawin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me.",2453
5619,"Sending herout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her withthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose.",2453
5620,"I saw inthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, evenwhile the prize was reserved for me.",2453
5621,I saw in this the reason for mybeing staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’sdeclining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.,2453
5622,"In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and therebefore my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw inthis, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in whichher life was hidden from the sun.",2453
5623,The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces onthe wall.,2454
5624,"They were high from the ground, and they burnt with thesteady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed.",2454
5625,"As Ilooked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at thestopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon thetable and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostlyreflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, Isaw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeatedand thrown back to me.",2454
5626,"My thoughts passed into the great room acrossthe landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as itwere, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in thecrawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice asthey betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in thegropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.",2454
5627,It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arosebetween Estella and Miss Havisham.,2455
5628,It was the first time I had everseen them opposed.,2455
5629,"We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havishamstill had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutchedEstella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.",2456
5630,"She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had ratherendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.",2456
5631,"“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tiredof me?”",2457
5632,"“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her arm,and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down atthe fire.",2458
5633,"“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionatelystriking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”",2459
5634,"Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down atthe fire.",2460
5635,"Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed aself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that wasalmost cruel.",2460
5636,“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham.,2461
5637,"“You cold, cold heart!”",2461
5638,"“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as sheleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “doyou reproach me for being cold?",2462
5639,You?”,2462
5640,“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.,2463
5641,"“You should know,” said Estella.",2464
5642,“I am what you have made me.,2464
5643,"Take allthe praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all thefailure; in short, take me.”",2464
5644,"“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look ather so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared!",2465
5645,"Where Itook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from itsstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!”",2465
5647,"“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I couldwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do.",2467
5648,Butwhat would you have?,2467
5649,"You have been very good to me, and I oweeverything to you.",2467
5650,What would you have?”,2467
5651,"“Love,” replied the other.",2468
5652,“You have it.”,2469
5653,"“I have not,” said Miss Havisham.",2470
5654,"“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the easygrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, neveryielding either to anger or tenderness,—“mother by adoption, I havesaid that I owe everything to you.",2471
5655,All I possess is freely yours.,2471
5656,"Allthat you have given me, is at your command to have again.",2471
5657,"Beyond that,I have nothing.",2471
5658,"And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”",2471
5659,"“Did I never give her love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.",2472
5660,"“Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at alltimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me!",2472
5661,"Let her callme mad, let her call me mad!”",2472
5662,"“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people?",2473
5663,"Doesany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as Ido?",2473
5664,"Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half aswell as I do?",2473
5665,"I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stoolthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking upinto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”",2473
5666,“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham.,2474
5667,“Times soon forgotten!”,2474
5668,"“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella,—“not forgotten, but treasured upin my memory.",2475
5669,When have you found me false to your teaching?,2475
5670,When haveyou found me unmindful of your lessons?,2475
5671,"When have you found me givingadmission here,” she touched her bosom with her hand, “to anything thatyou excluded?",2475
5672,Be just to me.”,2475
5673,"“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hairwith both her hands.",2476
5674,“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella.,2477
5675,“Who praised me when Ilearnt my lesson?”,2477
5676,"“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.",2478
5677,“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella.,2479
5678,“Who praised me when Ilearnt my lesson?”,2479
5679,"“But to be proud and hard to _me_!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, asshe stretched out her arms.",2480
5680,"“Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud andhard to _me_!”",2480
5681,"Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but wasnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down atthe fire again.",2481
5682,"“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence “whyyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after aseparation.",2482
5683,I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes.,2482
5684,I havenever been unfaithful to you or your schooling.,2482
5685,I have never shown anyweakness that I can charge myself with.”,2482
5686,“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham.,2483
5687,"“Butyes, yes, she would call it so!”",2483
5688,"“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another momentof calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about.",2484
5689,"If youhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement ofthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing asthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,—if you haddone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand thedaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed andangry?”",2484
5690,"Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.",2485
5691,"“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be herenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it hadblighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and shecould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”",2486
5692,"Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see herface), but still made no answer.",2487
5693,"“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made.",2488
5694,"The successis not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”",2488
5695,"Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn.",2489
5696,"I tookadvantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave theroom, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement ofmy hand.",2489
5697,"When I left, Estella was yet standing by the greatchimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout.",2489
5698,"Miss Havisham’s greyhair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, andwas a miserable sight to see.",2489
5699,"It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for anhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and aboutthe ruined garden.",2490
5700,"When I at last took courage to return to the room, Ifound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitchesin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, andof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of oldbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals.",2490
5701,"Afterwards, Estellaand I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and playedFrench games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.",2490
5702,I lay in that separate building across the courtyard.,2491
5703,"It was the firsttime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused tocome near me.",2491
5704,A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me.,2491
5705,"She was on thisside of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behindthe half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in theroom overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere.",2491
5706,"At last, when the nightwas slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutelycould no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that Imust get up.",2491
5707,"I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went outacross the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain theouter courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind.",2491
5708,"But I was nosooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw MissHavisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry.",2491
5709,"Ifollowed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase.",2491
5710,"Shecarried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken fromone of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object byits light.",2491
5711,"Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewedair of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heardher walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across againinto that, never ceasing the low cry.",2491
5712,"After a time, I tried in the darkboth to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until somestreaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands.",2491
5713,"Duringthe whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, Iheard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaselesslow cry.",2491
5714,"Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference betweenher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; andthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance.",2492
5715,"Nor,did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, exceptthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its formercharacteristics.",2492
5716,"It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting BentleyDrummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.",2493
5717,"On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, andwhen good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’sagreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove toorder, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’sturn to do that day.",2494
5718,"I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at mewhile the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lostbetween us, that might easily be.",2494
5719,What was my indignant surprise whenhe called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”,2494
5720,“Estella who?” said I.,2495
5721,"“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.",2496
5722,“Estella of where?” said I.,2497
5723,"“You are bound to say of where.” Which hewas, as a Finch.",2497
5724,"“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question,“and a peerless beauty.”",2498
5725,"Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot!",2499
5726,Iwhispered Herbert.,2499
5727,"“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast hadbeen honoured.",2500
5728,“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.,2501
5729,"“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.",2502
5730,“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.,2503
5731,"“_O_, Lord!”",2503
5732,"This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavycreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by itas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my placeand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourableFinch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked aboutcoming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn ofexpression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knewnothing.",2504
5733,"Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant bythat?",2504
5734,Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knewwhere I was to be found.,2504
5735,"Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided.",2505
5736,"Thedebate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six morehonourable members told six more, during the discussion, that theybelieved _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found.",2505
5737,"However, it wasdecided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummlewould bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing thathe had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmthwhich.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honourshould take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with apolite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour ofdancing with him several times.",2505
5738,"This left me no course but to regretthat I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole torepudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.",2505
5739,"Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while theGrove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally thepromotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazingrate.",2505
5740,"I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.",2506
5741,"For, I cannotadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella shouldshow any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very farbelow the average.",2506
5742,"To the present moment, I believe it to have beenreferable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in mylove for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping tothat hound.",2506
5743,No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she hadfavoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kindand degree of distress.,2506
5744,"It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummlehad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it.",2507
5745,"Alittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossedone another every day.",2507
5746,"He held on, in a dull persistent way, andEstella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing himvery well, now scarcely remembering who he was.",2507
5747,"The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,however, and had the patience of his tribe.",2508
5748,"Added to that, he had ablockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, whichsometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place ofconcentration and determined purpose.",2508
5749,"So, the Spider, doggedly watchingEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoilhimself and drop at the right nick of time.",2508
5750,"At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Ballsat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much tolerationon her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him.",2509
5751,"I took thenext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley totake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.",2509
5752,"Iwas with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from suchplaces.",2509
5753,"“Are you tired, Estella?”",2510
5754,"“Rather, Pip.”",2511
5755,“You should be.”,2512
5756,"“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House towrite, before I go to sleep.”",2513
5757,“Recounting to-night’s triumph?” said I.,2514
5758,"“Surely a very poor one,Estella.”",2514
5759,“What do you mean?,2515
5760,I didn’t know there had been any.”,2515
5761,"“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who islooking over here at us.”",2516
5762,"“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on meinstead.",2517
5763,"“What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to useyour words,—that I need look at?”",2517
5764,"“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I.",2518
5765,“For hehas been hovering about you all night.”,2518
5766,"“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with aglance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle.",2519
5767,Can the candle helpit?”,2519
5768,"“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”",2520
5769,"“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps.",2521
5770,Yes.,2521
5771,Anything youlike.”,2521
5772,"“But, Estella, do hear me speak.",2522
5773,It makes me wretched that you shouldencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle.,2522
5774,You know he isdespised.”,2522
5775,“Well?” said she.,2523
5776,“You know he is as ungainly within as without.,2524
5777,"A deficient,ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”",2524
5778,“Well?” said she.,2525
5779,"“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculousroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”",2526
5780,"“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened herlovely eyes the wider.",2527
5781,"To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took itfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well!",2528
5782,"Then, that iswhy it makes me wretched.”",2528
5783,"Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any ideaof making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of thequestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.",2529
5784,"“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t befoolish about its effect on you.",2530
5785,"It may have its effect on others, andmay be meant to have.",2530
5786,It’s not worth discussing.”,2530
5787,"“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say,‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowestin the crowd.’”",2531
5788,"“I can bear it,” said Estella.",2532
5789,“Oh!,2533
5790,"don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”",2533
5791,"“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, openingher hands.",2534

5852,"I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented thesort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.",2563
5853,"I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me torespond to it.",2563
5854,"But I took him into the room I had just left, and,having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could toexplain himself.",2563
5855,"He looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wonderingpleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and hepulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat.",2564

5857,"But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him.",2564
5858,"On thecontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his handsto me.",2564

5868,"“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with adeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and mostexasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one!",2570

5874,"No need to take a file from his pocket and show it tome; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it roundhis head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take ashivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition.",2571

5900,There was a tray ready on a side-table.,2580
5901,"I brought it to the table nearthe fire, and asked him what he would have?",2580
5902,"He touched one of thebottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rumand water.",2580
5903,"I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his lookat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of hisneckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand verydifficult to master.",2580
5904,"When at last I put the glass to him, I saw withamazement that his eyes were full of tears.",2580
5905,"Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wishedhim gone.",2581
5906,"But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, andfelt a touch of reproach.",2581
5907,"“I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting somethinginto a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that youwill not think I spoke harshly to you just now.",2581
5908,"I had no intention ofdoing it, and I am sorry for it if I did.",2581
5909,I wish you well and happy!”,2581

5911,"I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drewhis sleeve across his eyes and forehead.",2582
5912,“How are you living?” I asked him.,2583
5913,"“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away inthe new world,” said he; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off fromthis.”",2584
5914,“I hope you have done well?”,2585
5915,“I’ve done wonderfully well.,2586

5919,"“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”",2588
5920,"Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in whichthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into mymind.",2589
5921,"“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,“since he undertook that trust?”",2590

5926,"But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me paythem back.",2592
5927,You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.” I took outmy purse.,2592

5929,"Theywere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.",2593
5930,"Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded themlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and droppedthe ashes into the tray.",2593
5931,"“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you _how_ you have donewell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”",2594
5932,“How?”,2595
5933,“Ah!”,2596

5958,"Why, Wemmick.”",2607
5959,"I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.",2608
5960,"Istood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where Iseemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until Igrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn.",2608
5961,"He caughtme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent onone knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, andthat I shuddered at, very near to mine.",2608

6070,Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seenhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I hadheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him;that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wildbeast.,2645
6071,Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire ahalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there withhim in the dead of the wild solitary night.,2645

6087,"Not stumbling on the means after all,I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman thereto come with his lantern.",2652
6088,"Now, in groping my way down the blackstaircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouchingin a corner.",2652
6089,"As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, buteluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchmanto come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back.",2653

6092,"All was quiet, andassuredly no other man was in those chambers.",2653
6093,"It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, onthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on thechance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram atthe door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who hadperceptibly been dining out?",2654
6094,"Yes, he said; at different times of thenight, three.",2654

6112,"Whereas they were easy of innocentsolution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, whohad not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to mystaircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might havebrought some one with him to show him the way,—still, joined, they hadan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of afew hours had made me.",2664

6151,"“Not over and above, dear boy.",2689
6152,I was in the provinces mostly.”,2689

6160,"He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all hisactions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy.",2695
6161,"Some of his teeth had failedhim since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food inhis mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs tobear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog.",2695

6168,"Havingfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if hispocket were a drawer.",2697

6258,"There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in EssexStreet, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost withinhail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was sofortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis.",2724
6259,"Ithen went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary tothe change in his appearance.",2724
6260,"This business transacted, I turned myface, on my own account, to Little Britain.",2724
6261,"Mr. Jaggers was at hisdesk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before hisfire.",2724
6262,"“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”",2725
6263,"“I will, sir,” I returned.",2726
6264,"For, coming along I had thought well of whatI was going to say.",2726
6265,"“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.",2727
6266,You understand—any one.,2727
6267,Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to knowanything; I am not curious.”,2727
6268,Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.,2728
6269,"“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what Ihave been told is true.",2729
6270,"I have no hope of its being untrue, but atleast I may verify it.”",2729
6271,Mr. Jaggers nodded.,2730
6272,"“But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he askedme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in alistening way at the floor.",2730
6273,“Told would seem to imply verbalcommunication.,2730
6274,"You can’t have verbal communication with a man in NewSouth Wales, you know.”",2730
6275,"“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”",2731
6276,“Good.”,2732
6277,"“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is thebenefactor so long unknown to me.”",2733
6278,"“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”",2734
6279,“And only he?” said I.,2735
6280,"“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.",2736
6281,"“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible formy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was MissHavisham.”",2737
6282,"“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon mecoolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at allresponsible for that.”",2738
6283,"“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.",2739
6284,"“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his headand gathering up his skirts.",2740
6285,“Take nothing on its looks; takeeverything on evidence.,2740
6286,There’s no better rule.”,2740
6287,"“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent fora little while.",2741
6288,"“I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”",2741
6289,"“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,”said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout mycommunication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line offact.",2742
6290,There has never been the least departure from the strict line offact.,2742
6291,You are quite aware of that?”,2742
6292,"“Quite, sir.”",2743
6293,“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote tome—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever todeviate from the strict line of fact.,2744
6294,I also communicated to himanother caution.,2744
6295,He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in hisletter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here.,2744
6296,"Icautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at alllikely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of hisnatural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would bean act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of thelaw.",2744
6297,"I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard atme; “I wrote it to New South Wales.",2744
6298,"He guided himself by it, no doubt.”",2744
6299,"“No doubt,” said I.",2745
6300,"“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still lookinghard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, froma colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”",2746
6301,"“Or Provis,” I suggested.",2747
6302,"“Or Provis—thank you, Pip.",2748
6303,Perhaps it _is_ Provis?,2748
6304,Perhaps you knowit’s Provis?”,2748
6305,"“Yes,” said I.",2749
6306,“You know it’s Provis.,2750
6307,"A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonistof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, onbehalf of Magwitch.",2750
6308,"Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, byreturn of post.",2750
6309,Probably it is through Provis that you have receivedthe explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”,2750
6310,"“It came through Provis,” I replied.",2751
6311,"“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to haveseen you.",2752
6312,"In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or incommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mentionthat the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent toyou, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.",2752
6313,"Good-day, Pip!”",2752
6314,"We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me.",2753
6315,"Iturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the twovile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”",2753
6316,"Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have donenothing for me.",2754
6317,"I went straight back to the Temple, where I found theterrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, insafety.",2754
6318,"Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.",2755
6319,"Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) thanwhat he had worn before.",2755
6320,"To my thinking, there was something in himthat made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him.",2755
6321,"The more I dressedhim and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouchingfugitive on the marshes.",2755
6322,"This effect on my anxious fancy was partlyreferable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiarto me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if therewere still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there wasConvict in the very grain of the man.",2755
6323,"The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gavehim a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were theinfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now.",2756
6324,"In all his waysof sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about ina high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handledjackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of liftinglight glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsypannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with itthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to makethe most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, andthen swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small namelessinstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,Bondsman, plain as plain could be.",2756
6325,"It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I hadconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts.",2757
6326,"But I can compare theeffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge uponthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that itwas most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer ofpretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head.",2757
6327,"Itwas abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cutshort.",2757
6328,"Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadfulmystery that he was to me.",2758
6329,"When he fell asleep of an evening, with hisknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald headtattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sitand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with allthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me tostart up and fly from him.",2758
6330,"Every hour so increased my abhorrence ofhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in thefirst agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done forme and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must sooncome back.",2758
6331,"Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, andbegin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leavehim there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as aprivate soldier.",2758
6332,"I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in thoselonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind andthe rain always rushing by.",2759
6333,"A ghost could not have been taken andhanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and thedread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors.",2759
6334,"When hewas not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a raggedpack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, andin which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into thetable,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he wouldask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the firesurveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, betweenthe fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumbshow to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency.",2759
6335,"The imaginarystudent pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, wasnot more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, andrecoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired meand the fonder he was of me.",2759
6336,"This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year.",2760
6337,Itlasted about five days.,2760
6338,"Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not goout, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark.",2760
6339,"At length, oneevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quiteworn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearfuldreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase.",2760
6340,"Provis,who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in aninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.",2760
6341,“Quiet!,2761
6342,"It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with theairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.",2761
6343,"“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and againhow are you?",2762
6344,I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!,2762

6346,"Handel, my—Halloa!",2762
6347,Ibeg your pardon.”,2762
6348,"He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, byseeing Provis.",2763
6349,"Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowlyputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for somethingelse.",2763
6350,"“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, whileHerbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange hashappened.",2764
6351,This is—a visitor of mine.”,2764

6355,Kiss it!”,2765

6357,"So, Herbert, looking at mewith a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provisimmediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, youknow.",2766

6361,"Enough, that I saw my own feelingsreflected in Herbert’s face, and not least among them, my repugnancetowards the man who had done so much for me.",2769
6362,"What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if therehad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.",2770
6363,"Saving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion sincehis return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, themoment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of thepossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune.",2770
6364,"His boastthat he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me supportthe character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much asfor himself.",2770
6365,"And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quiteestablished in his own mind.",2770
6366,"“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after havingdiscoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I comeback—for half a minute—I’ve been low.",2771
6367,"I said to Pip, I knowed as I hadbeen low.",2771
6368,But don’t you fret yourself on that score.,2771

6371,"Muzzled I havebeen since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzledI am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”",2771
6372,"Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specificconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed.",2772
6373,"We wereanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave ustogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and satlate.",2772
6374,"It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and sawhim safely in at his own dark door.",2772
6375,"When it closed upon him, Iexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night ofhis arrival.",2772
6376,"Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, Ihad always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and inbringing him back; and I looked about me now.",2773
6377,"Difficult as it is in alarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind isconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself thatany of the people within sight cared about my movements.",2773
6378,"The few whowere passing passed on their several ways, and the street was emptywhen I turned back into the Temple.",2773
6379,"Nobody had come out at the gatewith us, nobody went in at the gate with me.",2773
6380,"As I crossed by thefountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where Ilived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still andlifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.",2773
6381,"Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before soblessedly what it is to have a friend.",2774
6382,"When he had spoken some soundwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider thequestion, What was to be done?",2774
6383,"The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it hadstood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, inone unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances withhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say hischair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, butnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another.",2775
6384,"He hadno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for mypatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own.",2775
6385,We interchanged thatconfidence without shaping a syllable.,2775
6386,"“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—“what isto be done?”",2776
6387,"“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunnedto think.”",2777
6388,"“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell.",2778
6389,"Still, something must bedone.",2778
6390,"He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,and lavish appearances of all kinds.",2778
6391,He must be stopped somehow.”,2778
6392,“You mean that you can’t accept—”,2779
6393,"“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused.",2780
6394,“Think of him!,2780
6395,Look athim!”,2780
6396,An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.,2781
6397,"“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached tome, strongly attached to me.",2782
6398,Was there ever such a fate!”,2782
6399,"“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.",2783
6400,"“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking anotherpenny from him, think what I owe him already!",2784
6401,"Then again: I am heavilyin debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I havebeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”",2784
6402,"“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated.",2785
6403,“Don’t say fit for nothing.”,2785
6404,“What am I fit for?,2786
6405,"I know only one thing that I am fit for, and thatis, to go for a soldier.",2786
6406,"And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, butfor the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”",2786
6407,"Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing awarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.",2787
6408,"“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do.",2788
6409,"Ifyou were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose youwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you havealready had.",2788
6410,"Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!",2788
6411,"Besides, it’s absurd.",2788
6412,"You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’shouse, small as it is.",2788
6413,"I am working up towards a partnership, youknow.”",2788
6414,Poor fellow!,2789
6415,He little suspected with whose money.,2789
6416,"“But there is another question,” said Herbert.",2790
6417,"“This is an ignorant,determined man, who has long had one fixed idea.",2790
6418,"More than that, heseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fiercecharacter.”",2790
6419,"“I know he is,” I returned.",2791
6420,"“Let me tell you what evidence I have seenof it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, ofthat encounter with the other convict.",2791
6421,"“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this!",2792
6422,"He comes here at the perilof his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea.",2792
6423,"In the moment ofrealisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground fromunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.",2792
6424,"Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”",2792
6425,"“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal nightof his arrival.",2793
6426,Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as hisputting himself in the way of being taken.”,2793
6427,"“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be greatdanger of his doing it.",2794
6428,"That is his power over you as long as heremains in England, and that would be his reckless course if youforsook him.”",2794
6429,"I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon mefrom the first, and the working out of which would make me regardmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in mychair, but began pacing to and fro.",2795
6430,"I said to Herbert, meanwhile, thateven if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I shouldbe wretched as the cause, however innocently.",2795
6431,"Yes; even though I was sowretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I wouldfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than Iwould ever have come to this!",2795
6432,"But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?",2796
6433,"“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get himout of England.",2797
6434,"You will have to go with him, and then he may beinduced to go.”",2797
6435,"“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”",2798
6436,"“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the nextstreet, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind tohim and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere?",2799
6437,"If a pretext to gethim away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anythingelse in his life, now.”",2799
6438,"“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open handsheld out, as if they contained the desperation of the case.",2800
6439,“I knownothing of his life.,2800
6440,"It has almost made me mad to sit here of a nightand see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrifiedme two days in my childhood!”",2800
6441,"Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to andfro together, studying the carpet.",2801
6442,"“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can takeno further benefits from him; do you?”",2802
6443,“Fully.,2803
6444,"Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”",2803
6445,“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”,2804
6446,"“Herbert, can you ask me?”",2805
6447,"“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life hehas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, fromthrowing it away.",2806
6448,Then you must get him out of England before you stira finger to extricate yourself.,2806
6449,"That done, extricate yourself, inHeaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”",2806
6450,"It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,with only that done.",2807
6451,"“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge ofhis history.",2808
6452,There is but one way that I know of.,2808
6453,I must ask him pointblank.”,2808
6454,“Yes.,2809
6455,"Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in themorning.” For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he wouldcome to breakfast with us.",2809
6456,"With this project formed, we went to bed.",2810
6457,"I had the wildest dreamsconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fearwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returnedtransport.",2810
6458,"Waking, I never lost that fear.",2810
6459,"He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and satdown to his meal.",2811

6461,"He considered thechambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me tolook out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which hecould have “a shake-down.” When he had made an end of his breakfast,and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word ofpreface,—",2811

6463,Youremember?”,2812

6657,"Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I setoff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out onthe open country road when the day came creeping on, halting andwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags ofmist, like a beggar.",2879

6666,“Is this a cut?” said Mr. Drummle.,2882
6667,"“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it?",2883
6668,How do you do?,2883
6669,"I waswondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”",2883
6670,"With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myselfside by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to thefire.",2884
6671,"“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little awaywith his shoulder.",2885
6672,"“Yes,” said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.",2886

6679,"“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch ofthe fire.",2891
6680,"“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,but equally determined.",2892
6681,“Do you stay here long?”,2893

6683,“Do you?”,2894

6685,"I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’sshoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should havejerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urgeda similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.",2896
6686,He whistled a little.,2896

6707,"“Very good, sir.”",2908
6708,"Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on hisgreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and soexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as therobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seathim on the fire.",2909
6709,"One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until reliefcame, neither of us could relinquish the fire.",2910

6711,"The horse was visible outside inthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’swas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we bothstood our ground.",2910
6712,“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.,2911
6713,"“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I wasthere.”",2912
6714,“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”,2913
6715,"“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.",2914
6716,"“Come, come!",2915
6717,"They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle.",2915
6718,“Youshouldn’t have lost your temper.”,2915
6719,“Mr.,2916
6720,"Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on thatsubject.",2916
6721,"When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on thatoccasion), I don’t throw glasses.”",2916
6722,"“I do,” said Drummle.",2917
6723,"After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state ofsmouldering ferocity, I said,—",2918
6724,“Mr.,2919
6725,"Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it anagreeable one.”",2919
6726,"“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “Idon’t think anything about it.”",2920
6727,"“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that wehold no kind of communication in future.”",2921
6728,"“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggestedmyself, or done—more likely—without suggesting.",2922
6729,But don’t lose yourtemper.,2922
6730,Haven’t you lost enough without that?”,2922
6731,"“What do you mean, sir?”",2923
6732,"“Waiter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.",2924
6733,The waiter reappeared.,2925
6734,"“Look here, you sir.",2926
6735,"You quite understand that the young lady don’tride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”",2926
6736,"“Quite so, sir!”",2927
6737,"When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of hishand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocketand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring.",2928
6738,"Choking andboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, withoutintroducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there wereno one present, and forced myself to silence.",2928
6739,"How long we might haveremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but forthe incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, Ithink—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats andrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, wewere obliged to give way.",2928
6740,"I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting inhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away.",2929
6741,"I thoughthe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar inhis mouth, which he had forgotten.",2929
6742,"A man in a dust-coloured dressappeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummleleaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with ajerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouchingshoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards mereminded me of Orlick.",2929
6743,"Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he orno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and thejourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old housethat it would have been so much the better for me never to haveentered, never to have seen.",2930
6744,Chapter XLIV.,2932
6745,"In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candlesburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havishamseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.",2933
6746,"Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on.",2933
6747,"They bothraised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me.",2933
6748,"Iderived that, from the look they interchanged.",2933
6749,"“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”",2934
6750,"Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.",2935
6751,"Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, andthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, asplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceivedI had discovered my real benefactor.",2935
6752,"“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak toEstella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.”",2936
6753,"Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen heroccupy.",2937
6754,"With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a naturalplace for me, that day.",2937
6755,"“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,presently—in a few moments.",2938
6756,"It will not surprise you, it will notdisplease you.",2938
6757,I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”,2938
6758,Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me.,2939
6759,I could see in theaction of Estella’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what Isaid; but she did not look up.,2939
6760,“I have found out who my patron is.,2940
6761,"It is not a fortunate discovery,and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,anything.",2940
6762,There are reasons why I must say no more of that.,2940
6763,"It is notmy secret, but another’s.”",2940
6764,"As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how togo on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.",2941
6765,Well?”,2941
6766,"“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when Ibelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, Isuppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might havecome,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paidfor it?”",2942
6767,"“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”",2943
6768,“And that Mr. Jaggers—”,2944
6769,“Mr.,2945
6770,"Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “hadnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it.",2945
6771,"His being my lawyer, andhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence.",2945
6772,"He holds the samerelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise.",2945
6773,"Be thatas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”",2945
6774,Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was nosuppression or evasion so far.,2946
6775,"“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at leastyou led me on?” said I.",2947
6776,"“Yes,” she returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”",2948
6777,“Was that kind?”,2949
6778,"“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor andflashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her insurprise,—“who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”",2950
6779,"It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it.",2951
6780,"Itold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.",2951
6781,"“Well, well, well!” she said.",2952
6782,“What else?”,2952
6783,"“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to sootheher, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only formy own information.",2953
6784,What follows has another (and I hope moredisinterested) purpose.,2953
6785,"In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, youpunished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expressesyour intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”",2953
6786,“I did.,2954
6787,"Why, they would have it so!",2954
6788,So would you.,2954

6790,You made your own snares.,2954
6791,_I_ never made them.”,2954
6792,"Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her ina wild and sudden way,—I went on.",2955
6793,"“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,and have been constantly among them since I went to London.",2956
6794,I know themto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself.,2956
6795,"And I should befalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to youor no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, thatyou deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if yousuppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, andincapable of anything designing or mean.”",2956
6796,"“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.",2957
6797,"“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me tohave superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, andMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.”",2958
6798,"This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to dothem good with her.",2959
6799,"She looked at me keenly for a little while, andthen said quietly,—",2959
6800,“What do you want for them?”,2960
6801,"“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others.",2961
6802,"Theymay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the samenature.”",2961
6803,"Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—",2962
6804,“What do you want for them?”,2963
6805,"“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that Ireddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,that I do want something.",2964
6806,"Miss Havisham, if you would spare the moneyto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from thenature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show youhow.”",2964
6807,"“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling herhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.",2965
6808,"“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two yearsago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed.",2966
6809,"Why I failin my ability to finish it, I cannot explain.",2966
6810,It is a part of thesecret which is another person’s and not mine.”,2966
6811,"She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.",2967
6812,"After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light ofthe slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by thecollapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—atfirst, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention.",2967
6813,Allthis time Estella knitted on.,2967
6814,"When Miss Havisham had fixed herattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse inour dialogue,—",2967
6815,“What else?”,2968
6816,"“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command mytrembling voice, “you know I love you.",2969
6817,You know that I have loved youlong and dearly.”,2969
6818,"She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and herfingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmovedcountenance.",2970
6819,"I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and fromher to me.",2970
6820,"“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake.",2971
6821,It induced meto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another.,2971
6822,"While I thoughtyou could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.",2971
6823,But I must say it now.”,2971
6824,"Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,Estella shook her head.",2972
6825,"“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know.",2973
6826,"I have no hopethat I shall ever call you mine, Estella.",2973
6827,"I am ignorant what may becomeof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go.",2973
6828,"Still, I loveyou.",2973

6830,"Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shookher head again.",2974
6831,"“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practiseon the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through allthese years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflectedon the gravity of what she did.",2975
6832,But I think she did not.,2975
6833,"I think that,in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”",2975
6834,"I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as shesat looking by turns at Estella and at me.",2976
6835,"“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,fancies,—I don’t know how to call them,—which I am not able tocomprehend.",2977
6836,"When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a formof words; but nothing more.",2977
6837,"You address nothing in my breast, you touchnothing there.",2977
6838,I don’t care for what you say at all.,2977
6839,"I have tried towarn you of this; now, have I not?”",2977
6840,"I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”",2978
6841,“Yes.,2979
6842,"But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.",2979
6843,"Now, did you not think so?”",2979
6844,“I thought and hoped you could not mean it.,2980
6845,"You, so young, untried, andbeautiful, Estella!",2980
6846,Surely it is not in Nature.”,2980
6847,"“It is in _my_ nature,” she returned.",2981
6848,"And then she added, with a stressupon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me.",2981

6853,"“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines withyou this very day?”",2984
6854,"She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,“Quite true.”",2985

6856,"Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,“What have I told you?",2987
6857,"Do you still think, in spite of it, that I donot mean what I say?”",2987
6858,"“You would never marry him, Estella?”",2988
6859,"She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with herwork in her hands.",2989
6860,"Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth?",2989
6861,I amgoing to be married to him.”,2989
6862,"I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself betterthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hearher say those words.",2990
6863,"When I raised my face again, there was such aghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in mypassionate hurry and grief.",2990
6864,"“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into thisfatal step.",2991
6865,"Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—butbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle.",2991
6866,"Miss Havishamgives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be doneto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who trulylove you.",2991
6867,"Among those few there may be one who loves you even asdearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I.",2991
6868,"Take him, and I canbear it better, for your sake!”",2991
6869,"My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would havebeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at allintelligible to her own mind.",2992
6870,"“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married tohim.",2993
6871,"The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall bemarried soon.",2993

6904,"I held her hand to my lips some lingeringmoments, and so I left her.",3003
6905,"But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soonafterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merelywith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her handstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare ofpity and remorse.",3003
6906,"All done, all gone!",3004
6907,"So much was done and gone, that when I went out atthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when Iwent in.",3004
6908,"For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, andthen struck off to walk all the way to London.",3004
6909,"For, I had by that timecome to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to theinn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coachand be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself astire myself out.",3004
6910,It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge.,3005

6913,"As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after theTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take itill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he heldthe gate a little way open for me to pass in.",3006
6914,To help his memory Imentioned my name.,3006

6924,"In those times a bedwas always to be got there at any hour of the night, and thechamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle nextin order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next inorder on his list.",3013
6925,"It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at theback, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddlingover the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into thefireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretchedlittle washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.",3013
6926,"As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of thosevirtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, whichinstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could everbe lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at thebottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made astaringly wide-awake pattern on the walls.",3014
6927,"When I had got into bed, andlay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no moreclose my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.",3014

6929,What a doleful night!,3015
6930,"How anxious, how dismal, how long!",3015
6931,"There was aninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as Ilooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what anumber of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from themarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lyingby for next summer.",3015
6932,"This led me to speculate whether any of them evertumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—adisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionableapproaches up my back.",3015

6934,"The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the littlewashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in thechest of drawers.",3015
6935,"At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquireda new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I sawwritten, DON’T GO HOME.",3015
6936,"Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they neverwarded off this DON’T GO HOME.",3016
6937,"It plaited itself into whatever Ithought of, as a bodily pain would have done.",3016
6938,"Not long before, I hadread in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummumsin the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and hadbeen found in the morning weltering in blood.",3016
6939,"It came into my head thathe must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed toassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the doorto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionshipof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing.",3016
6940,"Butall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, werequestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposedthere could be no more room in it for any other theme.",3016
6941,"Even when Ithought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when Irecalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks andtones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I waspursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.",3016
6942,"When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became avast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate.",3016
6943,"Imperative mood, presenttense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, donot ye or you go home, let not them go home.",3016
6944,"Then potentially: I maynot and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, andshould not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, androlled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon thewall again.",3016
6945,"I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it wasplain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equallyplain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only couldbe taken.",3017
6946,"It was a relief to get out of the room where the night hadbeen so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door tostartle me from my uneasy bed.",3017
6947,The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock.,3018
6948,"The littleservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, Ipassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he wasmaking tea for himself and the Aged.",3018
6949,An open door afforded aperspective view of the Aged in bed.,3018
6950,"“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick.",3019
6951,"“You did come home, then?”",3019
6952,"“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”",3020
6953,"“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands.",3021
6954,"“I left a note for youat each of the Temple gates, on the chance.",3021
6955,Which gate did you cometo?”,3021
6956,I told him.,3022
6957,"“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy thenotes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentaryevidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be putin.",3023
6958,I’m going to take a liberty with you.,3023
6959,_Would_ you mind toastingthis sausage for the Aged P.?”,3023
6960,I said I should be delighted to do it.,3024
6961,"“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick to thelittle servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr. Pip?”he added, winking, as she disappeared.",3025
6962,"I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourseproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and hebuttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll.",3026
6963,"“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand oneanother.",3027
6964,"We are in our private and personal capacities, and we havebeen engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day.",3027
6965,Officialsentiments are one thing.,3027
6966,We are extra official.”,3027
6967,I cordially assented.,3028
6968,"I was so very nervous, that I had already lightedthe Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.",3028
6969,"“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in acertain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it’s aswell not to mention names when avoidable—”",3029
6970,"“Much better not,” said I.",3030
6971,“I understand you.”,3030
6972,"“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that acertain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and notunpossessed of portable property,—I don’t know who it may really be,—wewon’t name this person—”",3031
6973,"“Not necessary,” said I.",3032
6974,"“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a goodmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”",3033
6975,"In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage,and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for whichI apologised.",3034
6976,"“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard ofthereabouts.",3035
6977,"From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raisedand theories formed.",3035
6978,"I also heard that you at your chambers in GardenCourt, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”",3035
6979,“By whom?” said I.,3036
6980,"“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clashwith official responsibilities.",3037
6981,"I heard it, as I have in my time heardother curious things in the same place.",3037
6982,I don’t tell it you oninformation received.,3037
6983,I heard it.”,3037
6984,"He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and setforth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray.",3038
6985,"Previous to placingit before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth,and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up,and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air.",3038
6986,"Thenhe placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “Allright, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “Allright, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacitunderstanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and wastherefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being incomplete ignorance of these proceedings.",3038
6987,"“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason tosuspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable fromthe person to whom you have adverted; is it?”",3039
6988,Wemmick looked very serious.,3040
6989,"“I couldn’t undertake to say that, of myown knowledge.",3040
6990,"I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first.",3040
6991,"Butit either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”",3040
6992,"As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from sayingas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far outof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him.",3041
6993,"But Itold him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like toask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as hedeemed right, and sure that his course would be right.",3041
6994,"He paused in hisbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (hisnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to meonce, to put my question.",3041
6995,"“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name isCompeyson?”",3042
6996,He answered with one other nod.,3043
6997,“Is he living?”,3044
6998,One other nod.,3045
6999,“Is he in London?”,3046
7000,"He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gaveme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.",3047
7001,"“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasised andrepeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what Iheard.",3048
7002,"I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went toClarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”",3048
7003,"“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.",3049
7004,“And him I found.,3050
7005,"Without mentioning any names or going into anydetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediateneighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the waywhile you were out of the way.”",3050
7006,“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”,3051
7007,"“He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him myopinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard toofar out of the way at present.",3052
7008,"Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something.",3052
7009,"Underexisting circumstances, there is no place like a great city when youare once in it.",3052
7010,Don’t break cover too soon.,3052
7011,Lie close.,3052
7012,"Wait till thingsslacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”",3052
7013,"I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert haddone?",3053
7014,“Mr.,3054
7015,"Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half anhour, struck out a plan.",3054
7016,"He mentioned to me as a secret, that he iscourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedriddenPa.",3054
7017,"Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in abow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river.",3054
7018,"Youare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”",3054
7019,"“Not personally,” said I.",3055
7020,"The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companionwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed topresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such verymoderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide thestate of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little timebefore I made her acquaintance.",3056
7021,"When I had begun to advance Herbert’sprospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerfulphilosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally notbeen very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchangedmessages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her.",3056
7022,"However, Idid not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.",3056
7023,"“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by theriver-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, andbeing kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnishedupper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of thatas a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?",3057
7024,"Now, I thought verywell of it, for three reasons I’ll give you.",3057
7025,That is to say: _Firstly_.,3057
7026,"It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usualheap of streets great and small.",3057
7027,_Secondly_.,3057
7028,"Without going near ityourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,through Mr. Herbert.",3057
7029,_Thirdly_.,3057
7030,"After a while and when it might beprudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board aforeign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”",3057
7031,"Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again andagain, and begged him to proceed.",3058
7032,"“Well, sir!",3059
7033,"Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, orRichard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don’t want to know,—quitesuccessfully.",3059
7034,"At the old lodgings it was understood that he wassummoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road andcornered out of it.",3059
7035,"Now, another great advantage of all this is, thatit was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himselfabout your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles offand quite otherwise engaged.",3059
7036,"This diverts suspicion and confuses it;and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back lastnight, you should not go home.",3059
7037,"It brings in more confusion, and youwant confusion.”",3059
7038,"Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, andbegan to get his coat on.",3060
7039,"“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “Ihave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from aWalworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personalcapacity,—I shall be glad to do it.",3061
7040,Here’s the address.,3061
7041,"There can be noharm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all iswell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is anotherreason for your not going home last night.",3061
7042,"But, after you have gonehome, don’t go back here.",3061
7043,"You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip”;his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and letme finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid his handsupon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself ofthis evening to lay hold of his portable property.",3061
7044,You don’t know whatmay happen to him.,3061
7045,Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”,3061
7046,"Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, Iforbore to try.",3062
7047,"“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off.",3063
7048,"If you had nothing morepressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I shouldadvise.",3063
7049,"You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have aperfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he’ll be up presently,—and a littlebit of—you remember the pig?”",3063
7050,"“Of course,” said I.",3064
7051,“Well; and a little bit of _him_.,3065
7052,"That sausage you toasted was his, andhe was in all respects a first-rater.",3065
7053,"Do try him, if it is only for oldacquaintance sake.",3065
7054,"Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.",3065
7055,"“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.",3066
7056,"I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyedone another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.",3067
7057,"We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and Inodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do itdrowsily.",3067
7058,"When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the firefor toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as fromhis glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins wasexpected.",3067
7059,Chapter XLVI.,3069
7060,"Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shoreboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers.",3070
7061,"All that water-sideregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground tome; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wantedwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy tofind.",3070
7062,"It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’s Basin; and I had no otherguide to Chinks’s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.",3070
7063,"It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myselfamong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards ofship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting intothe ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country ofaccumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the OldGreen Copper.",3071
7064,"After several times falling short of my destination andas often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon MillPond Bank.",3071
7065,"It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and therewere two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruinedwindmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long andnarrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of woodenframes set in the ground, that looked like superannuatedhaymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.",3071
7066,"Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with awooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which isanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,Mrs. Whimple.",3072
7067,"That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderlywoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded.",3072
7068,"She wasimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into theparlour and shut the door.",3072
7069,"It was an odd sensation to see his veryfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar roomand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at thecorner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon thechimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representingthe death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King Georgethe Third in a state coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,on the terrace at Windsor.",3072
7070,"“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied, thougheager to see you.",3073
7071,"My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll waittill she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll goupstairs.",3073
7072,_That’s_ her father.”,3073
7073,"I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probablyexpressed the fact in my countenance.",3074
7074,"“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but Ihave never seen him.",3075
7075,Don’t you smell rum?,3075
7076,He is always at it.”,3075
7077,“At rum?” said I.,3076
7078,"“Yes,” returned Herbert, “and you may suppose how mild it makes hisgout.",3077
7079,"He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in hisroom, and serving them out.",3077
7080,"He keeps them on shelves over his head, and_will_ weigh them all.",3077
7081,His room must be like a chandler’s shop.”,3077
7082,"While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, andthen died away.",3078
7083,"“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “ifhe _will_ cut the cheese?",3079
7084,A man with the gout in his right hand—andeverywhere else—can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester withouthurting himself.”,3079
7085,"He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furiousroar.",3080
7086,"“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.Whimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t standthat noise.",3081
7087,"A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”",3081
7088,"It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.",3082
7089,“Mrs.,3083
7090,"Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best ofhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without hermotherly help.",3083

7097,"Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that hefirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education atan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home tonurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to themotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated withequal kindness and discretion, ever since.",3086
7098,"It was understood thatnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, byreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subjectmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser’s stores.",3086
7099,"As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s sustainedgrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room dooropened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so camein with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of thebasket, and presented, blushing, as “Clara.” She really was a mostcharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom thattruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.",3087
7100,"“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionateand tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’ssupper, served out every night.",3088
7101,"Here’s her allowance of bread, andhere’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum,—which I drink.",3088
7102,"This isMr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked.",3088
7103,"Twomutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, twoounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper.",3088
7104,"It’sstewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout,I should think!”",3088
7105,"There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way oflooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; andsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner ofyielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle inher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in thebeam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her andHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.",3089
7106,"I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly thegrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise washeard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore itthrough the ceiling to come at us.",3090
7107,"Upon this Clara said to Herbert,“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.",3090
7108,“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert.,3091

7110,"“I don’t know,” said I.",3092
7111,“Something to drink?”,3092
7112,"“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinarymerit.",3093
7113,“He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.,3093
7114,"Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some.",3093
7115,"There hegoes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end.",3093
7116,"“Now,” saidHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking.",3093
7117,"Now,” saidHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down againon his back!”",3093
7118,"Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs tosee our charge.",3094
7119,"As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarselymuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, thefollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for somethingquite the reverse:—",3094
7120,“Ahoy!,3095
7121,"Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley.",3095
7122,"Here’s old Bill Barley,bless your eyes.",3095
7123,"Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by theLord.",3095
7124,"Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.",3095
7125,Ahoy!,3095
7126,Bless you.”,3095
7127,"In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barleywould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, whileit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope whichwas fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.",3096
7128,"In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh andairy, and in which Mr.",3097
7129,"Barley was less audible than below, I foundProvis comfortably settled.",3097
7130,"He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feelnone that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he wassoftened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could neverafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.",3097
7131,The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection hadresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respectingCompeyson.,3098
7132,"For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man mightotherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his owndestruction.",3098
7133,"Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by hisfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgmentand sources of information?",3098
7134,"“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”",3099
7135,"“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell youwhat caution he gave me and what advice.”",3100
7136,"This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I toldhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers orprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and thatmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keepingclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick hadsaid about getting him abroad.",3101
7137,"I added, that of course, when the timecame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as mightbe safest in Wemmick’s judgment.",3101
7138,"What was to follow that I did nottouch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about itin my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and indeclared peril for my sake.",3101
7139,"As to altering my way of living byenlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettledand difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if itwere no worse?",3101
7140,"He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout.",3102
7141,"Hiscoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be aventure.",3102
7142,"He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he hadvery little fear of his safety with such good help.",3102
7143,"Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said thatsomething had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’ssuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue.",3103
7144,"“We are both goodwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when theright time comes.",3103
7145,"No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and noboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chanceis worth saving.",3103
7146,"Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be agood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river?",3103
7147,"You fall intothat habit, and then who notices or minds?",3103
7148,"Do it twenty or fifty times,and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first orfifty-first.”",3103
7149,"I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it.",3104
7150,"We agreed thatit should be carried into execution, and that Provis should neverrecognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.",3104
7151,"But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that partof his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all wasright.",3104
7152,"Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, andthat I would take half an hour’s start of him.",3105
7153,"“I don’t like to leaveyou here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being saferhere than near me.",3105
7154,Good-bye!”,3105
7155,"“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we maymeet again, and I don’t like good-bye.",3106
7156,Say good-night!”,3106
7157,“Good-night!,3107
7158,"Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the timecomes you may be certain I shall be ready.",3107
7159,"Good-night, good-night!”",3107
7160,"We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we lefthim on the landing outside his door, holding a light over thestair-rail to light us downstairs.",3108
7161,"Looking back at him, I thought ofthe first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, andwhen I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious atparting from him as it was now.",3108
7162,"Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with noappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease.",3109
7163,"When we got to thefoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the nameof Provis.",3109
7164,"He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.Campbell.",3109
7165,"He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell therewas, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt astrong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living asecluded life.",3109
7166,"So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple andClara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.Campbell, but kept it to myself.",3109
7167,"When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and ofthe motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with alittle affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walkhad grown quite a different place.",3110
7168,"Old Barley might be as old as thehills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there wereredeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill itto overflowing.",3110
7169,"And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, andwent home very sadly.",3110
7170,All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them.,3111
7171,"Thewindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were darkand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court.",3111
7172,"I walked past thefountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were betweenme and my rooms, but I was quite alone.",3111
7173,"Herbert, coming to my bedsidewhen he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited andfatigued,—made the same report.",3111
7174,"Opening one of the windows after that,he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was assolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.",3111
7175,Next day I set myself to get the boat.,3112
7176,"It was soon done, and the boatwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach herwithin a minute or two.",3112
7177,"Then, I began to go out as for training andpractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert.",3112
7178,"I was often out incold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had beenout a few times.",3112
7179,"At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as thehours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge.",3112
7180,"It was OldLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide therewas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation.",3112
7181,"ButI knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, andso began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down toErith.",3112
7182,"The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I werepulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw theblind towards the east come down.",3112
7183,"Herbert was rarely there lessfrequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a singleword of intelligence that was at all alarming.",3112
7184,"Still, I knew that therewas cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of beingwatched.",3112
7185,"Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigningpersons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.",3112
7186,"In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was inhiding.",3113
7187,"Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant tostand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towardsClara.",3113
7188,"But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, goingswiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.",3113
7189,Chapter XLVII.,3115
7190,Some weeks passed without bringing any change.,3116
7191,"We waited for Wemmick,and he made no sign.",3116
7192,"If I had never known him out of Little Britain,and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing atthe Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing himas I did.",3116
7193,"My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressedfor money by more than one creditor.",3117
7194,"Even I myself began to know thewant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieveit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash.",3117
7195,ButI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take moremoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts andplans.,3117
7196,"Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whetherit was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited byhis generosity since his revelation of himself.",3117
7197,"As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estellawas married.",3118
7198,"Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but aconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I hadconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of herto me.",3118
7199,"Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe ofhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know?",3118
7200,"Why did youwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your ownlast year, last month, last week?",3118
7201,"It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above arange of mountains, never disappeared from my view.",3119
7202,"Still, no new causefor fear arose.",3119
7203,"Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terrorfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I wouldwith dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should befleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, andmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on.",3119
7204,"Condemned toinaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowedabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.",3119
7205,"There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I couldnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old LondonBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to bebrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs.",3120
7206,"I was not averse to doingthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among thewater-side people there.",3120
7207,From this slight occasion sprang two meetingsthat I have now to tell of.,3120
7208,"One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at thewharf at dusk.",3121
7209,"I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,and had turned with the tide.",3121
7210,"It had been a fine bright day, but hadbecome foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way backamong the shipping, pretty carefully.",3121
7211,"Both in going and returning, Ihad seen the signal in his window, All well.",3121
7212,"As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfortmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection andsolitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I wouldafterwards go to the play.",3122
7213,"The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achievedhis questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it isnowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go.",3122
7214,"I was aware thatMr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on thecontrary, had rather partaken of its decline.",3122
7215,"He had been ominouslyheard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connectionwith a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.",3122
7216,"And Herbert had seenhim as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a redbrick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.",3122
7217,"I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on everyhalf-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of theknives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within theLord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the timein dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast ofdinners.",3123
7218,"By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.",3123
7219,"There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty’s service,—a mostexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite sotight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked allthe little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous andbrave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he wasvery patriotic.",3124
7220,"He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding inthe cloth, and on that property married a young person inbed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population ofPortsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beachto rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill,fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, ordo anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openlystated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposedto two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was soeffectually done (the Swab family having considerable politicalinfluence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and thenit was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a whitehat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with agridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody downfrom behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he hadoverheard.",3124
7221,"This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard ofbefore) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary ofgreat power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were allto go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain downthe Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services.",3124
7222,"Theboatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes onthe Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as YourHonour, solicited permission to take him by the fin.",3124
7223,"Mr. Wopsle,conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved intoa dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from thatcorner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware ofme.",3124
7224,"The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, inthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoriccountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged inthe manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying greatcowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.",3125
7225,"But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account ofthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice ofhis daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in aflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententiousEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in ahigh-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.",3125
7226,"The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talkedat, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of variouscolours, he had a good deal of time on his hands.",3125
7227,"And I observed, withgreat surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if hewere lost in amazement.",3125
7228,"There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in hismind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out.",3126
7229,"I satthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a largewatch-case, and still I could not make it out.",3126
7230,"I was still thinking ofit when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found himwaiting for me near the door.",3126
7231,"“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down thestreet together.",3127
7232,“I saw that you saw me.”,3127
7233,"“Saw you, Mr. Pip!” he returned.",3128
7234,"“Yes, of course I saw you.",3128
7235,But whoelse was there?”,3128
7236,“Who else?”,3129
7237,"“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lostlook again; “and yet I could swear to him.”",3130
7238,"Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.",3131
7239,"“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,”said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be positive;yet I think I should.”",3132
7240,"Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round mewhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.",3133
7241,“Oh!,3134
7242,"He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle.",3134
7243,“He went out before I wentoff.,3134
7244,I saw him go.”,3134
7245,"Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspectedthis poor actor.",3135
7246,I mistrusted a design to entrap me into someadmission.,3135
7247,"Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, butsaid nothing.",3135
7248,"“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I sawthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like aghost.”",3136
7249,"My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speakyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set onto induce me to connect these references with Provis.",3137
7250,"Of course, I wasperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.",3137
7251,"“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do.",3138
7252,But it isso very strange!,3138
7253,You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you.,3138
7254,"Icould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”",3138
7255,“Indeed?” said I.,3139
7256,"“No, indeed.",3140
7257,"Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain ChristmasDay, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and somesoldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”",3140
7258,“I remember it very well.”,3141
7259,"“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and thatwe joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I tookthe lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?”",3142
7260,"“I remember it all very well.” Better than he thought,—except the lastclause.",3143
7261,"“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and thatthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had beenseverely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?”",3144
7262,“I see it all before me.”,3145
7263,"“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular aboutthat,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was anouter ring of dark night all about us?”",3146
7264,"“Yes,” said I.",3147
7265,“I remember all that.”,3147
7266,"“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight.",3148
7267,Isaw him over your shoulder.”,3148
7268,“Steady!” I thought.,3149
7269,"I asked him then, “Which of the two do you supposeyou saw?”",3149
7270,"“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll swear Isaw him!",3150
7271,"The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.”",3150
7272,"“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put onof its being nothing more to me.",3151
7273,“Very curious indeed!”,3151
7274,"I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversationthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’shaving been behind me “like a ghost.” For if he had ever been out of mythoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it wasin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that Ishould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if Ihad shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then hadfound him at my elbow.",3152
7275,"I could not doubt, either, that he was there,because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of dangerthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.",3152
7276,"I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in?",3153
7277,"Hecould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.",3153
7278,"It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began toidentify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time.",3153
7279,Howwas he dressed?,3153
7280,"Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,in black.",3153
7281,Was his face at all disfigured?,3153
7282,"No, he believed not.",3153
7283,"Ibelieved not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken noespecial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that aface at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.",3153
7284,"When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or Iextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriaterefreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted.",3154
7285,"It wasbetween twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gateswere shut.",3154
7286,No one was near me when I went in and went home.,3154
7287,"Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.",3155
7288,"But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick whatI had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for hishint.",3155
7289,"As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often tothe Castle, I made this communication by letter.",3155
7290,"I wrote it before Iwent to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.",3155
7291,Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be verycautious.,3155
7292,"And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before,if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks’sBasin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bankas I looked at anything else.",3155
7293,Chapter XLVIII.,3157
7294,The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurredabout a week after the first.,3158
7295,"I had again left my boat at the wharfbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and wasstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busyconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some oneovertaking me.",3158
7296,"It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through myarm.",3158
7297,"“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.",3159
7298,Where are you bound for?”,3159
7299,"“For the Temple, I think,” said I.",3160
7300,“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3161
7301,"“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him incross-examination, “I do _not_ know, for I have not made up my mind.”",3162
7302,“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3163
7303,"“You don’t mind admittingthat, I suppose?”",3163
7304,"“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”",3164
7305,“And are not engaged?”,3165
7306,“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”,3166
7307,"“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”",3167
7308,"I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So Ichanged my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered,serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside andslanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing upbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcelyfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of theafternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower atthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.",3168
7309,"At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed thebusiness of the day.",3169
7310,"As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its risingand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they wereplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in acorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembranceof a host of hanged clients.",3169
7311,"We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,as soon as we got there, dinner was served.",3170
7312,"Although I should not havethought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so muchas a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had noobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way.",3170
7313,But itwas not to be done.,3170
7314,"He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever heraised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as ifthere were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.",3170
7315,"“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr.Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.",3171
7316,"“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you broughtMr. Pip into the office.",3172
7317,Here it is.” He handed it to his principalinstead of to me.,3172
7318,"“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sentup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of youraddress.",3173
7319,She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter ofbusiness you mentioned to her.,3173
7320,You’ll go down?”,3173
7321,"“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly inthose terms.",3174
7322,“When do you think of going down?”,3175
7323,"“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who wasputting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain ofmy time.",3176
7324,"At once, I think.”",3176
7325,"“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr.Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”",3177
7326,"Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, Isettled that I would go to-morrow, and said so.",3178
7327,"Wemmick drank a glassof wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but notat me.",3178
7328,"“So, Pip!",3179
7329,"Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played hiscards.",3179
7330,He has won the pool.”,3179
7331,It was as much as I could do to assent.,3180
7332,“Hah!,3181
7333,He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it allhis own way.,3181
7334,"The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has tobe found out first.",3181
7335,"If he should turn to, and beat her—”",3181
7336,"“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do notseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”",3182
7337,"“I didn’t say so, Pip.",3183
7338,I am putting a case.,3183
7339,"If he should turn to andbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should bea question of intellect, he certainly will not.",3183
7340,"It would be chance workto give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in suchcircumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”",3183
7341,“May I ask what they are?”,3184
7342,"“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “eitherbeats or cringes.",3185
7343,"He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; buthe either beats or cringes.",3185
7344,Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.”,3185
7345,"“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himselfto me.",3186
7346,"“So here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking adecanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each ofus and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled tothe lady’s satisfaction!",3187
7347,"To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ thegentleman, it never will be.",3187
7348,"Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slowyou are to-day!”",3187
7349,"She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon thetable.",3188
7350,"As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,nervously muttering some excuse.",3188
7351,"And a certain action of her fingers,as she spoke, arrested my attention.",3188
7352,“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3189
7353,“Nothing.,3190
7354,"Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was ratherpainful to me.”",3190
7355,The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting.,3191
7356,"She stoodlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, orwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she didgo.",3191
7357,Her look was very intent.,3191
7358,"Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes andsuch hands on a memorable occasion very lately!",3191
7359,"He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room.",3192
7360,But she remainedbefore me as plainly as if she were still there.,3192
7361,"I looked at thosehands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and Icompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband anda stormy life.",3192
7362,"I looked again at those hands and eyes of thehousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come overme when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through thedeserted brewery.",3192
7363,"I thought how the same feeling had come back when Isaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coachwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me likelightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a suddenglare of light in a dark street.",3192
7364,"I thought how one link of associationhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by achance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knittingaction, and the attentive eyes.",3192
7365,And I felt absolutely certain that thiswoman was Estella’s mother.,3192
7366,"Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missedthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal.",3193
7367,"He nodded when I saidthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round thewine again, and went on with his dinner.",3193
7368,"Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in theroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her.",3194
7369,"But her handswere Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she hadreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor lesssure that my conviction was the truth.",3194
7370,"It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,quite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salarywhen that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state ofperpetual readiness for cross-examination.",3195
7371,"As to the quantity of wine,his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-officefor its quantity of letters.",3195
7372,"From my point of view, he was the wrongtwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.",3195
7373,"We took our leave early, and left together.",3196
7374,"Even when we were gropingamong Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the righttwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards downGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I waswalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin hadevaporated into the evening air.",3196
7375,"“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over!",3197
7376,"He’s a wonderful man, without hisliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dinewith him,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”",3197
7377,"I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.",3198
7378,"“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered.",3199
7379,“I know thatwhat is said between you and me goes no further.”,3199
7380,"I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs.Bentley Drummle.",3200
7381,He said no.,3200
7382,"To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke ofthe Aged and of Miss Skiffins.",3200
7383,"He looked rather sly when I mentionedMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a rollof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.",3200
7384,"“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went toMr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”",3201
7385,“Did I?” he replied.,3202
7386,"“Ah, I dare say I did.",3202
7387,"Deuce take me,” he added,suddenly, “I know I did.",3202
7388,I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”,3202
7389,"“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”",3203
7390,“And what do _you_ call her?”,3204
7391,“The same.,3205
7392,"How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”",3205
7393,“That’s his secret.,3206
7394,She has been with him many a long year.”,3206
7395,“I wish you would tell me her story.,3207
7396,I feel a particular interest inbeing acquainted with it.,3207
7397,You know that what is said between you and megoes no further.”,3207
7398,"“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t knowall of it.",3208
7399,But what I do know I’ll tell you.,3208
7400,"We are in our private andpersonal capacities, of course.”",3208
7401,“Of course.”,3209
7402,"“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey formurder, and was acquitted.",3210
7403,"She was a very handsome young woman, and Ibelieve had some gypsy blood in her.",3210
7404,"Anyhow, it was hot enough when itwas up, as you may suppose.”",3210
7405,“But she was acquitted.”,3211
7406,“Mr.,3212
7407,"Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full ofmeaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing.",3212
7408,"It was adesperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, andhe worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said tohave made him.",3212
7409,"He worked it himself at the police-office, day after dayfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trialwhere he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every oneknew—put in all the salt and pepper.",3212
7410,"The murdered person was a woman,—awoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.",3212
7411,It was a case of jealousy.,3212
7412,"They both led tramping lives, and this womanin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point ofjealousy.",3212
7413,"The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, inpoint of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath.",3212
7414,"There hadbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight.",3212
7415,"She was bruised and scratchedand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked.",3212
7416,"Now,there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but thiswoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.Jaggers principally rested his case.",3212
7417,"You may be sure,” said Wemmick,touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength ofher hands then, though he sometimes does now.”",3212
7418,"I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinnerparty.",3213
7419,"“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t yousee?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of herapprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; inparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfullycontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look.",3214
7420,"She had only abruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of herhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?",3214
7421,"Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot ofbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could nothave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambleswere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as thefact that the brambles in question were found on examination to havebeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and littlespots of blood upon them here and there.",3214
7422,"But the boldest point he madewas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, thatshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of themurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three yearsold—to revenge herself upon him.",3214
7423,"Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, andwe show you the brambles.",3214
7424,"You say they are marks of finger-nails, andyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child.",3214
7425,You must acceptall consequences of that hypothesis.,3214
7426,"For anything we know, she may havedestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may havescratched her hands.",3214
7427,What then?,3214
7428,You are not trying her for the murderof her child; why don’t you?,3214
7429,"As to this case, if you _will_ havescratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accountedfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not inventedthem?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr.",3214
7430,"Jaggers was altogether toomany for the jury, and they gave in.”",3214
7431,“Has she been in his service ever since?”,3215
7432,"“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his serviceimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now.",3216
7433,"She has sincebeen taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she wastamed from the beginning.”",3216
7434,“Do you remember the sex of the child?”,3217
7435,“Said to have been a girl.”,3218
7436,“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”,3219
7437,“Nothing.,3220
7438,I got your letter and destroyed it.,3220
7439,Nothing.”,3220
7440,"We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter formy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.",3221
7441,Chapter XLIX.,3223
7442,"Putting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as mycredentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case herwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, Iwent down again by the coach next day.",3224
7443,"But I alighted at the HalfwayHouse, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; forI sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and toleave it in the same manner.",3224
7444,The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quietechoing courts behind the High Street.,3225
7445,"The nooks of ruin where the oldmonks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strongwalls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves.",3225
7446,"The cathedralchimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurriedon avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swellof the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and therooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare hightrees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place waschanged, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.",3225
7447,"An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants wholived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened thegate.",3226
7448,"The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone.",3226
7449,"Miss Havisham wasnot in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.",3226
7450,"Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting onthe hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in thecontemplation of, the ashy fire.",3226
7451,"Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the oldchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes.",3227
7452,"Therewas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me topity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I couldcharge her with.",3227
7453,"As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, inthe progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wreckedfortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me.",3227
7454,"She stared, and said ina low voice, “Is it real?”",3227
7455,"“It is I, Pip.",3228
7456,"Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lostno time.”",3228
7457,“Thank you.,3229
7458,Thank you.”,3229
7459,"As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, Iremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.",3230
7460,"“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me whenyou were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone.",3231
7461,"Butperhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in myheart?”",3231
7462,"When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulousright hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled itagain before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.",3232
7463,"“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to dosomething useful and good.",3233
7464,"Something that you would like done, is itnot?”",3233
7465,“Something that I would like done very much.”,3234
7466,“What is it?”,3235
7467,I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership.,3236
7468,"I hadnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinkingin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said.",3236
7469,"It seemed to beso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showedthat she was conscious of the fact.",3236
7470,"“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being afraidof me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?”",3237
7471,"“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham!",3238
7472,I stoppedbecause I thought you were not following what I said.”,3238
7473,"“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head.",3239
7474,"“Beginagain, and let me look at something else.",3239
7475,Stay!,3239
7476,Now tell me.”,3239
7477,"She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes washabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression offorcing herself to attend.",3240
7478,"I went on with my explanation, and told herhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how inthis I was disappointed.",3240
7479,"That part of the subject (I reminded her)involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for theywere the weighty secrets of another.",3240
7480,"“So!” said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me.",3241
7481,“Andhow much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”,3241
7482,"I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum.",3242
7483,“Ninehundred pounds.”,3242
7484,"“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret asyou have kept your own?”",3243
7485,“Quite as faithfully.”,3244
7486,“And your mind will be more at rest?”,3245
7487,“Much more at rest.”,3246
7488,“Are you very unhappy now?”,3247
7489,"She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in anunwonted tone of sympathy.",3248
7490,"I could not reply at the moment, for myvoice failed me.",3248
7491,"She put her left arm across the head of her stick, andsoftly laid her forehead on it.",3248
7492,"“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes ofdisquiet than any you know of.",3249
7493,They are the secrets I have mentioned.”,3249
7494,"After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fireagain.",3250
7495,“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes ofunhappiness.,3251
7496,Is it true?”,3251
7497,“Too true.”,3252
7498,"“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend?",3253
7499,"Regarding that asdone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?”",3253
7500,“Nothing.,3254
7501,I thank you for the question.,3254
7502,I thank you even more for thetone of the question.,3254
7503,But there is nothing.”,3254
7504,"She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted roomfor the means of writing.",3255
7505,"There were none there, and she took from herpocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, andwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hungfrom her neck.",3255
7506,“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?”,3256
7507,“Quite.,3257
7508,I dined with him yesterday.”,3257
7509,"“This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at yourirresponsible discretion for your friend.",3258
7510,"I keep no money here; but ifyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send itto you.”",3258
7511,"“Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receivingit from him.”",3259
7512,"She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, andevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by thereceipt of the money.",3260
7513,"I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembledagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which thepencil was attached, and put it in mine.",3260
7514,All this she did withoutlooking at me.,3260
7515,“My name is on the first leaf.,3261
7516,"If you can ever write under my name, “Iforgive her,” though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray doit!”",3261
7517,"“O Miss Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now.",3262
7518,"There have been soremistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I wantforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”",3262
7519,"She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her kneesat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often havebeen raised to heaven from her mother’s side.",3263
7520,To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feetgave me a shock through all my frame.,3264
7521,"I entreated her to rise, and gotmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand ofmine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it andwept.",3264
7522,"I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope thatthe relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking.",3264
7523,"She wasnot kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.",3264
7524,"“O!” she cried, despairingly.",3265
7525,“What have I done!,3265
7526,What have I done!”,3265
7527,"“If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let meanswer.",3266
7528,Very little.,3266
7529,I should have loved her under any circumstances.,3266
7530,Is she married?”,3266
7531,“Yes.”,3267
7532,"It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate househad told me so.",3268
7533,“What have I done!,3269
7534,"What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and crushedher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again.",3269
7535,“Whathave I done!”,3269
7536,"I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her.",3270
7537,"That she had done agrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the formthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride foundvengeance in, I knew full well.",3270
7538,"But that, in shutting out the light ofday, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she hadsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do andmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knewequally well.",3270
7539,"And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing herpunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for thisearth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had becomea master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have beencurses in this world?",3270
7540,"“Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you alooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not knowwhat I had done.",3271
7541,What have I done!,3271
7542,"What have I done!” And so again,twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!",3271
7543,"“Miss Havisham,” I said, when her cry had died away, “you may dismissme from your mind and conscience.",3272
7544,"But Estella is a different case, andif you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping apart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do thatthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”",3272
7545,"“Yes, yes, I know it.",3273
7546,"But, Pip—my dear!” There was an earnest womanlycompassion for me in her new affection.",3273
7547,“My dear!,3273
7548,"Believe this: whenshe first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own.",3273
7549,"Atfirst, I meant no more.”",3273
7550,"“Well, well!” said I.",3274
7551,“I hope so.”,3274
7552,"“But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually didworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back andpoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.”",3275
7553,"“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,even to be bruised or broken.”",3276
7554,"With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, andthen burst out again, What had she done!",3277
7555,"“If you knew all my story,” she pleaded, “you would have somecompassion for me and a better understanding of me.”",3278
7556,"“Miss Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I maysay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I firstleft this neighbourhood.",3279
7557,"It has inspired me with great commiseration,and I hope I understand it and its influences.",3279
7558,Does what has passedbetween us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative toEstella?,3279
7559,"Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?”",3279
7560,"She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, andher head leaning on them.",3280
7561,"She looked full at me when I said this, andreplied, “Go on.”",3280
7562,“Whose child was Estella?”,3281
7563,She shook her head.,3282
7564,“You don’t know?”,3283
7565,She shook her head again.,3284
7566,"“But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?”",3285
7567,“Brought her here.”,3286
7568,“Will you tell me how that came about?”,3287
7569,"She answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut up inthese rooms a long time (I don’t know how long; you know what time theclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rearand love, and save from my fate.",3288
7570,"I had first seen him when I sent forhim to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in thenewspapers, before I and the world parted.",3288
7571,He told me that he wouldlook about him for such an orphan child.,3288
7572,"One night he brought her hereasleep, and I called her Estella.”",3288
7573,“Might I ask her age then?”,3289
7574,“Two or three.,3290
7575,"She herself knows nothing, but that she was left anorphan and I adopted her.”",3290
7576,"So convinced I was of that woman’s being her mother, that I wanted noevidence to establish the fact in my own mind.",3291
7577,"But, to any mind, Ithought, the connection here was clear and straight.",3291
7578,What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview?,3292
7579,"I hadsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knewof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind.",3292
7580,Nomatter with what other words we parted; we parted.,3292
7581,Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air.,3293
7582,"Icalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that Iwould not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place beforeleaving.",3293
7583,"For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.",3293
7584,"By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on whichthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, andleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood onend, I made my way to the ruined garden.",3294
7585,I went all round it; round bythe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by thepaths where Estella and I had walked.,3294
7586,"So cold, so lonely, so drearyall!",3294
7587,"Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a littledoor at the garden end of it, and walked through.",3295
7588,"I was going out atthe opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had startedand swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold wasencumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.",3295
7589,"A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment ofthe slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging tothe beam.",3295
7590,"So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beamshuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to besure I was there in an instant.",3295
7591,"The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of thisillusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel anindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where Ihad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart.",3296
7592,"Passing oninto the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to letme out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to goupstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as Ihad left her.",3296
7593,I took the latter course and went up.,3296
7594,"I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated inthe ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her backtowards me.",3297
7595,"In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietlyaway, I saw a great flaming light spring up.",3297
7596,"In the same moment I sawher running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all abouther, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.",3297
7597,"I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.",3298
7598,"That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them overher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the samepurpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on theground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I coveredher, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that thisoccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, orthought, or knew I did.",3298
7599,"I knew nothing until I knew that we were on thefloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight werefloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her fadedbridal dress.",3298
7600,"Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders runningaway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless criesat the door.",3299
7601,"I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, likea prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, orwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that theflames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been hergarments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.",3299
7602,"She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or eventouched.",3300
7603,"Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if Iunreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the firewould break out again and consume her.",3300
7604,"When I got up, on the surgeon’scoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both myhands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense offeeling.",3300
7605,"On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger laymainly in the nervous shock.",3301
7606,"By the surgeon’s directions, her bed wascarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened tobe well suited to the dressing of her injuries.",3301
7607,"When I saw her again,an hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike herstick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.",3301
7608,"Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she stillhad something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they hadcovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with awhite sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something thathad been and was changed was still upon her.",3302
7609,"I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and Igot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the nextpost.",3303
7610,"Miss Havisham’s family I took upon myself; intending tocommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as heliked about informing the rest.",3303
7611,"This I did next day, through Herbert,as soon as I returned to town.",3303
7612,"There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what hadhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity.",3304
7613,"Towards midnight shebegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in thatshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!”And then, “When she first came, I meant to save her from misery likemine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgiveher!’” She never changed the order of these three sentences, but shesometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting inanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.",3304
7614,"As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, thatpressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings couldnot drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that Iwould return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, andbeing taken up clear of the town.",3305
7615,"At about six o’clock of the morning,therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just asthey said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the pencil and writeunder my name, ‘I forgive her.’”",3305
7616,Chapter L.,3307
7617,"My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again inthe morning.",3308
7618,"My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, lessseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flameshad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse.",3308
7619,Myright hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers.,3308
7620,"Itwas bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left handand arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat likea cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck.",3308
7621,"My hair hadbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.",3308
7622,"When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he cameback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me.",3309
7623,"Hewas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and putthem on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply gratefulfor.",3309
7624,"At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, Imight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of theflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell.",3310
7625,"If I dozedfor a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by herrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head.",3310
7626,"This pain ofthe mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain Isuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attentionengaged.",3310
7627,"Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it.",3311
7628,"That wasmade apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by ouragreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands aquestion of so many hours, not of so many weeks.",3311
7629,"My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether allwas well down the river?",3312
7630,"As he replied in the affirmative, with perfectconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until theday was wearing away.",3312
7631,"But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, moreby the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to itspontaneously.",3312
7632,"“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”",3313
7633,“Where was Clara?”,3314
7634,“Dear little thing!” said Herbert.,3315
7635,“She was up and down withGruffandgrim all the evening.,3315
7636,He was perpetually pegging at the floorthe moment she left his sight.,3315
7637,"I doubt if he can hold out long, though.",3315
7638,"What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think hispegging must be nearly over.”",3315
7639,"“And then you will be married, Herbert?”",3316
7640,"“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out uponthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here, and get thebandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes.",3317
7641,I wasspeaking of Provis.,3317
7642,"Do you know, Handel, he improves?”",3317
7643,“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”,3318
7644,“So you did.,3319
7645,And so he is.,3319
7646,"He was very communicative last night, andtold me more of his life.",3319
7647,You remember his breaking off here about somewoman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”,3319
7648,"I had started, but not under his touch.",3320
7649,His words had given me a start.,3320
7650,"“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”",3321
7651,“Well!,3322
7652,"He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.",3322
7653,Shall I tell you?,3322
7654,Or would it worry you just now?”,3322
7655,“Tell me by all means.,3323
7656,Every word.”,3323
7657,"Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had beenrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.",3324
7658,"“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.",3324
7659,"“Quite,” said I.",3325
7660,"“Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”",3325
7661,"“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there’s a bandage off most charmingly, andnow comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,don’t it?",3326
7662,"but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the womanwas a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”",3326
7663,“To what last degree?”,3327
7664,“Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”,3328
7665,“I don’t feel it.,3329
7666,How did she murder?,3329
7667,Whom did she murder?”,3329
7668,"“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” saidHerbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, andthe reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis.",3330
7669,"Itwas another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had beena struggle—in a barn.",3330
7670,"Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for thevictim was found throttled.”",3330
7671,“Was the woman brought in guilty?”,3331
7672,"“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”",3332
7673,"“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.",3333
7674,Yes?,3333
7675,What else?”,3333
7676,“This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a littlechild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond.,3334
7677,"On the evening of the verynight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, theyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and sworethat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and heshould never see it again; then she vanished.—There’s the worst armcomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the righthand, which is a far easier job.",3334
7678,"I can do it better by this light thanby a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don’t see the poorblistered patches too distinctly.—You don’t think your breathing isaffected, my dear boy?",3334
7679,You seem to breathe quickly.”,3334
7680,"“Perhaps I do, Herbert.",3335
7681,Did the woman keep her oath?”,3335
7682,“There comes the darkest part of Provis’s life.,3336
7683,She did.”,3336
7684,"“That is, he says she did.”",3337
7685,"“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me.",3338
7686,“He says it all.,3338
7687,I have no other information.”,3338
7688,"“No, to be sure.”",3339
7689,"“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s mother ill,or whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis doesn’t say; butshe had shared some four or five years of the wretched life hedescribed to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity forher, and forbearance towards her.",3340
7690,"Therefore, fearing he should becalled upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the causeof her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kepthimself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and wasonly vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom thejealousy arose.",3340
7691,"After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lostthe child and the child’s mother.”",3340
7692,“I want to ask—”,3341
7693,"“A moment, my dear boy, and I have done.",3342
7694,"That evil genius, Compeyson,the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keepingout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of courseafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping himpoorer and working him harder.",3342
7695,It was clear last night that this barbedthe point of Provis’s animosity.”,3342
7696,"“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he toldyou when this happened?”",3343
7697,“Particularly?,3344
7698,"Let me remember, then, what he said as to that.",3344
7699,"Hisexpression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after Itook up wi’ Compeyson.’ How old were you when you came upon him in thelittle churchyard?”",3344
7700,“I think in my seventh year.”,3345
7701,“Ay.,3346
7702,"It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and youbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who wouldhave been about your age.”",3346
7703,"“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can yousee me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”",3347
7704,"“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.",3348
7705,“Look at me.”,3349
7706,"“I do look at you, my dear boy.”",3350
7707,“Touch me.”,3351
7708,"“I do touch you, my dear boy.”",3352
7709,"“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is muchdisordered by the accident of last night?”",3353
7710,"“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.",3354
7711,"“You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”",3354
7712,“I know I am quite myself.,3355
7713,"And the man we have in hiding down theriver, is Estella’s Father.”",3355
7714,Chapter LI.,3357
7715,"What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and provingEstella’s parentage, I cannot say.",3358
7716,It will presently be seen that thequestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put beforeme by a wiser head than my own.,3358
7717,"But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I wasseized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matterdown,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.Jaggers, and come at the bare truth.",3359
7718,"I really do not know whether Ifelt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad totransfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned somerays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me.",3359
7719,Perhapsthe latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.,3359
7720,"Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Streetthat night.",3360
7721,"Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probablybe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety woulddepend upon me, alone restrained my impatience.",3360
7722,"On the understanding,again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have myhurts looked after, and to stay at home.",3360
7723,"Early next morning we went outtogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I leftHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.",3360
7724,"There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went overthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all thingsstraight.",3361
7725,"On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers intoMr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into theouter office.",3361
7726,"Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knewwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmicktogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing tocompromise him.",3361
7727,"My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over myshoulders, favoured my object.",3362
7728,"Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a briefaccount of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had togive him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion causedour talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by therules of evidence, than it had been before.",3362
7729,"While I described thedisaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.",3362
7730,"Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in thepockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.",3362
7731,"The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the officialproceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’tsmell fire at the present moment.",3362
7732,"My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then producedMiss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds forHerbert.",3363
7733,"Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head whenI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,with instructions to draw the check for his signature.",3363
7734,"While that wasin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, lookedon at me.",3363
7735,"“I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”",3363
7736,"“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether shecould do nothing for me, and I told her No.”",3364
7737,"“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers.",3365
7738,And I sawWemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”,3365
7739,"“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;“but every man ought to know his own business best.”",3366
7740,"“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,“is portable property.”",3367
7741,"As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had atheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—",3368
7742,"“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir.",3369
7743,"I asked her togive me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gaveme all she possessed.”",3369
7744,"“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots andthen straightening himself.",3370
7745,“Hah!,3370
7746,"I don’t think I should have done so,if I had been Miss Havisham.",3370
7747,But _she_ ought to know her own businessbest.”,3370
7748,"“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child than MissHavisham herself does, sir.",3371
7749,I know her mother.”,3371
7750,"Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”",3372
7751,“I have seen her mother within these three days.”,3373
7752,“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3374
7753,"“And so have you, sir.",3375
7754,And you have seen her still more recently.”,3375
7755,“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3376
7756,"“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I.",3377
7757,“Iknow her father too.”,3377
7758,"A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was tooself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its beingbrought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did notknow who her father was.",3378
7759,"This I had strongly suspected from Provis’saccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’sclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reasonfor claiming his identity.",3378
7760,"But, I could not be sure of thisunconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite sureof it now.",3378
7761,“So!,3379
7762,"You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.",3379
7763,"“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”",3380
7764,Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words.,3381
7765,"It was the slighteststart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and thesooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of theaction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief.",3381
7766,"How Wemmick received theannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him justthen, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that there had beensome communication unknown to him between us.",3381
7767,"“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as hepaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis makethis claim?”",3382
7768,"“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has noknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”",3383
7769,"For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed.",3384
7770,"My reply was sounexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocketwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and lookedwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.",3384
7771,"Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservationthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in factknew from Wemmick.",3385
7772,I was very careful indeed as to that.,3385
7773,"Nor did I looktowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had beenfor some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look.",3385
7774,"When I did at lastturn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted hispen, and was intent upon the table before him.",3385
7775,"“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on thetable.",3386
7776,"“What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”",3386
7777,"But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made apassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank andmanly with me.",3387
7778,"I reminded him of the false hopes into which I hadlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I hadmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits.",3387
7779,"Irepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidencefrom him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted.",3387
7780,"I saidthat I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wantedassurance of the truth from him.",3387
7781,"And if he asked me why I wanted it,and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as hecared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anythingelse in the world.",3387
7782,"And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still andsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned toWemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentleheart.",3387
7783,"I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all theinnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your businesslife.",3387
7784,"And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and torepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to bemore open with me!”",3387
7785,I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe.,3388
7786,"At first, a misgivingcrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from hisemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into somethinglike a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.",3388
7787,“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3389
7788,"“You with an old father, and youwith pleasant and playful ways?”",3389
7789,“Well!” returned Wemmick.,3390
7790,"“If I don’t bring ’em here, what does itmatter?”",3390
7791,"“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smilingopenly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”",3391
7792,"“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder.",3392
7793,“Ithink you’re another.”,3392
7794,"Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently stilldistrustful that the other was taking him in.",3393
7795,“_You_ with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.,3394
7796,"“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it beso.",3395
7797,"Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if _you_ might beplanning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one ofthese days, when you’re tired of all this work.”",3395
7798,"Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, andactually drew a sigh.",3396
7799,"“Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poordreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresherexperience of that kind.",3396
7800,But now about this other matter.,3396
7801,I’ll put acase to you.,3396
7802,Mind!,3396
7803,I admit nothing.”,3396
7804,He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expresslysaid that he admitted nothing.,3397
7805,"“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case.",3398
7806,"Put the case that awoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her childconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legaladviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye tothe latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child.",3398
7807,"Putthe case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for aneccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”",3398
7808,"“I follow you, sir.”",3399
7809,"“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all hesaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certaindestruction.",3400
7810,"Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried ata criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case thathe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growingup to be hanged.",3400
7811,"Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he sawin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to beprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”",3400
7812,"“I follow you, sir.”",3401
7813,"“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of theheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared makeno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had thispower: “I know what you did, and how you did it.",3402
7814,"You came so and so,you did such and such things to divert suspicion.",3402
7815,"I have tracked youthrough it all, and I tell it you all.",3402
7816,"Part with the child, unless itshould be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall beproduced.",3402
7817,"Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bringyou off.",3402
7818,"If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and thatthe woman was cleared.”",3402
7819,“I understand you perfectly.”,3403
7820,“But that I make no admissions?”,3404
7821,"“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”",3405
7822,"“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a littleshaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to besheltered.",3406
7823,"Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down theold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breakingout, by asserting his power over her in the old way.",3406
7824,Do you comprehendthe imaginary case?”,3406
7825,“Quite.”,3407
7826,"“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money.",3408
7827,Thatthe mother was still living.,3408
7828,That the father was still living.,3408
7829,"That themother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so manymiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another.",3408
7830,"That the secret wasstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it.",3408
7831,Put that last caseto yourself very carefully.”,3408
7832,“I do.”,3409
7833,“I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.”,3410
7834,"And Wemmick said, “I do.”",3411
7835,“For whose sake would you reveal the secret?,3412
7836,For the father’s?,3412
7837,I thinkhe would not be much the better for the mother.,3412
7838,For the mother’s?,3412
7839,Ithink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.,3412
7840,Forthe daughter’s?,3412
7841,"I think it would hardly serve her to establish herparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back todisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last forlife.",3412
7842,"But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made herthe subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another,been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell youthat you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well ofit—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged righthand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ offtoo.”",3412
7843,"I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave.",3413
7844,He gravely touched hislips with his forefinger.,3413
7845,I did the same.,3413
7846,Mr. Jaggers did the same.,3413
7847,"“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “whatitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”",3413
7848,"Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that theodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not tosay conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessionallight to the other.",3414
7849,"For this reason, I suppose, they were nowinflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, andWemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallestpoint in abeyance for a moment.",3414
7850,I had never seen them on such illterms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.,3414
7851,"But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance ofMike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose onhis sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearancewithin those walls.",3415
7852,"This individual, who, either in his own person orin that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldestdaughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting.",3415
7853,"As he imparted thismelancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisteriallybefore the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eyehappened to twinkle with a tear.",3415
7854,"“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.",3416
7855,“What do you come snivelling here for?”,3416
7856,"“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”",3417
7857,"“You did,” said Wemmick.",3418
7858,“How dare you?,3418
7859,"You’re not in a fit state tocome here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.",3418
7860,What do you mean by it?”,3418
7861,"“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.",3419
7862,"“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely.",3420
7863,“Say that again!”,3420
7864,"“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, andpointing to the door.",3421
7865,“Get out of this office.,3421
7866,I’ll have no feelingshere.,3421
7867,Get out.”,3421
7868,"“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”",3422
7869,"So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers andWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, andwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they hadjust had lunch.",3423
7870,Chapter LII.,3425
7871,"From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to MissSkiffins’s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’s brother, theaccountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker to me,I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement.",3426
7872,"It was theonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,since I was first apprised of my great expectations.",3426
7873,"Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the Housewere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish asmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extensionof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity wouldgo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for aseparation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been moresettled.",3427
7874,"And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were looseningits hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.",3427
7875,"But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come homeof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he toldme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting ClaraBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to jointhem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up theNile and seeing wonders.",3428
7876,"Without being sanguine as to my own part inthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s way was clearing fast, andthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and hisdaughter would soon be happily provided for.",3428
7877,We had now got into the month of March.,3429
7878,"My left arm, though itpresented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to healthat I was still unable to get a coat on.",3429
7879,"My right arm was tolerablyrestored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.",3429
7880,"On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I receivedthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.",3430
7881,“Walworth.,3431
7882,Burn this as soon as read.,3431
7883,"Early in the week, or sayWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to tryit.",3431
7884,Now burn.”,3431
7885,When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but notbefore we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do.,3432
7886,"For, ofcourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.",3432
7887,"“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think Iknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman.",3433
7888,Take Startop.,3433
7889,"Agood fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic andhonourable.”",3433
7890,I had thought of him more than once.,3434
7891,"“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”",3435
7892,“It is necessary to tell him very little.,3436
7893,"Let him suppose it a merefreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him knowthat there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.",3436
7894,You go with him?”,3436
7895,“No doubt.”,3437
7896,“Where?”,3438
7897,"It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given thepoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam,Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England.",3439
7898,Anyforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.,3439
7899,"Ihad always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in theboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place forsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot.",3439
7900,"As foreign steamers wouldleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to getdown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spotuntil we could pull off to one.",3439
7901,"The time when one would be due where welay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if wemade inquiries beforehand.",3439
7902,"Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately afterbreakfast to pursue our investigations.",3440
7903,"We found that a steamer forHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed ourthoughts chiefly to that vessel.",3440
7904,"But we noted down what other foreignsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfiedourselves that we knew the build and colour of each.",3440
7905,"We then separatedfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings.",3440
7906,"We both did what we had to dowithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported itdone.",3440
7907,"I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seenStartop, and he was more than ready to join.",3440
7908,"Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not ourobject, we should make way enough.",3441
7909,"We arranged that Herbert should notcome home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; thathe should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that heshould prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, onWednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all thearrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and thathe should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him onboard.",3441
7910,"These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.",3442
7911,"On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letterin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though notill-written.",3443
7912,"It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I lefthome), and its contents were these:—",3443
7913,"“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrownight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,you had better come.",3444
7914,"If you want information regarding _your uncleProvis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.",3444
7915,_You must come alone_.,3444
7916,Bring this with you.”,3444
7917,I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strangeletter.,3445
7918,"What to do now, I could not tell.",3445
7919,"And the worst was, that Imust decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which wouldtake me down in time for to-night.",3445
7920,"To-morrow night I could not think ofgoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight.",3445
7921,"Andagain, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have someimportant bearing on the flight itself.",3445
7922,"If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should stillhave gone.",3446
7923,"Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showingme that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go.",3446
7924,"Ishould certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my UncleProvis.",3446
7925,"That, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busypreparation, turned the scale.",3446
7926,"It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents ofalmost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read thismysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to besecret got mechanically into my mind.",3447
7927,"Yielding to it in the samemechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, tellinghim that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, Ihad decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how MissHavisham was faring.",3447
7928,"I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lockup the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways.",3447
7929,"IfI had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should havemissed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came outof the yard.",3447
7930,"I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep instraw, when I came to myself.",3447
7931,"For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; ithad so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning.",3448
7932,"The morninghurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I hadwaited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last.",3448
7933,"And nowI began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubtwhether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to considerwhether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue againstever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass throughall those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I supposevery few hurried people are strangers.",3448
7934,"Still, the reference to Provisby name mastered everything.",3448
7935,"I reasoned as I had reasoned alreadywithout knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm shouldbefall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!",3448
7936,"It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and drearyto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outsidein my disabled state.",3449
7937,"Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn ofminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner.",3449
7938,"While it waspreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; shewas still very ill, though considered something better.",3449
7939,"My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and Idined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font.",3450
7940,"As I was not ableto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it forme.",3450
7941,"This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertainme with my own story,—of course with the popular feature thatPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.",3450
7942,“Do you know the young man?” said I.,3451
7943,“Know him!” repeated the landlord.,3452
7944,“Ever since he was—no height atall.”,3452
7945,“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”,3453
7946,"“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now andagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”",3454
7947,“What man is that?”,3455
7948,"“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord.",3456
7949,“Mr.,3456
7950,Pumblechook.”,3456
7951,“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”,3457
7952,"“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but hecan’t.",3458
7953,And why?,3458
7954,Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”,3458
7955,“Does Pumblechook say so?”,3459
7956,“Say so!” replied the landlord.,3460
7957,“He han’t no call to say so.”,3460
7958,“But does he say so?”,3461
7959,"“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell ofit, sir,” said the landlord.",3462
7960,"I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it.",3463
7961,"Long-sufferingand loving Joe, _you_ never complain.",3463
7962,"Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”",3463
7963,"“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said thelandlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat.",3464
7964,“Try a tendererbit.”,3464
7965,"“No, thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over thefire.",3465
7966,“I can eat no more.,3465
7967,Please take it away.”,3465
7968,"I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, asthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook.",3466
7969,"The falser he, the truer Joe;the meaner he, the nobler Joe.",3466
7970,My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over thefire for an hour or more.,3467
7971,"The striking of the clock aroused me, but notfrom my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastenedround my neck, and went out.",3467
7972,"I had previously sought in my pockets forthe letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw ofthe coach.",3467
7973,"I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was thelittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.",3467
7974,"Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.",3467
7976,Chapter LIII.,3470
7977,"It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosedlands, and passed out upon the marshes.",3471
7978,"Beyond their dark line therewas a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red largemoon.",3471
7979,"In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, inamong the piled mountains of cloud.",3471
7980,"There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal.",3472
7981,"Astranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they wereso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back.",3472
7982,"But I knewthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and hadno excuse for returning, being there.",3472
7983,"So, having come there against myinclination, I went on against it.",3472
7984,"The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, northat in which we had pursued the convicts.",3473
7985,"My back was turned towardsthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the oldlights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder.",3473
7986,"I knewthe limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were milesapart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the twobright specks.",3473
7987,"At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to standstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway aroseand blundered down among the grass and reeds.",3474
7988,But after a little whileI seemed to have the whole flats to myself.,3474
7989,It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln.,3475
7990,"The lime wasburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up andleft, and no workmen were visible.",3475
7991,Hard by was a small stone-quarry.,3475
7992,"Itlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by thetools and barrows that were lying about.",3475
7993,"Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rudepath lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house.",3476
7994,"I quickenedmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand.",3476
7995,"Waiting for some reply,I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof againstthe weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud andooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kilncrept in a ghostly way towards me.",3476
7996,"Still there was no answer, and Iknocked again.",3476
7997,"No answer still, and I tried the latch.",3476
7998,"It rose under my hand, and the door yielded.",3477
7999,"Looking in, I saw alighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a trucklebedstead.",3477
8000,"As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”but no voice answered.",3477
8001,"Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that itwas past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being stillno answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.",3477
8002,It was beginning to rain fast.,3478
8003,"Seeing nothing save what I had seenalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within theshelter of the doorway, looking out into the night.",3478
8004,"While I wasconsidering that some one must have been there lately and must soon becoming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my headto look if the wick were long.",3478
8005,"I turned round to do so, and had takenup the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violentshock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught ina strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.",3478
8006,"“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”",3479
8007,"“What is this?” I cried, struggling.",3480

8199,"Now, as they wentalong, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been broughtthere on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’ssafety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must bemischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, andwent on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within.",3547
8200,"As he couldhear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this waswhile my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether Iwas there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.",3547

8227,"As I looked along theclustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into theunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawnfrom the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.",3553
8228,"From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.",3553
8229,"Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep onthe sofa.",3554
8230,"I could not dress myself without help; but I made up thefire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them.",3554
8231,"Ingood time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted thesharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was stillflowing towards us.",3554
8232,"“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look outfor us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”",3555
8233,Chapter LIV.,3557
8234,"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the windblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.",3558
8235,"Wehad our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag.",3558
8236,Of all my worldlypossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled thebag.,3558
8237,"Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, werequestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, forit was wholly set on Provis’s safety.",3558
8238,"I only wondered for the passingmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what alteredcircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.",3558
8239,"We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as ifwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all.",3559
8240,"Of course, I hadtaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order.",3559
8241,"Aftera little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the twoor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we wenton board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.",3559
8242,"It was thenabout high-water,—half-past eight.",3559
8243,Our plan was this.,3560
8244,"The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and beingwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,and row against it until dark.",3560
8245,"We should then be well in those longreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river isbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, andwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which wecould choose one for a resting-place.",3560
8246,"There, we meant to lie by allnight.",3560
8247,The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam wouldstart from London at about nine on Thursday morning.,3560
8248,"We should know atwhat time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hailthe first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, weshould have another chance.",3560
8249,We knew the distinguishing marks of eachvessel.,3560
8250,The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose wasso great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition inwhich I had been a few hours before.,3561
8251,"The crisp air, the sunlight, themovement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ranwith us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage uson,—freshened me with new hope.",3561
8252,"I felt mortified to be of so little usein the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.",3561
8253,"At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its presentextent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous.",3562
8254,"Of barges, sailingcolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; butof steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part somany.",3562
8255,"Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here andthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was amuch easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; andwe went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.",3562
8256,"Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with itsoyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, andwe were in among the tiers of shipping.",3563
8257,"Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and lookingimmensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, werecolliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging offstages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at hermoorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took goodnotice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit wecrossed.",3563
8258,"And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a fasterbeating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.",3563
8259,“Is he there?” said Herbert.,3564
8260,“Not yet.”,3565
8261,“Right!,3566
8262,He was not to come down till he saw us.,3566
8263,Can you see hissignal?”,3566
8264,“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him!,3567
8265,Pull both.,3567
8266,"Easy, Herbert.",3567
8267,Oars!”,3567
8268,"We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,and we were off again.",3568
8269,"He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvasbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.",3568
8270,"“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took hisseat.",3569
8271,"“Faithful dear boy, well done.",3569
8272,"Thankye, thankye!”",3569
8273,"Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rustychain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for themoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood andshaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under thefigure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firmformality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of herhead; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws going attimber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leakyships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligiblesea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondentlightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where theships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubledwaters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might flyout to the wind.",3570
8274,"At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I hadlooked warily for any token of our being suspected.",3571
8275,I had seen none.,3571
8276,"Wecertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were noteither attended or followed by any boat.",3571
8277,"If we had been waited on byany boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,or to make her purpose evident.",3571
8278,But we held our own without anyappearance of molestation.,3571
8279,"He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a naturalpart of the scene.",3572
8280,It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life hehad led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.,3572
8281,"He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see hisgentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was notdisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had nonotion of meeting danger half way.",3572
8282,"When it came upon him, he confrontedit, but it must come before he troubled himself.",3572
8283,"“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit herealonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by daybetwixt four walls, you’d envy me.",3573
8284,But you don’t know what it is.”,3573
8285,"“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.",3574
8286,"“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely.",3575
8287,“But you don’t know it equalto me.,3575
8288,"You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know itequal to me,—but I ain’t a-going to be low.”",3575
8289,"It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, heshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life.",3576
8290,But I reflectedthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all thehabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man.,3576
8291,"Iwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—",3576
8292,"“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world, Iwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, forall I was a growing rich.",3577
8293,"Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch couldcome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be troubled abouthim.",3577
8294,"They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn’t be,leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”",3577
8295,"“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe againwithin a few hours.”",3578
8296,"“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”",3579
8297,“And think so?”,3580
8298,"He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—",3581
8299,"“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy.",3582
8300,We’d be puzzled to be more quietand easy-going than we are at present.,3582
8301,"But—it’s a flowing so soft andpleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it—I was athinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to thebottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of thisriver what I catches hold of.",3582
8302,Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tidethan I can hold this.,3582
8303,"And it’s run through my fingers and gone, yousee!” holding up his dripping hand.",3582
8304,"“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” saidI.",3583
8305,"“Not a bit on it, dear boy!",3584
8306,"It comes of flowing on so quiet, and ofthat there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.",3584
8307,Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”,3584
8308,"He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression offace, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out ofEngland.",3585
8309,"Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had beenin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beerinto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought hewould be safest where he was, and he said.",3585
8310,"“Do you, dear boy?” andquietly sat down again.",3585
8311,"The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and thesunshine was very cheering.",3586
8312,"The tide ran strong, I took care to losenone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well.",3586
8313,"Byimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more ofthe nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between themuddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.",3586
8314,"As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within aboat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catchthe stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of alarge transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us.",3586
8315,"Andsoon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were takingadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon usin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength ofthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows andmudbanks.",3586
8316,"Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drivewith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s restproved full as much as they wanted.",3587
8317,"We got ashore among some slipperystones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.",3587
8318,"Itwas like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dimhorizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the greatfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemedstranded and still.",3587
8319,"For now the last of the fleet of ships was roundthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and someballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open pilesstood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakesstuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and redlandmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stageand an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us wasstagnation and mud.",3587
8320,"We pushed off again, and made what way we could.",3588
8321,"It was much harderwork now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed androwed until the sun went down.",3588
8322,"By that time the river had lifted us alittle, so that we could see above the bank.",3588
8323,"There was the red sun, onthe low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening intoblack; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there werethe rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.",3588
8324,"As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, forclearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we couldfind.",3589
8325,"So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out foranything like a house.",3589
8326,"Thus we held on, speaking little, for four orfive dull miles.",3589
8327,"It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, withher galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.",3589
8328,"The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; andwhat light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, asthe oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.",3589
8329,At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that wewere followed.,3590
8330,"As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregularintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one orother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction.",3590
8331,"Here andthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a littlecreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed themnervously.",3590
8332,"Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in alow voice.",3590
8333,"Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we wouldfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking withwhat an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.",3590
8334,"At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ranalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hardby.",3591
8335,"Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the lightto be in a window of a public-house.",3591
8336,"It was a dirty place enough, and Idare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a goodfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and variousliquors to drink.",3591
8337,"Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such asthey were,” the landlord said.",3591
8338,"No other company was in the house thanthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of thelittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had beenlow-water mark too.",3591
8339,"With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all cameashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and allelse, and hauled her up for the night.",3592
8340,"We made a very good meal by thekitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startopwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other.",3592
8341,"We found the air ascarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and therewere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should havethought the family possessed.",3592
8342,"But we considered ourselves well off,notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.",3592
8343,"While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, theJack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoeson, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, asinteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of adrowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oaredgalley going up with the tide?",3593
8344,"When I told him No, he said she musthave gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.",3593
8345,"“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,” saidthe Jack, “and gone down.”",3594
8346,"“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.",3595
8347,"“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”",3596
8348,“Did they come ashore here?”,3597
8349,“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer.,3598
8350,"I’d ha’ beenglad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some rattlingphysic in it.”",3598
8351,“Why?”,3599
8352,"“_I_ know why,” said the Jack.",3600
8353,"He spoke in a slushy voice, as if muchmud had washed into his throat.",3600
8354,"“He thinks,” said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a paleeye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—“he thinks they was, whatthey wasn’t.”",3601
8355,"“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.",3602
8356,"“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.",3603
8357,"“I do,” said the Jack.",3604
8358,"“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”",3605
8359,“AM I!”,3606
8360,"In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence inhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it onagain.",3607
8361,He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that hecould afford to do anything.,3607
8362,"“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,Jack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.",3608
8363,“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack.,3609
8364,“Chucked ’em overboard.,3609
8365,Swallered ’em.,3609
8366,"Sowed ’em, to come up small salad.",3609
8367,Done with theirbuttons!”,3609
8368,"“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy andpathetic way.",3610
8369,"“A Custom ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said theJack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “whenthey comes betwixt him and his own light.",3611
8370,"A four and two sitters don’tgo hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, andboth with and against another, without there being Custom ’Us at thebottom of it.” Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue thesubject.",3611
8371,"This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy.",3612
8372,"The dismal windwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, andI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened.",3612
8373,A four-oared galleyhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was anugly circumstance that I could not get rid of.,3612
8374,"When I had inducedProvis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startopby this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.",3612
8375,"Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put offearly in the morning, was the question we discussed.",3612
8376,"On the whole wedeemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an houror so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, anddrift easily with the tide.",3612
8377,"Having settled to do this, we returned intothe house and went to bed.",3612
8378,"I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for afew hours.",3613
8379,"When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startledme.",3613
8380,"Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of thewindow.",3613
8381,"It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I sawtwo men looking into her.",3613
8382,"They passed by under the window, looking atnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which Icould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the directionof the Nore.",3613
8383,"My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men goingaway.",3614
8384,"But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the backof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harderday than I, and were fatigued, I forbore.",3614
8385,"Going back to my window, Icould see the two men moving over the marsh.",3614
8386,"In that light, however, Isoon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of thematter, and fell asleep again.",3614
8387,We were up early.,3615
8388,"As we walked to and fro, all four together, beforebreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen.",3615
8389,Again ourcharge was the least anxious of the party.,3615
8390,"It was very likely that themen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had nothought of us.",3615
8391,"I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,it might easily be.",3615
8392,"However, I proposed that he and I should walk awaytogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should takeus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at aboutnoon.",3615
8393,"This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast heand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.",3615
8394,"He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap meon the shoulder.",3616
8395,"One would have supposed that it was I who was indanger, not he, and that he was reassuring me.",3616
8396,We spoke very little.,3616
8397,"Aswe approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men hadpassed in the night.",3616
8398,"He complied, and I went on alone.",3616
8399,"There was noboat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor werethere any signs of the men having embarked there.",3616
8400,"But, to be sure, thetide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.",3616
8401,"When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that Iwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes movingabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round.",3617
8402,"We gotaboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer.",3617
8403,"By thattime it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look outfor her smoke.",3617
8404,"But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwardswe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer.",3618
8405,"As they were coming onat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity ofsaying good-bye to Herbert and Startop.",3618
8406,"We had all shaken handscordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when Isaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little wayahead of us, and row out into the same track.",3618
8407,"A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,coming head on.",3619
8408,"I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before thetide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis tosit quite still, wrapped in his cloak.",3619
8409,"He answered cheerily, “Trust tome, dear boy,” and sat like a statue.",3619
8410,"Meantime the galley, which wasvery skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, andfallen alongside.",3619
8411,"Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke ortwo when we pulled.",3619
8412,"Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, andlooked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter waswrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper someinstruction to the steerer as he looked at us.",3619
8413,Not a word was spoken ineither boat.,3619
8414,"Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.",3620
8415,"She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grewlouder and louder.",3620
8416,"I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,when the galley hailed us.",3620
8417,I answered.,3620
8418,"“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the lines.",3621
8419,"“That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak.",3621
8420,"His name is Abel Magwitch,otherwise Provis.",3621
8421,"I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,and you to assist.”",3621
8422,"At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,he ran the galley abroad of us.",3622
8423,"They had pulled one sudden strokeahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding onto our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing.",3622
8424,"This caused greatconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, andheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, butfelt her driving down upon us irresistibly.",3622
8425,"In the same moment, I sawthe steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quitefrantically.",3622
8426,"Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of theshrinking sitter in the galley.",3622
8427,"Still in the same moment, I saw thatthe face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.",3622
8428,"Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a whiteterror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on boardthe steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sinkfrom under me.",3622
8429,"It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousandmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I wastaken on board the galley.",3623
8430,"Herbert was there, and Startop was there;but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.",3623
8431,"What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off ofher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at firstdistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of thegalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strongstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently andeagerly at the water astern.",3624
8432,"Presently a dark object was seen in it,bearing towards us on the tide.",3624
8433,"No man spoke, but the steersman held uphis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight andtrue before it.",3624
8434,"As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,but not swimming freely.",3624
8435,"He was taken on board, and instantly manacledat the wrists and ankles.",3624
8436,"The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the waterwas resumed.",3625
8437,"But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently notunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed.",3625
8438,"By the time she hadbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, andwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water.",3625
8439,"The look-outwas kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers weregone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.",3625
8440,"At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavernwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.",3626
8441,"Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis nolonger,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and adeep cut in the head.",3626
8442,"He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of thesteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising.",3627
8443,The injury tohis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thoughthe had received against the side of the galley.,3627
8444,"He added that he didnot pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identifyhim, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they hadboth gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep himin it, had capsized us.",3627
8445,"He told me in a whisper that they had gone downfiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been astruggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,and swum away.",3627
8446,I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus toldme.,3628
8447,The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of theirgoing overboard.,3628
8448,"When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wetclothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at thepublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must takecharge of everything his prisoner had about him.",3629
8449,So the pocket-bookwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s.,3629
8450,He furthergave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined toaccord that grace to my two friends.,3629
8451,"The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gonedown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it waslikeliest to come ashore.",3630
8452,His interest in its recovery seemed to me tobe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on.,3630
8453,"Probably, ittook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that mayhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were invarious stages of decay.",3630
8454,"We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and thenMagwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board.",3631
8455,"Herbert andStartop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could.",3631
8456,"We had adoleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I feltthat that was my place henceforth while he lived.",3631
8457,"For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a manwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through aseries of years.",3632
8458,I only saw in him a much better man than I had been toJoe.,3632
8459,"His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,and often he could not repress a groan.",3633
8460,"I tried to rest him on the armI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that Icould not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it wasunquestionably best that he should die.",3633
8461,"That there were, still living,people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could notdoubt.",3633
8462,"That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope.",3633
8463,"He who hadbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since brokenprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportationunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man whowas the cause of his arrest.",3633
8464,"As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him howgrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.",3634
8465,"“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance.",3635
8466,"I’veseen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”",3635
8467,No.,3636
8468,"I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side.",3636
8469,No.,3636
8470,"Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick’s hint now.",3636
8471,"I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited tothe Crown.",3636
8472,"“Lookee here, dear boy,” said he “It’s best as a gentleman should notbe knowed to belong to me now.",3637
8473,Only come to see me as if you come bychance alonger Wemmick.,3637
8474,"Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, forthe last o’ many times, and I don’t ask no more.”",3637
8475,"“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to benear you.",3638
8476,"Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!”",3638
8477,"I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away ashe lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in histhroat,—softened now, like all the rest of him.",3639
8478,"It was a good thingthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I mightnot otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never knowhow his hopes of enriching me had perished.",3639
8479,Chapter LV.,3641
8480,"He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have beenimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send downfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,to speak to his identity.",3642
8481,"Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who hadmeant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happenedthat there was not at that time any prison officer in London who couldgive the required evidence.",3642
8482,"I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at hisprivate house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, andMr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing.",3642
8483,"It was thesole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in fiveminutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth couldprevent its going against us.",3642
8484,I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of thefate of his wealth.,3643
8485,"Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me forhaving “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialiseby and by, and try at all events for some of it.",3643
8486,"But he did not concealfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which theforfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in thiscase to make it one of them.",3643
8487,I understood that very well.,3643
8488,"I was notrelated to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before hisapprehension, and to do so now would be idle.",3643
8489,"I had no claim, and Ifinally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that myheart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting toestablish one.",3643
8490,"There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer hadhoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained someaccurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs.",3644
8491,"When his body was found, manymiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that hewas only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were stilllegible, folded in a case he carried.",3644
8492,"Among these were the name of abanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and thedesignation of certain lands of considerable value.",3644
8493,"Both these heads ofinformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit.",3644
8494,"Hisignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted butthat my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.",3644
8495,"After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood overfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witnesscame, and completed the easy case.",3645
8496,"He was committed to take his trialat the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.",3645
8497,"It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home oneevening, a good deal cast down, and said,—",3646
8498,"“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”",3647
8499,"His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than hethought.",3648
8500,"“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I amvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”",3649
8501,"“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; butmy need is no greater now than at another time.”",3650
8502,“You will be so lonely.”,3651
8503,"“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I.",3652
8504,"“You know that I amalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that Ishould be with him all day long, if I could.",3652
8505,"And when I come away fromhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.”",3652
8506,"The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling toboth of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.",3653
8507,"“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of ourseparation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling youabout yourself.",3654
8508,Have you thought of your future?”,3654
8509,"“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”",3655
8510,"“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it mustnot be dismissed.",3656
8511,"I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a fewfriendly words go, with me.”",3656
8512,"“I will,” said I.",3657
8513,"“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”",3658
8514,"I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “Aclerk.”",3659
8515,“A clerk.,3660
8516,And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as aclerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner.,3660
8517,"Now,Handel,—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”",3660
8518,"There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner inwhich after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning ofa portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.",3661
8519,"“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued,“and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears inher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we cometogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince herhusband’s friend that he is her friend too.",3662
8520,"We should get on so well,Handel!”",3662
8521,"I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I couldnot yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered.",3663
8522,"Firstly, mymind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.",3663
8523,"Secondly,—Yes!",3663
8524,"Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in mythoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.",3663
8525,"“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injuryto your business, leave the question open for a little while—”",3664
8526,"“For any while,” cried Herbert.",3665
8527,"“Six months, a year!”",3665
8528,"“Not so long as that,” said I.",3666
8529,“Two or three months at most.”,3666
8530,"Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he mustgo away at the end of the week.",3667
8531,“And Clara?” said I.,3668
8532,"“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to herfather as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long.",3669
8533,Mrs. Whimpleconfides to me that he is certainly going.”,3669
8534,"“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”",3670
8535,"“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert; “and then I shallcome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and Iwill walk quietly into the nearest church.",3671
8536,Remember!,3671
8537,"The blesseddarling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into thered book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa.",3671
8538,What a fortune forthe son of my mother!”,3671
8539,"On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full ofbright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of theseaport mail coaches.",3672
8540,"I went into a coffee-house to write a little noteto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over andover again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.",3672
8541,"On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after anunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door.",3673
8542,"I had not seen himalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he hadcome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words ofexplanation in reference to that failure.",3673
8543,"“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got atthe bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it wasfrom the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his peoplebeing always in trouble) that I heard what I did.",3674
8544,"I kept my ears open,seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and Ithought that would be the best time for making the attempt.",3674
8545,"I can onlysuppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,habitually to deceive his own instruments.",3674
8546,"You don’t blame me, I hope,Mr. Pip?",3674
8547,"I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”",3674
8548,"“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you mostearnestly for all your interest and friendship.”",3675
8549,"“Thank you, thank you very much.",3676
8550,"It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick,scratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for along time.",3676
8551,What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portableproperty.,3676
8552,Dear me!”,3676
8553,"“What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”",3677
8554,"“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick.",3678
8555,"“Of course, there can be no objectionto your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myselfto get him out of it.",3678
8556,But what I look at is this.,3678
8557,"The late Compeysonhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, andbeing so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could havebeen saved.",3678
8558,"Whereas, the portable property certainly could have beensaved.",3678
8559,"That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’tyou see?”",3678
8560,"I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass ofgrog before walking to Walworth.",3679
8561,He accepted the invitation.,3679
8562,"While hewas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead upto it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—",3679
8563,"“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”",3680
8564,"“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”",3681
8565,"“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick.",3682
8566,“Yes.,3682
8567,I’m going totake a holiday.,3682
8568,More than that; I’m going to take a walk.,3682
8569,More thanthat; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”,3682
8570,"I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,when Wemmick anticipated me.",3683
8571,"“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts,Mr. Pip.",3684
8572,"But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.",3684
8573,"It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one.",3684
8574,Say it might occupy you(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve.,3684
8575,Couldn’t youstretch a point and manage it?”,3684
8576,"He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very littleto do for him.",3685
8577,"I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was sovery much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too.",3685
8578,"At hisparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at halfpast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.",3685
8579,"Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Mondaymorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as lookingtighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on.",3686
8580,"Within, there were twoglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits.",3686
8581,"The Aged must havebeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of hisbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.",3686
8582,"When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, andwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I wasconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put itover his shoulder.",3687
8583,"“Why, we are not going fishing!” said I.",3687
8584,"“No,”returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”",3687
8585,"I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off.",3688
8586,"We wenttowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick saidsuddenly,—",3688
8587,“Halloa!,3689
8588,Here’s a church!”,3689
8589,"There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rathersurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—",3690
8590,“Let’s go in!”,3691
8591,"We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and lookedall round.",3692
8592,"In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,and getting something out of paper there.",3692
8593,“Halloa!” said he.,3693
8594,“Here’s a couple of pair of gloves!,3693
8595,Let’s put ’emon!”,3693
8596,"As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widenedto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions.",3694
8597,"Theywere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a sidedoor, escorting a lady.",3694
8598,“Halloa!” said Wemmick.,3695
8599,“Here’s Miss Skiffins!,3695
8600,Let’s have a wedding.”,3695
8601,"That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was nowengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white.",3696
8602,TheAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for thealtar of Hymen.,3696
8603,"The old gentleman, however, experienced so muchdifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary toput him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind thepillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the oldgentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and saferesistance.",3696
8604,"By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on toperfection.",3696
8605,"The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order atthose fatal rails.",3697
8606,"True to his notion of seeming to do it all withoutpreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something outof his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa!",3697
8607,Here’s aring!”,3697
8608,"I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made afeint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins.",3698
8609,"The responsibility ofgiving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to theclergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.",3698
8610,"When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” theold gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony wehad arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.",3698
8611,"Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to bemarried to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of mostestimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomedvoice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged repliedwith great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,all right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause uponit, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completelymarried that day.",3698
8612,"It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of churchWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,and put the cover on again.",3699
8613,"Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green.",3699
8614,"“_Now_, Mr.Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we cameout, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be awedding-party!”",3699
8615,"Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or soaway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelleboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds afterthe solemnity.",3700
8616,"It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longerunwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat ina high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might havedone.",3700
8617,"We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything ontable, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraidof it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to theCastle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as Icould.",3701
8618,"Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands withhim, and wished him joy.",3702
8619,"“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands.",3703
8620,"“She’s such a manager offowls, you have no idea.",3703
8621,"You shall have some eggs, and judge foryourself.",3703
8622,"I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low.",3703
8623,"“This isaltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”",3703
8624,“I understand.,3704
8625,"Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.",3704
8626,Wemmick nodded.,3705
8627,"“After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers mayas well not know of it.",3705
8628,"He might think my brain was softening, orsomething of the kind.”",3705
8629,Chapter LVI.,3707
8630,"He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between hiscommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions.",3708
8631,"He had brokentwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with greatpain and difficulty, which increased daily.",3708
8632,It was a consequence of hishurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spokevery little.,3708
8633,"But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became thefirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew heought to hear.",3708
8634,"Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, afterthe first day or so, into the infirmary.",3709
8635,This gave me opportunities ofbeing with him that I could not otherwise have had.,3709
8636,"And but for hisillness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as adetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.",3709
8637,"Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, theregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to recordon his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state.",3710
8638,"Ido not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; hewasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the daywhen the prison door closed upon him.",3710
8639,The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a manwho was tired out.,3711
8640,"I sometimes derived an impression, from his manneror from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he ponderedover the question whether he might have been a better man under bettercircumstances.",3711
8641,"But he never justified himself by a hint tending thatway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.",3711
8642,"It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that hisdesperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people inattendance on him.",3712
8643,"A smile crossed his face then, and he turned hiseyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I hadseen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I wasa little child.",3712
8644,"As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and Inever knew him complain.",3712
8645,"When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to bemade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions.",3713
8646,"Itwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,and was refused.",3713
8647,"The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to thebar, he was seated in a chair.",3713
8648,"No objection was made to my gettingclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that hestretched forth to me.",3713
8649,The trial was very short and very clear.,3714
8650,"Such things as could be saidfor him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and hadthriven lawfully and reputably.",3714
8651,"But nothing could unsay the fact thathe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury.",3714
8652,"Itwas impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find himguilty.",3714
8653,"At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terribleexperience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passingof Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence ofDeath.",3715
8654,"But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holdsbefore me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, thatI saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive thatsentence together.",3715
8655,"Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.",3715
8656,"The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glitteringin the rays of April sun.",3716
8657,"Penned in the dock, as I again stood outsideit at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men andwomen; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing andweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about.",3716
8658,"Therehad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had beenstilled, and a hush had succeeded.",3716
8659,"The sheriffs with their great chainsand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a greatgallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as thetwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted.",3716
8660,Then the Judgeaddressed them.,3716
8661,"Among the wretched creatures before him whom he mustsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy hadbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonmentsand punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term ofyears; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, hadmade his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life.",3716
8662,"That miserableman would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, whenfar removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived apeaceable and honest life.",3716
8663,"But in a fatal moment, yielding to thosepropensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long renderedhim a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest andrepentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.",3716
8664,"Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evadingthe officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act offlight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by expressdesign, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of hisdenouncer, to whom his whole career was known.",3716
8665,"The appointed punishmentfor his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and hiscase being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.",3716
8666,"The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through theglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft oflight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth allthings, and cannot err.",3717
8667,"Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of facein this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received mysentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat downagain.",3717
8668,"There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he hadto say to the rest.",3717
8669,"Then they were all formally doomed, and some ofthem were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggardlook of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or threeshook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they hadtaken from the sweet herbs lying about.",3717
8670,"He went last of all, because ofhaving to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he heldmy hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience gotup (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at himand me.",3717
8671,"I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’sReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began thatnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, settingforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for mysake.",3718
8672,"I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when Ihad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such menin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to theCrown itself.",3718
8673,"For several days and nights after he was sentenced I tookno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbedin these appeals.",3718
8674,"And after I had sent them in, I could not keep awayfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopefuland less desperate when I was near them.",3718
8675,"In this unreasonablerestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.",3718
8676,"To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, andtheir long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.",3718
8677,"The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was morestrictly kept.",3719
8678,"Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of anintention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before Isat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of thesingleness of my designs.",3719
8679,Nobody was hard with him or with me.,3719
8680,"Therewas duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly.",3719
8681,"The officeralways gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sickprisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them assick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God bethanked!)",3719
8682,always joined in the same report.,3719
8683,"As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidlylooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his faceuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it wouldsubside again.",3720
8684,"Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, thenhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew tounderstand his meaning very well.",3720
8685,"The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change inhim than I had seen yet.",3721
8686,"His eyes were turned towards the door, andlighted up as I entered.",3721
8687,"“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.",3722

8699,That’s best of all.”,3728

8704,“You never do complain.”,3732
8705,He had spoken his last words.,3733
8706,"He smiled, and I understood his touch tomean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast.",3733
8707,"I laidit there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.",3733
8708,"The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, Ifound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,“You needn’t go yet.” I thanked him gratefully, and asked, “Might Ispeak to him, if he can hear me?”",3734
8709,"The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away.",3735
8710,"The change,though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placidlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.",3735
8711,"“Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last.",3736
8712,You understand what Isay?”,3736
8713,A gentle pressure on my hand.,3737

8720,"With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for myyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips.",3741
8721,"Then,he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lyingon it.",3741
8722,"The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,and his head dropped quietly on his breast.",3741
8723,"Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two menwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no betterwords that I could say beside his bed, than “O Lord, be merciful to hima sinner!”",3742

8727,I oughtrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy andconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truthbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill.,3745
8728,"The late stress upon mehad enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew thatit was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was evencareless as to that.",3745
8729,"For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,—anywhere,according as I happened to sink down,—with a heavy head and achinglimbs, and no purpose, and no power.",3746
8730,"Then there came, one night whichappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, Ifound I could not do so.",3746
8731,"Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of thenight, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whetherI had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with greatterror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had foundmyself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming upthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had beeninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, andgroaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of myown making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a darkcorner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that Itried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay thatmorning on my bed.",3747
8732,"But the vapour of a limekiln would come between meand them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at lastthat I saw two men looking at me.",3747
8733,"“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”",3748
8734,"“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on theshoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say, butyou’re arrested.”",3749

8740,“I keep a very nicehouse.”,3753
8741,I made some attempt to get up and dress myself.,3754

8743,Istill lay there.,3754
8744,"“You see my state,” said I.",3755
8745,“I would come with you if I could; butindeed I am quite unable.,3755

8747,"Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me tobelieve that I was better than I thought.",3756
8748,"Forasmuch as they hang in mymemory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know what they did,except that they forbore to remove me.",3756
8749,"That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that Ioften lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that Iconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was abrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from thegiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of avast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I imploredin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammeredoff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my ownremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time.",3757
8750,"That I sometimesstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, andthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, andwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay medown, I also knew at the time.",3757
8751,"But, above all, I knew that there was aconstant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, wouldpresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,and would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that therewas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, tosettle down into the likeness of Joe.",3757
8752,"After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to noticethat while all its other features changed, this one consistent featuredid not change.",3758
8753,"Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe.",3758
8754,"Iopened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at thebedside, Joe.",3758
8755,"I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on thewindow-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I sawJoe.",3758
8756,"I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me wasJoe’s.",3758
8757,"I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face thatlooked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.",3758
8758,"At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “_Is_ it Joe?”",3759
8759,"And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”",3760
8760,"“O Joe, you break my heart!",3761
8761,"Look angry at me, Joe.",3761
8762,"Strike me, Joe.",3761
8763,Tellme of my ingratitude.,3761
8764,Don’t be so good to me!”,3761
8765,"For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, andput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.",3762
8766,"“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.",3763
8767,And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”,3763
8768,"After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his backtowards me, wiping his eyes.",3764
8769,"And as my extreme weakness prevented mefrom getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,“O God bless him!",3764
8770,O God bless this gentle Christian man!”,3764

8772,"“How long, dear Joe?”",3766
8773,"“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear oldchap?”",3767

8775,"“It’s the end of May, Pip.",3769
8776,To-morrow is the first of June.”,3769
8777,"“And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?”",3770
8778,"“Pretty nigh, old chap.",3771
8779,"For, as I says to Biddy when the news of yourbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a dealof walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,and marriage were the great wish of his hart—”",3771
8780,"“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe!",3772
8781,But I interrupt you in what yousaid to Biddy.”,3772
8782,"“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers,and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such amoment might not prove unacceptabobble.",3773
8783,"And Biddy, her word were, ‘Goto him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with hisjudicial air, “were the word of Biddy.",3773
8784,"‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘withoutloss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added,after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the wordof that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”",3773
8785,"There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked toin great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment atstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and thatI was to submit myself to all his orders.",3774
8786,"So I kissed his hand, and layquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love init.",3774
8787,Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write.,3775
8788,"As I lay in bed looking athim, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see thepride with which he set about his letter.",3775
8789,"My bedstead, divested of itscurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, asthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and theroom kept always fresh and wholesome night and day.",3775
8790,"At my ownwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from thepen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up hissleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer.",3775
8791,"It wasnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it mighthave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his penspluttering extensively.",3775
8792,"He had a curious idea that the inkstand was onthe side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen intospace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result.",3775
8793,"Occasionally, he wastripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole hegot on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and hadremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head withhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying theeffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,with unbounded satisfaction.",3775
8794,"Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able totalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day.",3776
8795,Heshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.,3776
8796,"“Is she dead, Joe?”",3777
8797,"“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and byway of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”",3778
8798,"“Living, Joe?”",3779
8799,"“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”",3780
8800,"“Did she linger long, Joe?”",3781
8801,"“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if youwas put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, tocome at everything by degrees.",3782
8802,"“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”",3783
8803,"“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the mostof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella.",3784
8804,"But she hadwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore theaccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket.",3784
8805,"And why,do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousandunto him?",3784
8806,"‘Because of Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew.’ I amtold by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legalturn as if it did him infinite good, “‘account of him the saidMatthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”",3784
8807,"I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperatureof the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of moneymore to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its beingcool.",3785
8808,"This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing Ihad done.",3786
8809,I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the otherrelations had any legacies?,3786
8810,"“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur tobuy pills, on account of being bilious.",3787
8811,"Miss Georgiana, she have twentypound down.",3787
8812,"Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, oldchap?”",3787
8813,"“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.",3788
8814,Joe nodded.,3789
8815,“Mrs.,3789
8816,"Camels,” by which I presently understood he meantCamilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her inspirits when she wake up in the night.”",3789
8817,"The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to giveme great confidence in Joe’s information.",3790
8818,"“And now,” said Joe, “youain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor oneadditional shovelful to-day.",3790
8819,Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open adwelling-ouse.”,3790
8820,“Whose?” said I.,3791
8821,"“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” saidJoe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, andcastles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time.",3792
8822,"And wotsume’erthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”",3792
8823,"“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”",3793
8824,"“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took hiscash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied himup to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed hismouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out.",3794
8825,"But heknowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”",3794
8826,By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation.,3795
8827,"I was slowto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joestayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.",3795
8828,"For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,that I was like a child in his hands.",3796
8829,"He would sit and talk to me inthe old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the oldunassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all mylife since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troublesof the fever that was gone.",3796
8830,"He did everything for me except thehousehold work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, afterpaying off the laundress on his first arrival.",3796
8831,"“Which I do assure you,Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found hera tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off thefeathers in a bucket, for sale.",3796
8832,"Which she would have tapped yourn next,and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying awaythe coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and thewine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”",3796
8833,"We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we hadonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship.",3797
8834,"And when the daycame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I werestill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given ofthe wealth of his great nature.",3797
8835,"And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,and sweet summer scents filled all the air.",3798
8836,"The day happened to beSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought howit had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had beenforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day andby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burningand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossedthere came like a check upon my peace.",3798
8837,"But when I heard the Sundaybells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, Ifelt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet tobe even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid itlong ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was toomuch for my young senses.",3798
8838,"More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used totalk, lying on the grass at the old Battery.",3799
8839,There was no changewhatever in Joe.,3799
8840,"Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in myeyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.",3799
8841,"When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me—soeasily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventfulChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes.",3800
8842,"We had not yetmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much ofmy late history he was acquainted with.",3800
8843,"I was so doubtful of myselfnow, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myselfwhether I ought to refer to it when he did not.",3800
8844,"“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon furtherconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patronwas?”",3801
8845,"“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”",3802
8846,"“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”",3803
8847,“Well!,3804
8848,"I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ youthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”",3804
8849,“So it was.”,3805
8850,"“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.",3806
8851,"“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, withincreasing diffidence.",3807
8852,“Which?,3808
8853,"Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”",3808
8854,“Yes.”,3809
8855,"“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking ratherevasively at the window-seat, “as I _did_ hear tell that how he weresomething or another in a general way in that direction.”",3810
8856,"“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”",3811
8857,"“Not partickler, Pip.”",3812
8858,"“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up andcame to my sofa.",3813
8859,"“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me.",3814
8860,"“Ever the best offriends; ain’t us, Pip?”",3814
8861,I was ashamed to answer him.,3815
8862,"“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; “that’s all right;that’s agreed upon.",3816
8863,"Then why go into subjects, old chap, which asbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary?",3816
8864,"There’s subjects enoughas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones.",3816
8865,Lord!,3816
8866,To think of yourpoor sister and her Rampages!,3816
8867,And don’t you remember Tickler?”,3816
8868,"“I do indeed, Joe.”",3817
8869,"“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe.",3818
8870,"“I done what I could to keep you andTickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to myinclinations.",3818
8871,"For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, itwere not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “thatshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but thatshe dropped into you always heavier for it.",3818
8872,I noticed that.,3818
8873,"It ain’t agrab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which yoursister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a littlechild out of punishment.",3818
8874,"But when that little child is dropped intoheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally upand says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing?",3818
8875,"I grant youI see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good.",3818
8876,"I call uponyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”",3818
8877,"“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.",3819
8878,"“The man says,” Joe assented.",3820
8879,"“Is he right, that man?”",3820
8880,"“Dear Joe, he is always right.”",3821
8881,"“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words.",3822
8882,"If he’s alwaysright (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when hesays this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, whenyou was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J.Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equalto his inclinations.",3822
8883,"Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt twosech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects.",3822
8884,"Biddygiv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almostawful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in thislight, as I should so put it.",3822
8885,"Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmedwith his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a truefriend, say.",3822
8886,Namely.,3822
8887,"You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you musthave your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixtthe sheets.”",3822
8888,"The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tactand kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me outso soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind.",3823
8889,"Butwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had alldissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could notunderstand.",3823
8890,"Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began todevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehensionof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little lesseasy with me.",3824
8891,"In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dearfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears.",3824
8892,"I too hadfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me.",3824
8893,"But,imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them beganto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began tounderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it wasall mine.",3824
8894,Ah!,3825
8895,"Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think thatin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off?",3825
8896,"Had I givenJoe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I gotstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had betterloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?",3825
8897,"It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in theTemple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him veryplainly.",3826
8898,"We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking atthe river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—",3826
8899,"“See, Joe!",3827
8900,I can walk quite strongly.,3827
8901,"Now, you shall see me walk backby myself.”",3827
8902,"“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur tosee you able, sir.”",3828
8903,The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate!,3829
8904,"I walked nofurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weakerthan I was, and asked Joe for his arm.",3829
8905,"Joe gave it me, but wasthoughtful.",3829
8906,"I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growingchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts.",3830
8907,"That Iwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had comedown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was notquite an unworthy one.",3830
8908,"He would want to help me out of his littlesavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that Imust not suffer him to do it.",3830
8909,It was a thoughtful evening with both of us.,3831
8910,"But, before we went tobed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow beingSunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week.",3831
8911,"On Mondaymorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside thislast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to goout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever.",3831
8912,"As Icleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympatheticallyarrived at a resolution too.",3831
8913,"We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, andthen walked in the fields.",3832
8914,"“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.",3833
8915,"“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”",3834
8916,"“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”",3835
8917,"“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.",3836
8918,"“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget.",3837
8919,"There weredays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shallforget these.”",3837
8920,"“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there hasbeen larks.",3838
8921,"And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”",3838
8922,"At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had doneall through my recovery.",3839
8923,He asked me if I felt sure that I was as wellas in the morning?,3839
8924,"“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”",3840
8925,"“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”",3841
8926,"“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”",3842
8927,"Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, andsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”",3843
8928,"When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full ofmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay.",3844
8929,I would tell him beforebreakfast.,3844
8930,"I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;for, it was the first day I had been up early.",3844
8931,"I went to his room, andhe was not there.",3844
8932,"Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.",3844
8933,"I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter.",3845
8934,Thesewere its brief contents:—,3845
8935,“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dearPip and will do better without,3846
8936,JO.,3847
8937,“P.S.,3848
8938,Ever the best of friends.”,3848
8939,Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which Ihad been arrested.,3849
8940,"Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that mycreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should bequite recovered.",3849
8941,"I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money;but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.",3849
8942,"What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, andthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrancewith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reservedSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in mythoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?",3850
8943,"The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her howhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lostall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences inmy first unhappy time.",3851
8944,"Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think youonce liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayedaway from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has beensince.",3851
8945,"If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can takeme with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you canreceive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, andhave as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I ama little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little.",3851
8946,"And,Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forgewith Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down inthis country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where anopportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until Iknew your answer.",3851
8947,"And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you willgo through the world with me, you will surely make it a better worldfor me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it abetter world for you.”",3851
8948,Such was my purpose.,3852
8949,"After three days more of recovery, I went down tothe old place to put it in execution.",3852
8950,And how I sped in it is all Ihave left to tell.,3852
8951,Chapter LVIII.,3854
8952,The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down tomy native place and its neighbourhood before I got there.,3855
8953,"I found theBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made agreat change in the Boar’s demeanour.",3855
8954,"Whereas the Boar had cultivatedmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going outof property.",3855
8955,"It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had sooften made so easily.",3856
8956,"The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), andcould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons andpost-chaises up the yard.",3856
8957,"But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging asin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, andthe quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.",3856
8958,"Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolledround by Satis House.",3857
8959,"There were printed bills on the gate and on bitsof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction ofthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week.",3857
8960,"The House itself was tobe sold as old building materials, and pulled down.",3857
8961,LOT 1 was marked inwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part ofthe main building which had been so long shut up.,3857
8962,"Other lots weremarked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torndown to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low inthe dust and was withered already.",3857
8963,"Stepping in for a moment at the opengate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a strangerwho had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on thecasks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had sooften pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.",3857
8964,"When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr.Pumblechook conversing with the landlord.",3858
8965,"Mr. Pumblechook (not improvedin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, andaddressed me in the following terms:—",3858
8966,"“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low.",3859
8967,But what else could beexpected!,3859
8968,what else could be expected!”,3859
8969,"As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as Iwas broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.",3860
8970,"“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.",3861
8971,And has it come to this!,3861
8972,Has it come to this!”,3861
8973,I frowningly sat down to my breakfast.,3862
8974,Mr. Pumblechook stood over meand poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of abenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.,3862
8975,"“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on.",3863
8976,"Inhappier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar?",3863
8977,And did youtake milk?,3863
8978,You did.,3863
8979,Sugar and milk.,3863
8980,"William, bring a watercress.”",3863
8981,"“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”",3864
8982,"“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding hishead several times, as if he might have expected that, and as ifabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall.",3865
8983,“True.,3865
8984,The simple fruits of the earth.,3865
8985,No.,3865
8986,"You needn’t bring any, William.”",3865
8987,"I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to standover me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.",3866
8988,"“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud.",3867
8989,"“Andyet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spreadafore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”",3867
8990,"This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile mannerin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited thesame fat five fingers.",3868
8991,"“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread and butter.",3869
8992,“And air youa-going to Joseph?”,3869
8993,"“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does itmatter to you where I am going?",3870
8994,Leave that teapot alone.”,3870
8995,"It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechookthe opportunity he wanted.",3871
8996,"“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article inquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for thebehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I _will_ leave thatteapot alone.",3872
8997,"You are right, young man.",3872
8998,For once you are right.,3872
8999,"Iforgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as towish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects ofprodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of yourforefathers.",3872
9000,"And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord andwaiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I eversported with in his days of happy infancy!",3872
9001,Tell me not it cannot be; Itell you this is him!”,3872
9002,A low murmur from the two replied.,3873
9003,The waiter appeared to beparticularly affected.,3873
9004,"“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart.",3874
9005,Thisis him as I have seen brought up by hand.,3874
9006,"This is him untoe the sisterof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria fromher own mother, let him deny it if he can!”",3874
9007,"The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gavethe case a black look.",3875
9008,"“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the oldfashion, “you air a-going to Joseph.",3876
9009,"What does it matter to me, you askme, where you air a-going?",3876
9010,"I say to you, Sir, you air a-going toJoseph.”",3876
9011,"The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.",3877
9012,"“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air ofsaying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing andconclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph.",3878
9013,"Here is Squires ofthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here isWilliam, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceivemyself.”",3878
9014,"“You do not, sir,” said William.",3879
9015,"“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man,what to say to Joseph.",3880
9016,"Says you, “Joseph, I have this day seen myearliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s.",3880
9017,"I will name nonames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I haveseen that man.”",3880
9018,"“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.",3881
9019,"“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook.",3882
9020,"“Say you said that, and evenJoseph will probably betray surprise.”",3882
9021,"“There you quite mistake him,” said I.",3883
9022,“I know better.”,3883
9023,"“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, andthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice.",3884
9024,"He knows yourcharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness andignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want ofgratitoode.",3884
9025,"Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his headand hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common humangratitoode.",3884
9026,"_He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can.",3884
9027,"_You_ do not know it,Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”",3884
9028,"Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the faceto talk thus to mine.",3885
9029,"“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will nowrepeat.",3886
9030,"It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger ofProvidence.",3886
9031,"He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw itplain.",3886
9032,"It pinted out this writing, Joseph.",3886
9033,"_Reward of ingratitoode tohis earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s_.",3886
9034,"But that man said hedid not repent of what he had done, Joseph.",3886
9035,Not at all.,3886
9036,"It was right todo it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he woulddo it again.’”",3886
9037,"“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interruptedbreakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would doagain.”",3887
9038,"“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,“and William!",3888
9039,"I have no objections to your mentioning, either up townor down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to doit, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”",3888
9040,"With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted bythe virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not long after him inleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw himholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to aselect group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as Ipassed on the opposite side of the way.",3889
9041,"But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whosegreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,contrasted with this brazen pretender.",3890
9042,"I went towards them slowly, formy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drewnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulnessfurther and further behind.",3890
9043,The June weather was delicious.,3891
9044,"The sky was blue, the larks weresoaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside morebeautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet.",3891
9045,"Manypleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of thechange for the better that would come over my character when I had aguiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom Ihad proved, beguiled my way.",3891
9046,"They awakened a tender emotion in me; formy heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,and whose wanderings had lasted many years.",3891
9047,"The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, thelittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness’sake, took me past it.",3892
9048,"I was disappointed to find that the day was aholiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed.",3892
9049,"Somehopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.",3892
9050,"But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards itunder the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.",3893
9051,"Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied Iheard it and found it but a fancy, all was still.",3893
9052,"The limes were there,and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, andtheir leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, theclink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.",3893
