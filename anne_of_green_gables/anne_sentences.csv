0,﻿CHAPTER I. Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Surprised,0
1," MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies’ eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool and cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde’s Hollow it was a quiet, well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s door without due regard for decency and decorum; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window, keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.",1
2,"There are plenty of people, in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend closely to their neighbors’ business by dint of neglecting their own; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain.",2
3,"She was a notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she “ran” the Sewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary.",2
4,"Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting “cotton warp” quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond.",2
5,"Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with water on two sides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel’s all-seeing eye.",2
6,She was sitting there one afternoon in early June.,3
7,"The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees.",3
8,Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called “Rachel Lynde’s husband”--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables.,3
9,Mrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blair’s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon.,3
10,"Peter had asked him, of course, for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life.",3
11,"And yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill; moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable distance.",4
12,"Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?",4
13,"Had it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions.",5
14,But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk.,5
15,"Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn’t happen often.",5
16,"Mrs. Rachel, ponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon’s enjoyment was spoiled.",5
17,"“I’ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he’s gone and why,” the worthy woman finally concluded.",6
18,“He doesn’t generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if he’d run out of turnip seed he wouldn’t dress up and take the buggy to go for more; he wasn’t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.,6
19,Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off.,6
20,"I’m clean puzzled, that’s what, and I won’t know a minute’s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today.”",6
21,"Accordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out; she had not far to go; the big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde’s Hollow.",7
22,"To be sure, the long lane made it a good deal further.",7
23,"Matthew Cuthbert’s father, as shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead.",7
24,"Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated.",7
25,Mrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place _living_ at all.,7
26,"“It’s just _staying_, that’s what,” she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes.",8
27,"“It’s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves.",8
28,"Trees aren’t much company, though dear knows if they were there’d be enough of them.",8
29,I’d ruther look at people.,8
30,"To be sure, they seem contented enough; but then, I suppose, they’re used to it.",8
31,"A body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.”",8
32,With this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables.,9
33,"Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and on the other with prim Lombardies.",9
34,"Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been.",9
35,Privately she was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house.,9
36,One could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt.,9
37,Mrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so.,10
38,The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor.,10
39,"Its windows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on the back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one, whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines.",10
40,"Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind her was laid for supper.",10
41,"Mrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table.",11
42,"There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any particular company.",11
43,Yet what of Matthew’s white collar and the sorrel mare?,11
44,"Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.",11
45,"“Good evening, Rachel,” Marilla said briskly.",12
46,"“This is a real fine evening, isn’t it?",12
47,Won’t you sit down?,12
48,How are all your folks?”,12
49,"Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.",13
50,"Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it.",14
51,"She looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she was; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had been ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor.",14
52,"“We’re all pretty well,” said Mrs. Rachel.",15
53,"“I was kind of afraid _you_ weren’t, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today.",15
54,I thought maybe he was going to the doctor’s.”,15
55,Marilla’s lips twitched understandingly.,16
56,She had expected Mrs. Rachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor’s curiosity.,16
57,"“Oh, no, I’m quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,” she said.",17
58,“Matthew went to Bright River.,17
59,We’re getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he’s coming on the train tonight.”,17
60,If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.,18
61,She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds.,18
62,"It was unsupposable that Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to suppose it.",18
63,"“Are you in earnest, Marilla?” she demanded when voice returned to her.",19
64,"“Yes, of course,” said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.",20
65,Mrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt.,21
66,She thought in exclamation points.,21
67,A boy!,21
68,Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people adopting a boy!,21
69,From an orphan asylum!,21
70,"Well, the world was certainly turning upside down!",21
71,She would be surprised at nothing after this!,21
72,Nothing!,21
73,“What on earth put such a notion into your head?” she demanded disapprovingly.,22
74,"This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved.",23
75,"“Well, we’ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,”  returned Marilla.",24
76,“Mrs.,24
77,Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring.,24
78,Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited her and knows all about it.,24
79,So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since.,24
80,We thought we’d get a boy.,24
81,"Matthew is getting up in years, you know--he’s sixty--and he isn’t so spry as he once was.",24
82,His heart troubles him a good deal.,24
83,And you know how desperate hard it’s got to be to get hired help.,24
84,"There’s never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he’s up and off to the lobster canneries or the States.",24
85,At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy.,24
86,But I said ‘no’ flat to that.,24
87,"‘They may be all right--I’m not saying they’re not--but no London street Arabs for me,’ I said.",24
88,‘Give me a native born at least.,24
89,"There’ll be a risk, no matter who we get.",24
90,But I’ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.’ So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl.,24
91,"We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer’s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven.",24
92,We decided that would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper.,24
93,We mean to give him a good home and schooling.,24
94,We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight.,24
95,So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him.,24
96,Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there.,24
97,Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself.”,24
98,"Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news.",25
99,"“Well, Marilla, I’ll just tell you plain that I think you’re doing a mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that’s what.",26
100,You don’t know what you’re getting.,26
101,You’re bringing a strange child into your house and home and you don’t know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he’s likely to turn out.,26
102,"Why, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds.",26
103,And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs--they couldn’t break him of it.,26
104,"If you had asked my advice in the matter--which you didn’t do, Marilla--I’d have said for mercy’s sake not to think of such a thing, that’s what.”",26
105,This Job’s comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla.,27
106,She knitted steadily on.,27
107,"“I don’t deny there’s something in what you say, Rachel.",28
108,I’ve had some qualms myself.,28
109,But Matthew was terrible set on it.,28
110,"I could see that, so I gave in.",28
111,It’s so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does I always feel it’s my duty to give in.,28
112,"And as for the risk, there’s risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world.",28
113,There’s risks in people’s having children of their own if it comes to that--they don’t always turn out well.,28
114,And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.,28
115,It isn’t as if we were getting him from England or the States.,28
116,He can’t be much different from ourselves.”,28
117,"“Well, I hope it will turn out all right,” said Mrs. Rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts.",29
118,“Only don’t say I didn’t warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies.,29
119,"Only, it was a girl in that instance.”",29
120,"“Well, we’re not getting a girl,” said Marilla, as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy.",30
121,“I’d never dream of taking a girl to bring up.,30
122,I wonder at Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it.,30
123,"But there, _she_ wouldn’t shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.”",30
124,Mrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his imported orphan.,31
125,But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert Bell’s and tell the news.,31
126,"It would certainly make a sensation second to none, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to make a sensation.",31
127,"So she took herself away, somewhat to Marilla’s relief, for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of Mrs. Rachel’s pessimism.",31
128,"“Well, of all things that ever were or will be!” ejaculated Mrs. Rachel when she was safely out in the lane.",32
129,“It does really seem as if I must be dreaming.,32
130,"Well, I’m sorry for that poor young one and no mistake.",32
131,"Matthew and Marilla don’t know anything about children and they’ll expect him to be wiser and steadier than his own grandfather, if so be’s he ever had a grandfather, which is doubtful.",32
132,"It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow; there’s never been one there, for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built--if they ever _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.",32
133,I wouldn’t be in that orphan’s shoes for anything.,32
134,"My, but I pity him, that’s what.”",32
135,So said Mrs. Rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and more profound.,33
136, CHAPTER II.,35
137,Matthew Cuthbert Is Surprised,35
138, MATTHEW Cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River.,36
139,"It was a pretty road, running along between snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom.",36
140,The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while,36
141,     “The little birds sang as if it were      The one day of summer in all the year.”,37
142,"Matthew enjoyed the drive after his own fashion, except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them--for in Prince Edward Island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not.",38
143,Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him.,39
144,"He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty.",39
145,"In fact, he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.",39
146,"When he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train; he thought he was too early, so he tied his horse in the yard of the small Bright River hotel and went over to the station house.",40
147,The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end.,40
148,"Matthew, barely noting that it _was_ a girl, sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her.",40
149,Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression.,40
150,"She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and, since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then, she sat and waited with all her might and main.",40
151,"Matthew encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper, and asked him if the five-thirty train would soon be along.",41
152,"“The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago,” answered that brisk official.",42
153,“But there was a passenger dropped off for you--a little girl.,42
154,She’s sitting out there on the shingles.,42
155,"I asked her to go into the ladies’ waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside.",42
156,"‘There was more scope for imagination,’ she said.",42
157,"She’s a case, I should say.”",42
158,"“I’m not expecting a girl,” said Matthew blankly.",43
159,“It’s a boy I’ve come for.,43
160,He should be here.,43
161,Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over from Nova Scotia for me.”,43
162,The stationmaster whistled.,44
163,"“Guess there’s some mistake,” he said.",45
164,“Mrs.,45
165,Spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge.,45
166,Said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently.,45
167,That’s all I know about it--and I haven’t got any more orphans concealed hereabouts.”,45
168,"“I don’t understand,” said Matthew helplessly, wishing that Marilla was at hand to cope with the situation.",46
169,"“Well, you’d better question the girl,” said the stationmaster carelessly.",47
170,"“I dare say she’ll be able to explain--she’s got a tongue of her own, that’s certain.",47
171,Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted.”,47
172,"He walked jauntily away, being hungry, and the unfortunate Matthew was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den--walk up to a girl--a strange girl--an orphan girl--and demand of her why she wasn’t a boy.",48
173,Matthew groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her.,48
174,She had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now.,49
175,"Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would have seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very tight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey.",49
176,"She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair.",49
177,"Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.",49
178,"So far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short, our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom shy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.",50
179,"Matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag; the other she held out to him.",51
180,"“I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?” she said in a peculiarly clear, sweet voice.",52
181,“I’m very glad to see you.,52
182,I was beginning to be afraid you weren’t coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you.,52
183,"I had made up my mind that if you didn’t come for me tonight I’d go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night.",52
184,"I wouldn’t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don’t you think?",52
185,"You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn’t you?",52
186,"And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn’t tonight.”",52
187,Matthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and there he decided what to do.,53
188,He could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and let Marilla do that.,53
189,"She couldn’t be left at Bright River anyhow, no matter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.",53
190,"“I’m sorry I was late,” he said shyly.",54
191,“Come along.,54
192,The horse is over in the yard.,54
193,Give me your bag.”,54
194,"“Oh, I can carry it,” the child responded cheerfully.",55
195,“It isn’t heavy.,55
196,"I’ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn’t heavy.",55
197,And if it isn’t carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I’d better keep it because I know the exact knack of it.,55
198,It’s an extremely old carpet-bag.,55
199,"Oh, I’m very glad you’ve come, even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree.",55
200,"We’ve got to drive a long piece, haven’t we?",55
201,Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles.,55
202,I’m glad because I love driving.,55
203,"Oh, it seems so wonderful that I’m going to live with you and belong to you.",55
204,I’ve never belonged to anybody--not really.,55
205,But the asylum was the worst.,55
206,"I’ve only been in it four months, but that was enough.",55
207,"I don’t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can’t possibly understand what it is like.",55
208,It’s worse than anything you could imagine.,55
209,"Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that, but I didn’t mean to be wicked.",55
210,"It’s so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn’t it?",55
211,"They were good, you know--the asylum people.",55
212,But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just in the other orphans.,55
213,"It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess.",55
214,"I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because I didn’t have time in the day.",55
215,"I guess that’s why I’m so thin--I _am_ dreadful thin, ain’t I?",55
216,There isn’t a pick on my bones.,55
217,"I do love to imagine I’m nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.”",55
218,"With this Matthew’s companion stopped talking, partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy.",56
219,"Not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.",56
220,The child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy.,57
221,“Isn’t that beautiful?,58
222,"What did that tree, leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy, make you think of?” she asked.",58
223,"“Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.",59
224,"“Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.",60
225,"I’ve never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like.",60
226,I don’t ever expect to be a bride myself.,60
227,I’m so homely nobody will ever want to marry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary.,60
228,I suppose a foreign missionary mightn’t be very particular.,60
229,But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress.,60
230,That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss.,60
231,I just love pretty clothes.,60
232,"And I’ve never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember--but of course it’s all the more to look forward to, isn’t it?",60
233,And then I can imagine that I’m dressed gorgeously.,60
234,This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress.,60
235,"All the orphans had to wear them, you know.",60
236,A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum.,60
237,"Some people said it was because he couldn’t sell it, but I’d rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart, wouldn’t you?",60
238,When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me.,60
239,"But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_ imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots.",60
240,I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might.,60
241,I wasn’t a bit sick coming over in the boat.,60
242,"Neither was Mrs. Spencer, although she generally is.",60
243,"She said she hadn’t time to get sick, watching to see that I didn’t fall overboard.",60
244,She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about.,60
245,"But if it kept her from being seasick it’s a mercy I did prowl, isn’t it?",60
246,"And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn’t know whether I’d ever have another opportunity.",60
247,"Oh, there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom!",60
248,This Island is the bloomiest place.,60
249,"I just love it already, and I’m so glad I’m going to live here.",60
250,"I’ve always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world, and I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I would.",60
251,"It’s delightful when your imaginations come true, isn’t it?",60
252,But those red roads are so funny.,60
253,When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn’t know and for pity’s sake not to ask her any more questions.,60
254,She said I must have asked her a thousand already.,60
255,"I suppose I had, too, but how are you going to find out about things if you don’t ask questions?",60
256,And what _does_ make the roads red?”,60
257,"“Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.",61
258,"“Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime.",62
259,Isn’t it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about?,62
260,It just makes me feel glad to be alive--it’s such an interesting world.,62
261,"It wouldn’t be half so interesting if we knew all about everything, would it?",62
262,"There’d be no scope for imagination then, would there?",62
263,But am I talking too much?,62
264,People are always telling me I do.,62
265,Would you rather I didn’t talk?,62
266,If you say so I’ll stop.,62
267,"I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it, although it’s difficult.”",62
268,"Matthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself.",63
269,Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it.,63
270,But he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl.,63
271,"Women were bad enough in all conscience, but little girls were worse.",63
272,"He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word.",63
273,That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl.,63
274,"But this freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he “kind of liked her chatter.” So he said as shyly as usual:",63
275,"“Oh, you can talk as much as you like.",64
276,I don’t mind.”,64
277,"“Oh, I’m so glad.",65
278,I know you and I are going to get along together fine.,65
279,It’s such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard.,65
280,I’ve had that said to me a million times if I have once.,65
281,And people laugh at me because I use big words.,65
282,"But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven’t you?”",65
283,"“Well now, that seems reasonable,” said Matthew.",66
284,“Mrs.,67
285,Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle.,67
286,But it isn’t--it’s firmly fastened at one end.,67
287,Mrs. Spencer said your place was named Green Gables.,67
288,I asked her all about it.,67
289,And she said there were trees all around it.,67
290,I was gladder than ever.,67
291,I just love trees.,67
292,"And there weren’t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.",67
293,"They just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did.",67
294,It used to make me want to cry to look at them.,67
295,"I used to say to them, ‘Oh, you _poor_ little things!",67
296,"If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in your branches, you could grow, couldn’t you?",67
297,But you can’t where you are.,67
298,"I know just exactly how you feel, little trees.’ I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning.",67
299,"You do get so attached to things like that, don’t you?",67
300,Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables?,67
301,I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that.”,67
302,"“Well now, yes, there’s one right below the house.”",68
303,“Fancy.,69
304,It’s always been one of my dreams to live near a brook.,69
305,"I never expected I would, though.",69
306,"Dreams don’t often come true, do they?",69
307,Wouldn’t it be nice if they did?,69
308,But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy.,69
309,"I can’t feel exactly perfectly happy because--well, what color would you call this?”",69
310,She twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it up before Matthew’s eyes.,70
311,"Matthew was not used to deciding on the tints of ladies’ tresses, but in this case there couldn’t be much doubt.",70
312,"“It’s red, ain’t it?” he said.",71
313,The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.,72
314,"“Yes, it’s red,” she said resignedly.",73
315,“Now you see why I can’t be perfectly happy.,73
316,Nobody could who has red hair.,73
317,I don’t mind the other things so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness.,73
318,I can imagine them away.,73
319,I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes.,73
320,But I _cannot_ imagine that red hair away.,73
321,I do my best.,73
322,"I think to myself, ‘Now my hair is a glorious black, black as the raven’s wing.’ But all the time I _know_ it is just plain red and it breaks my heart.",73
323,It will be my lifelong sorrow.,73
324,I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn’t red hair.,73
325,Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.,73
326,What is an alabaster brow?,73
327,I never could find out.,73
328,Can you tell me?”,73
329,"“Well now, I’m afraid I can’t,” said Matthew, who was getting a little dizzy.",74
330,He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy had enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.,74
331,"“Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful.",75
332,Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful?”,75
333,"“Well now, no, I haven’t,” confessed Matthew ingenuously.",76
334,"“I have, often.",77
335,Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?”,77
336,"“Well now, I--I don’t know exactly.”",78
337,“Neither do I. I can never decide.,79
338,But it doesn’t make much real difference for it isn’t likely I’ll ever be either.,79
339,It’s certain I’ll never be angelically good.,79
340,"Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert!",79
341,"Oh, Mr.",79
342,Cuthbert!!,79
343,"Oh, Mr.",79
344,Cuthbert!!,79
345,!”,79
346,That was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled out of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing.,80
347,They had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the “Avenue.”,80
348,"The “Avenue,” so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road four or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge, wide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer.",81
349,Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom.,81
350,Below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle.,81
351,Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb.,82
352,"She leaned back in the buggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above.",82
353,Even when they had passed out and were driving down the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke.,82
354,"Still with rapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw visions trooping splendidly across that glowing background.",82
355,"Through Newbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still in silence.",82
356,When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken.,82
357,"She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically as she could talk.",82
358,"“I guess you’re feeling pretty tired and hungry,” Matthew ventured to say at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of.",83
359,“But we haven’t very far to go now--only another mile.”,83
360,"She came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.",84
361,"“Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,” she whispered, “that place we came through--that white place--what was it?”",85
362,"“Well now, you must mean the Avenue,” said Matthew after a few moments’ profound reflection.",86
363,“It is a kind of pretty place.”,86
364,“Pretty?,87
365,"Oh, _pretty_ doesn’t seem the right word to use.",87
366,"Nor beautiful, either.",87
367,They don’t go far enough.,87
368,"Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.",87
369,It’s the first thing I ever saw that couldn’t be improved upon by imagination.,87
370,It just satisfied me here”--she put one hand on her breast--“it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache.,87
371,"Did you ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?”",87
372,"“Well now, I just can’t recollect that I ever had.”",88
373,“I have it lots of times--whenever I see anything royally beautiful.,89
374,But they shouldn’t call that lovely place the Avenue.,89
375,There is no meaning in a name like that.,89
376,They should call it--let me see--the White Way of Delight.,89
377,Isn’t that a nice imaginative name?,89
378,When I don’t like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so.,89
379,"There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins, but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere.",89
380,"Other people may call that place the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.",89
381,Have we really only another mile to go before we get home?,89
382,I’m glad and I’m sorry.,89
383,I’m sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I’m always sorry when pleasant things end.,89
384,"Something still pleasanter may come after, but you can never be sure.",89
385,And it’s so often the case that it isn’t pleasanter.,89
386,That has been my experience anyhow.,89
387,But I’m glad to think of getting home.,89
388,"You see, I’ve never had a real home since I can remember.",89
389,It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home.,89
390,"Oh, isn’t that pretty!”",89
391,They had driven over the crest of a hill.,90
392,"Below them was a pond, looking almost like a river so long and winding was it.",90
393,"A bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found.",90
394,Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows.,90
395,Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tiptoeing to her own reflection.,90
396,"From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.",90
397,"There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its windows.",90
398,"“That’s Barry’s pond,” said Matthew.",91
399,"“Oh, I don’t like that name, either.",92
400,I shall call it--let me see--the Lake of Shining Waters.,92
401,"Yes, that is the right name for it.",92
402,I know because of the thrill.,92
403,When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill.,92
404,Do things ever give you a thrill?”,92
405,Matthew ruminated.,93
406,"“Well now, yes.",94
407,It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds.,94
408,I hate the look of them.”,94
409,"“Oh, I don’t think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill.",95
410,Do you think it can?,95
411,"There doesn’t seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters, does there?",95
412,But why do other people call it Barry’s pond?”,95
413,“I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house.,96
414,Orchard Slope’s the name of his place.,96
415,If it wasn’t for that big bush behind it you could see Green Gables from here.,96
416,"But we have to go over the bridge and round by the road, so it’s near half a mile further.”",96
417,“Has Mr. Barry any little girls?,97
418,"Well, not so very little either--about my size.”",97
419,“He’s got one about eleven.,98
420,Her name is Diana.”,98
421,“Oh!” with a long indrawing of breath.,99
422,“What a perfectly lovely name!”,99
423,"“Well now, I dunno.",100
424,"There’s something dreadful heathenish about it, seems to me.",100
425,I’d ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.,100
426,But when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.”,100
427,"“I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born, then.",101
428,"Oh, here we are at the bridge.",101
429,I’m going to shut my eyes tight.,101
430,I’m always afraid going over bridges.,101
431,"I can’t help imagining that perhaps, just as we get to the middle, they’ll crumple up like a jack-knife and nip us.",101
432,So I shut my eyes.,101
433,But I always have to open them for all when I think we’re getting near the middle.,101
434,"Because, you see, if the bridge _did_ crumple up I’d want to _see_ it crumple.",101
435,What a jolly rumble it makes!,101
436,I always like the rumble part of it.,101
437,Isn’t it splendid there are so many things to like in this world?,101
438,"There, we’re over.",101
439,Now I’ll look back.,101
440,"Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters.",101
441,"I always say good night to the things I love, just as I would to people.",101
442,I think they like it.,101
443,That water looks as if it was smiling at me.”,101
444,When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner Matthew said:,102
445,“We’re pretty near home now.,103
446,That’s Green Gables over--”,103
447,"“Oh, don’t tell me,” she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his partially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his gesture.",104
448,“Let me guess.,104
449,I’m sure I’ll guess right.”,104
450,She opened her eyes and looked about her.,105
451,They were on the crest of a hill.,105
452,"The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still clear in the mellow afterlight.",105
453,To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky.,105
454,"Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it.",105
455,"From one to another the child’s eyes darted, eager and wistful.",105
456,"At last they lingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods.",105
457,"Over it, in the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise.",105
458,"“That’s it, isn’t it?” she said, pointing.",106
459,Matthew slapped the reins on the sorrel’s back delightedly.,107
460,"“Well now, you’ve guessed it!",108
461,But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it so’s you could tell.”,108
462,"“No, she didn’t--really she didn’t.",109
463,All she said might just as well have been about most of those other places.,109
464,I hadn’t any real idea what it looked like.,109
465,But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home.,109
466,"Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream.",109
467,"Do you know, my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up, for I’ve pinched myself so many times today.",109
468,Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I’d be so afraid it was all a dream.,109
469,Then I’d pinch myself to see if it was real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I’d better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped pinching.,109
470,But it _is_ real and we’re nearly home.”,109
471,With a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence.,110
472,Matthew stirred uneasily.,110
473,He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all.,110
474,"They drove over Lynde’s Hollow, where it was already quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them from her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green Gables.",110
475,By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand.,110
476,"It was not of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them, but of the child’s disappointment.",110
477,When he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering something--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.,110
478,The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it.,111
479,"“Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,” she whispered, as he lifted her to the ground.",112
480,“What nice dreams they must have!”,112
481,"Then, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained “all her worldly goods,” she followed him into the house.",113
482, CHAPTER III.,115
483,Marilla Cuthbert Is Surprised,115
484, MARILLA came briskly forward as Matthew opened the door.,116
485,"But when her eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short in amazement.",116
486,"“Matthew Cuthbert, who’s that?” she ejaculated.",117
487,“Where is the boy?”,117
488,"“There wasn’t any boy,” said Matthew wretchedly.",118
489,“There was only _her_.”,118
490,"He nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her name.",119
491,“No boy!,120
492,"But there _must_ have been a boy,” insisted Marilla.",120
493,“We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.”,120
494,"“Well, she didn’t.",121
495,She brought _her_.,121
496,I asked the stationmaster.,121
497,And I had to bring her home.,121
498,"She couldn’t be left there, no matter where the mistake had come in.”",121
499,"“Well, this is a pretty piece of business!” ejaculated Marilla.",122
500,"During this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from one to the other, all the animation fading out of her face.",123
501,Suddenly she seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said.,123
502,Dropping her precious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.,123
503,“You don’t want me!” she cried.,124
504,“You don’t want me because I’m not a boy!,124
505,I might have expected it.,124
506,Nobody ever did want me.,124
507,I might have known it was all too beautiful to last.,124
508,I might have known nobody really did want me.,124
509,"Oh, what shall I do?",124
510,I’m going to burst into tears!”,124
511,Burst into tears she did.,125
512,"Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging her arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry stormily.",125
513,Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove.,125
514,Neither of them knew what to say or do.,125
515,Finally Marilla stepped lamely into the breach.,125
516,"“Well, well, there’s no need to cry so about it.”",126
517,"“Yes, there _is_ need!” The child raised her head quickly, revealing a tear-stained face and trembling lips.",127
518,"“_You_ would cry, too, if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they didn’t want you because you weren’t a boy.",127
519,"Oh, this is the most _tragical_ thing that ever happened to me!”",127
520,"Something like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse, mellowed Marilla’s grim expression.",128
521,"“Well, don’t cry any more.",129
522,We’re not going to turn you out-of-doors tonight.,129
523,You’ll have to stay here until we investigate this affair.,129
524,What’s your name?”,129
525,The child hesitated for a moment.,130
526,“Will you please call me Cordelia?” she said eagerly.,131
527,“_Call_ you Cordelia?,132
528,Is that your name?”,132
529,"“No-o-o, it’s not exactly my name, but I would love to be called Cordelia.",133
530,It’s such a perfectly elegant name.”,133
531,“I don’t know what on earth you mean.,134
532,"If Cordelia isn’t your name, what is?”",134
533,"“Anne Shirley,” reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, “but, oh, please do call me Cordelia.",135
534,"It can’t matter much to you what you call me if I’m only going to be here a little while, can it?",135
535,And Anne is such an unromantic name.”,135
536,“Unromantic fiddlesticks!” said the unsympathetic Marilla.,136
537,“Anne is a real good plain sensible name.,136
538,You’ve no need to be ashamed of it.”,136
539,"“Oh, I’m not ashamed of it,” explained Anne, “only I like Cordelia better.",137
540,"I’ve always imagined that my name was Cordelia--at least, I always have of late years.",137
541,"When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine, but I like Cordelia better now.",137
542,But if you call me Anne please call me Anne spelled with an E.”,137
543,“What difference does it make how it’s spelled?” asked Marilla with another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot.,138
544,"“Oh, it makes _such_ a difference.",139
545,It _looks_ so much nicer.,139
546,"When you hear a name pronounced can’t you always see it in your mind, just as if it was printed out?",139
547,"I can; and A-n-n looks dreadful, but A-n-n-e looks so much more distinguished.",139
548,If you’ll only call me Anne spelled with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia.”,139
549,"“Very well, then, Anne spelled with an E, can you tell us how this mistake came to be made?",140
550,We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.,140
551,Were there no boys at the asylum?”,140
552,"“Oh, yes, there was an abundance of them.",141
553,But Mrs. Spencer said _distinctly_ that you wanted a girl about eleven years old.,141
554,And the matron said she thought I would do.,141
555,You don’t know how delighted I was.,141
556,I couldn’t sleep all last night for joy.,141
557,"Oh,” she added reproachfully, turning to Matthew, “why didn’t you tell me at the station that you didn’t want me and leave me there?",141
558,If I hadn’t seen the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters it wouldn’t be so hard.”,141
559,"“What on earth does she mean?” demanded Marilla, staring at Matthew.",142
560,"“She--she’s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,”  said Matthew hastily.",143
561,"“I’m going out to put the mare in, Marilla.",143
562,Have tea ready when I come back.”,143
563,“Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you?” continued Marilla when Matthew had gone out.,144
564,“She brought Lily Jones for herself.,145
565,Lily is only five years old and she is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair.,145
566,If I was very beautiful and had nut-brown hair would you keep me?”,145
567,“No.,146
568,We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm.,146
569,A girl would be of no use to us.,146
570,Take off your hat.,146
571,I’ll lay it and your bag on the hall table.”,146
572,Anne took off her hat meekly.,147
573,Matthew came back presently and they sat down to supper.,147
574,But Anne could not eat.,147
575,In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate.,147
576,She did not really make any headway at all.,147
577,"“You’re not eating anything,” said Marilla sharply, eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming.",148
578,Anne sighed.,148
579,“I can’t.,149
580,I’m in the depths of despair.,149
581,Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?”,149
582,"“I’ve never been in the depths of despair, so I can’t say,” responded Marilla.",150
583,“Weren’t you?,151
584,"Well, did you ever try to _imagine_ you were in the depths of despair?”",151
585,"“No, I didn’t.”",152
586,“Then I don’t think you can understand what it’s like.,153
587,It’s a very uncomfortable feeling indeed.,153
588,"When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can’t swallow anything, not even if it was a chocolate caramel.",153
589,I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious.,153
590,"I’ve often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels, but I always wake up just when I’m going to eat them.",153
591,I do hope you won’t be offended because I can’t eat.,153
592,"Everything is extremely nice, but still I cannot eat.”",153
593,"“I guess she’s tired,” said Matthew, who hadn’t spoken since his return from the barn.",154
594,"“Best put her to bed, Marilla.”",154
595,Marilla had been wondering where Anne should be put to bed.,155
596,She had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy.,155
597,"But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow.",155
598,"But the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable room.",155
599,"Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne spiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as she passed.",155
600,The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.,155
601,"Marilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and turned down the bedclothes.",156
602,“I suppose you have a nightgown?” she questioned.,157
603,Anne nodded.,158
604,"“Yes, I have two.",159
605,The matron of the asylum made them for me.,159
606,They’re fearfully skimpy.,159
607,"There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so things are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours.",159
608,I hate skimpy night-dresses.,159
609,"But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that’s one consolation.”",159
610,"“Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed.",160
611,I’ll come back in a few minutes for the candle.,160
612,I daren’t trust you to put it out yourself.,160
613,You’d likely set the place on fire.”,160
614,When Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully.,161
615,The whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness.,161
616,"The floor was bare, too, except for a round braided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before.",161
617,"In one corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark, low-turned posts.",161
618,"In the other corner was the aforesaid three-cornered table adorned with a fat, red velvet pincushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin.",161
619,Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror.,161
620,"Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand.",161
621,"The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne’s bones.",161
622,"With a sob she hastily discarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head.",161
623,When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any presence save her own.,161
624,"She deliberately picked up Anne’s clothes, placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed.",162
625,"“Good night,” she said, a little awkwardly, but not unkindly.",163
626,Anne’s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness.,164
627,“How can you call it a _good_ night when you know it must be the very worst night I’ve ever had?” she said reproachfully.,165
628,Then she dived down into invisibility again.,166
629,Marilla went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes.,167
630,Matthew was smoking--a sure sign of perturbation of mind.,167
631,"He seldom smoked, for Marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit; but at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and then Marilla winked at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his emotions.",167
632,"“Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish,” she said wrathfully.",168
633,“This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves.,168
634,Richard Spencer’s folks have twisted that message somehow.,168
635,"One of us will have to drive over and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow, that’s certain.",168
636,This girl will have to be sent back to the asylum.”,168
637,"“Yes, I suppose so,” said Matthew reluctantly.",169
638,“You _suppose_ so!,170
639,Don’t you know it?”,170
640,"“Well now, she’s a real nice little thing, Marilla.",171
641,It’s kind of a pity to send her back when she’s so set on staying here.”,171
642,"“Matthew Cuthbert, you don’t mean to say you think we ought to keep her!”",172
643,Marilla’s astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head.,173
644,"“Well, now, no, I suppose not--not exactly,” stammered Matthew, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning.",174
645,“I suppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her.”,174
646,“I should say not.,175
647,What good would she be to us?”,175
648,"“We might be some good to her,” said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.",176
649,"“Matthew Cuthbert, I believe that child has bewitched you!",177
650,I can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her.”,177
651,"“Well now, she’s a real interesting little thing,” persisted Matthew.",178
652,“You should have heard her talk coming from the station.”,178
653,"“Oh, she can talk fast enough.",179
654,I saw that at once.,179
655,"It’s nothing in her favor, either.",179
656,I don’t like children who have so much to say.,179
657,I don’t want an orphan girl and if I did she isn’t the style I’d pick out.,179
658,There’s something I don’t understand about her.,179
659,"No, she’s got to be despatched straightway back to where she came from.”",179
660,"“I could hire a French boy to help me,” said Matthew, “and she’d be company for you.”",180
661,"“I’m not suffering for company,” said Marilla shortly.",181
662,“And I’m not going to keep her.”,181
663,"“Well now, it’s just as you say, of course, Marilla,” said Matthew rising and putting his pipe away.",182
664,“I’m going to bed.”,182
665,To bed went Matthew.,183
666,"And to bed, when she had put her dishes away, went Marilla, frowning most resolutely.",183
667,"And up-stairs, in the east gable, a lonely, heart-hungry, friendless child cried herself to sleep.",183
668, CHAPTER IV.,185
669,Morning at Green Gables,185
670," IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky.",186
671,For a moment she could not remember where she was.,187
672,"First came a delightful thrill, as of something very pleasant; then a horrible remembrance.",187
673,This was Green Gables and they didn’t want her because she wasn’t a boy!,187
674,"But it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of her window.",188
675,With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.,188
676,"She pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn’t been opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up.",188
677,"Anne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes glistening with delight.",189
678,"Oh, wasn’t it beautiful?",189
679,Wasn’t it a lovely place?,189
680,Suppose she wasn’t really going to stay here!,189
681,She would imagine she was.,189
682,There was scope for imagination here.,189
683,"A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen.",190
684,"On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions.",190
685,"In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind.",190
686,"Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew, upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally.",191
687,"Beyond it was a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.",191
688,"Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.",192
689,"Anne’s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily in.",193
690,"She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.",193
691,"She knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until she was startled by a hand on her shoulder.",194
692,Marilla had come in unheard by the small dreamer.,194
693,"“It’s time you were dressed,” she said curtly.",195
694,"Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be.",196
695,Anne stood up and drew a long breath.,197
696,"“Oh, isn’t it wonderful?” she said, waving her hand comprehensively at the good world outside.",198
697,"“It’s a big tree,” said Marilla, “and it blooms great, but the fruit don’t amount to much never--small and wormy.”",199
698,"“Oh, I don’t mean just the tree; of course it’s lovely--yes, it’s _radiantly_ lovely--it blooms as if it meant it--but I meant everything, the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods, the whole big dear world.",200
699,Don’t you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this?,200
700,And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here.,200
701,Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are?,200
702,They’re always laughing.,200
703,Even in winter-time I’ve heard them under the ice.,200
704,I’m so glad there’s a brook near Green Gables.,200
705,"Perhaps you think it doesn’t make any difference to me when you’re not going to keep me, but it does.",200
706,I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again.,200
707,If there wasn’t a brook I’d be _haunted_ by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one.,200
708,I’m not in the depths of despair this morning.,200
709,I never can be in the morning.,200
710,Isn’t it a splendid thing that there are mornings?,200
711,But I feel very sad.,200
712,I’ve just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever.,200
713,It was a great comfort while it lasted.,200
714,But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.”,200
715,"“You’d better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings,” said Marilla as soon as she could get a word in edgewise.",201
716,“Breakfast is waiting.,201
717,Wash your face and comb your hair.,201
718,Leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed.,201
719,Be as smart as you can.”,201
720,"Anne could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs in ten minutes’ time, with her clothes neatly on, her hair brushed and braided, her face washed, and a comfortable consciousness pervading her soul that she had fulfilled all Marilla’s requirements.",202
721,"As a matter of fact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.",202
722,"“I’m pretty hungry this morning,” she announced as she slipped into the chair Marilla placed for her.",203
723,“The world doesn’t seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night.,203
724,I’m so glad it’s a sunshiny morning.,203
725,"But I like rainy mornings real well, too.",203
726,"All sorts of mornings are interesting, don’t you think?",203
727,"You don’t know what’s going to happen through the day, and there’s so much scope for imagination.",203
728,But I’m glad it’s not rainy today because it’s easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day.,203
729,I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under.,203
730,"It’s all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically, but it’s not so nice when you really come to have them, is it?”",203
731,"“For pity’s sake hold your tongue,” said Marilla.",204
732,“You talk entirely too much for a little girl.”,204
733,"Thereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her continued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of something not exactly natural.",205
734,"Matthew also held his tongue,--but this was natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.",205
735,"As it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating mechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window.",206
736,"This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child’s body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination.",206
737,Who would want such a child about the place?,206
738,"Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things!",207
739,"Marilla felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before, and that he would go on wanting it.",207
740,That was Matthew’s way--take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency--a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out.,207
741,When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes.,208
742,“Can you wash dishes right?” asked Marilla distrustfully.,209
743,“Pretty well.,210
744,"I’m better at looking after children, though.",210
745,I’ve had so much experience at that.,210
746,It’s such a pity you haven’t any here for me to look after.”,210
747,“I don’t feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I’ve got at present.,211
748,_You’re_ problem enough in all conscience.,211
749,What’s to be done with you I don’t know.,211
750,Matthew is a most ridiculous man.”,211
751,"“I think he’s lovely,” said Anne reproachfully.",212
752,“He is so very sympathetic.,212
753,He didn’t mind how much I talked--he seemed to like it.,212
754,I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.”,212
755,"“You’re both queer enough, if that’s what you mean by kindred spirits,”  said Marilla with a sniff.",213
756,"“Yes, you may wash the dishes.",213
757,"Take plenty of hot water, and be sure you dry them well.",213
758,I’ve got enough to attend to this morning for I’ll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon and see Mrs. Spencer.,213
759,You’ll come with me and we’ll settle what’s to be done with you.,213
760,After you’ve finished the dishes go up-stairs and make your bed.”,213
761,"Anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as Marilla, who kept a sharp eye on the process, discerned.",214
762,"Later on she made her bed less successfully, for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick.",214
763,"But it was done somehow and smoothed down; and then Marilla, to get rid of her, told her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinnertime.",214
764,"Anne flew to the door, face alight, eyes glowing.",215
765,"On the very threshold she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her.",215
766,“What’s the matter now?” demanded Marilla.,216
767,"“I don’t dare go out,” said Anne, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys.",217
768,“If I can’t stay here there is no use in my loving Green Gables.,217
769,And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I’ll not be able to help loving it.,217
770,"It’s hard enough now, so I won’t make it any harder.",217
771,"I want to go out so much--everything seems to be calling to me, ‘Anne, Anne, come out to us.",217
772,"Anne, Anne, we want a playmate’--but it’s better not.",217
773,"There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there?",217
774,"And it’s so hard to keep from loving things, isn’t it?",217
775,That was why I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here.,217
776,I thought I’d have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me.,217
777,But that brief dream is over.,217
778,"I am resigned to my fate now, so I don’t think I’ll go out for fear I’ll get unresigned again.",217
779,"What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill, please?”",217
780,“That’s the apple-scented geranium.”,218
781,"“Oh, I don’t mean that sort of a name.",219
782,I mean just a name you gave it yourself.,219
783,Didn’t you give it a name?,219
784,May I give it one then?,219
785,May I call it--let me see--Bonny would do--may I call it Bonny while I’m here?,219
786,"Oh, do let me!”",219
787,"“Goodness, I don’t care.",220
788,But where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium?”,220
789,"“Oh, I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums.",221
790,It makes them seem more like people.,221
791,How do you know but that it hurts a geranium’s feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else?,221
792,You wouldn’t like to be called nothing but a woman all the time.,221
793,"Yes, I shall call it Bonny.",221
794,I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning.,221
795,I called it Snow Queen because it was so white.,221
796,"Of course, it won’t always be in blossom, but one can imagine that it is, can’t one?”",221
797,"“I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her,” muttered Marilla, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes.",222
798,"“She _is_ kind of interesting, as Matthew says.",222
799,I can feel already that I’m wondering what on earth she’ll say next.,222
800,"She’ll be casting a spell over me, too.",222
801,She’s cast it over Matthew.,222
802,That look he gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over again.,222
803,I wish he was like other men and would talk things out.,222
804,A body could answer back then and argue him into reason.,222
805,But what’s to be done with a man who just _looks?_”,222
806,"Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the sky, when Marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage.",223
807,There Marilla left her until the early dinner was on the table.,223
808,"“I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, Matthew?” said Marilla.",224
809,Matthew nodded and looked wistfully at Anne.,225
810,Marilla intercepted the look and said grimly:,225
811,“I’m going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing.,226
812,I’ll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once.,226
813,I’ll set your tea out for you and I’ll be home in time to milk the cows.”,226
814,Still Matthew said nothing and Marilla had a sense of having wasted words and breath.,227
815,There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won’t talk back--unless it is a woman who won’t.,227
816,Matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and Marilla and Anne set off.,228
817,"Matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through, he said, to nobody in particular as it seemed:",228
818,"“Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning, and I told him I guessed I’d hire him for the summer.”",229
819,"Marilla made no reply, but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with the whip that the fat mare, unused to such treatment, whizzed indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace.",230
820,"Marilla looked back once as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating Matthew leaning over the gate, looking wistfully after them.",230
821, CHAPTER V. Anne’s History,232
822," DO you know,” said Anne confidentially, “I’ve made up my mind to enjoy this drive.",233
823,It’s been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.,233
824,"Of course, you must make it up _firmly_.",233
825,I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we’re having our drive.,233
826,I’m just going to think about the drive.,233
827,"Oh, look, there’s one little early wild rose out!",233
828,Isn’t it lovely?,233
829,Don’t you think it must be glad to be a rose?,233
830,Wouldn’t it be nice if roses could talk?,233
831,I’m sure they could tell us such lovely things.,233
832,And isn’t pink the most bewitching color in the world?,233
833,"I love it, but I can’t wear it.",233
834,"Redheaded people can’t wear pink, not even in imagination.",233
835,"Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?”",233
836,"“No, I don’t know as I ever did,” said Marilla mercilessly, “and I shouldn’t think it likely to happen in your case either.”",234
837,Anne sighed.,235
838,"“Well, that is another hope gone.",236
839,"‘My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.’ That’s a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I’m disappointed in anything.”",236
840,"“I don’t see where the comforting comes in myself,” said Marilla.",237
841,"“Why, because it sounds so nice and romantic, just as if I were a heroine in a book, you know.",238
842,"I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine, isn’t it?",238
843,I’m rather glad I have one.,238
844,Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters today?”,238
845,"“We’re not going over Barry’s pond, if that’s what you mean by your Lake of Shining Waters.",239
846,We’re going by the shore road.”,239
847,"“Shore road sounds nice,” said Anne dreamily.",240
848,“Is it as nice as it sounds?,240
849,"Just when you said ‘shore road’ I saw it in a picture in my mind, as quick as that!",240
850,"And White Sands is a pretty name, too; but I don’t like it as well as Avonlea.",240
851,Avonlea is a lovely name.,240
852,It just sounds like music.,240
853,How far is it to White Sands?”,240
854,“It’s five miles; and as you’re evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.”,241
855,"“Oh, what I _know_ about myself isn’t really worth telling,” said Anne eagerly.",242
856,“If you’ll only let me tell you what I _imagine_ about myself you’ll think it ever so much more interesting.”,242
857,"“No, I don’t want any of your imaginings.",243
858,Just you stick to bald facts.,243
859,Begin at the beginning.,243
860,Where were you born and how old are you?”,243
861,"“I was eleven last March,” said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh.",244
862,"“And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.",244
863,"My father’s name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School.",244
864,My mother’s name was Bertha Shirley.,244
865,Aren’t Walter and Bertha lovely names?,244
866,I’m so glad my parents had nice names.,244
867,"It would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah, wouldn’t it?”",244
868,"“I guess it doesn’t matter what a person’s name is as long as he behaves himself,” said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral.",245
869,"“Well, I don’t know.” Anne looked thoughtful.",246
870,"“I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I’ve never been able to believe it.",246
871,I don’t believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.,246
872,I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I’m sure it would have been a cross.,246
873,"Well, my mother was a teacher in the High School, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course.",246
874,A husband was enough responsibility.,246
875,Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice.,246
876,They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke.,246
877,"I’ve never seen that house, but I’ve imagined it thousands of times.",246
878,I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate.,246
879,"Yes, and muslin curtains in all the windows.",246
880,Muslin curtains give a house such an air.,246
881,I was born in that house.,246
882,"Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful.",246
883,"I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn’t you?",246
884,"I’m glad she was satisfied with me anyhow; I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her--because she didn’t live very long after that, you see.",246
885,She died of fever when I was just three months old.,246
886,I do wish she’d lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother.,246
887,"I think it would be so sweet to say ‘mother,’ don’t you?",246
888,And father died four days afterwards from fever too.,246
889,"That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits’ end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me.",246
890,"You see, nobody wanted me even then.",246
891,It seems to be my fate.,246
892,Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn’t any relatives living.,246
893,"Finally Mrs. Thomas said she’d take me, though she was poor and had a drunken husband.",246
894,She brought me up by hand.,246
895,Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people?,246
896,Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.,246
897,“Mr.,247
898,"and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I lived with them until I was eight years old.",247
899,I helped look after the Thomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell you they took a lot of looking after.,247
900,"Then Mr. Thomas was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the children, but she didn’t want me.",247
901,"Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits’ end, so she said, what to do with me.",247
902,"Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came down and said she’d take me, seeing I was handy with children, and I went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps.",247
903,It was a very lonesome place.,247
904,I’m sure I could never have lived there if I hadn’t had an imagination.,247
905,"Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children.",247
906,She had twins three times.,247
907,"I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is _too much_.",247
908,"I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last pair came.",247
909,I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.,247
910,"“I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping.",248
911,She divided her children among her relatives and went to the States.,248
912,"I had to go to the asylum at Hopeton, because nobody would take me.",248
913,"They didn’t want me at the asylum, either; they said they were overcrowded as it was.",248
914,But they had to take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.”,248
915,"Anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time.",249
916,Evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her.,249
917,"“Did you ever go to school?” demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare down the shore road.",250
918,“Not a great deal.,251
919,I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs. Thomas.,251
920,"When I went up river we were so far from a school that I couldn’t walk it in winter and there was vacation in summer, so I could only go in the spring and fall.",251
921,But of course I went while I was at the asylum.,251
922,"I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart--‘The Battle of Hohenlinden’ and ‘Edinburgh after Flodden,’ and ‘Bingen on the Rhine,’ and lots of the ‘Lady of the Lake’ and most of ‘The Seasons,’ by James Thompson.",251
923,Don’t you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back?,251
924,There is a piece in the Fifth Reader--‘The Downfall of Poland’--that is just full of thrills.,251
925,"Of course, I wasn’t in the Fifth Reader--I was only in the Fourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.”",251
926,"“Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?” asked Marilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.",252
927,"“O-o-o-h,” faltered Anne.",253
928,Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow.,253
929,"“Oh, they _meant_ to be--I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible.",253
930,"And when people mean to be good to you, you don’t mind very much when they’re not quite--always.",253
931,"They had a good deal to worry them, you know.",253
932,"It’s very trying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession, don’t you think?",253
933,But I feel sure they meant to be good to me.”,253
934,Marilla asked no more questions.,254
935,Anne gave herself up to a silent rapture over the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly while she pondered deeply.,254
936,Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child.,254
937,"What a starved, unloved life she had had--a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between the lines of Anne’s history and divine the truth.",254
938,No wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home.,254
939,It was a pity she had to be sent back.,254
940,"What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew’s unaccountable whim and let her stay?",254
941,"He was set on it; and the child seemed a nice, teachable little thing.",254
942,"“She’s got too much to say,” thought Marilla, “but she might be trained out of that.",255
943,And there’s nothing rude or slangy in what she does say.,255
944,She’s ladylike.,255
945,It’s likely her people were nice folks.”,255
946,"The shore road was “woodsy and wild and lonesome.” On the right hand, scrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the gulf winds, grew thickly.",256
947,"On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her.",256
948,"Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.",256
949,"“Isn’t the sea wonderful?” said Anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed silence.",257
950,"“Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.",257
951,"I enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children all the time.",257
952,I lived it over in happy dreams for years.,257
953,But this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore.,257
954,Aren’t those gulls splendid?,257
955,Would you like to be a gull?,257
956,"I think I would--that is, if I couldn’t be a human girl.",257
957,Don’t you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day; and then at night to fly back to one’s nest?,257
958,"Oh, I can just imagine myself doing it.",257
959,"What big house is that just ahead, please?”",257
960,“That’s the White Sands Hotel.,258
961,"Mr. Kirke runs it, but the season hasn’t begun yet.",258
962,There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer.,258
963,They think this shore is just about right.”,258
964,"“I was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer’s place,” said Anne mournfully.",259
965,“I don’t want to get there.,259
966,"Somehow, it will seem like the end of everything.”",259
967, CHAPTER VI.,261
968,Marilla Makes Up Her Mind,261
969," GET there they did, however, in due season.",262
970,"Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove, and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her benevolent face.",262
971,"“Dear, dear,” she exclaimed, “you’re the last folks I was looking for today, but I’m real glad to see you.",263
972,You’ll put your horse in?,263
973,"And how are you, Anne?”",263
974,"“I’m as well as can be expected, thank you,” said Anne smilelessly.",264
975,A blight seemed to have descended on her.,264
976,"“I suppose we’ll stay a little while to rest the mare,” said Marilla, “but I promised Matthew I’d be home early.",265
977,"The fact is, Mrs. Spencer, there’s been a queer mistake somewhere, and I’ve come over to see where it is.",265
978,"We sent word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the asylum.",265
979,We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years old.”,265
980,"“Marilla Cuthbert, you don’t say so!” said Mrs. Spencer in distress.",266
981,"“Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl--didn’t she, Flora Jane?” appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps.",266
982,"“She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,” corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.",267
983,"“I’m dreadful sorry,” said Mrs. Spencer.",268
984,"“It’s too bad; but it certainly wasn’t my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert.",268
985,I did the best I could and I thought I was following your instructions.,268
986,Nancy is a terrible flighty thing.,268
987,I’ve often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.”,268
988,"“It was our own fault,” said Marilla resignedly.",269
989,“We should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion.,269
990,"Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the only thing to do now is to set it right.",269
991,Can we send the child back to the asylum?,269
992,"I suppose they’ll take her back, won’t they?”",269
993,"“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, “but I don’t think it will be necessary to send her back.",270
994,"Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she’d sent by me for a little girl to help her.",270
995,"Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know, and she finds it hard to get help.",270
996,Anne will be the very girl for her.,270
997,I call it positively providential.”,270
998,Marilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with the matter.,271
999,"Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.",271
1000,"She knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced woman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones.",272
1001,But she had heard of her.,272
1002,"“A terrible worker and driver,” Mrs. Peter was said to be; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children.",272
1003,Marilla felt a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her tender mercies.,272
1004,"“Well, I’ll go in and we’ll talk the matter over,” she said.",273
1005,"“And if there isn’t Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!” exclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the parlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been strained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed.",274
1006,"“That is real lucky, for we can settle the matter right away.",274
1007,"Take the armchair, Miss Cuthbert.",274
1008,"Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don’t wriggle.",274
1009,Let me take your hats.,274
1010,"Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on.",274
1011,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Blewett.",274
1012,We were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along.,274
1013,Let me introduce you two ladies.,274
1014,"Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert.",274
1015,Please excuse me for just a moment.,274
1016,I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.”,274
1017,"Mrs. Spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds.",275
1018,"Anne, sitting mutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared at Mrs. Blewett as one fascinated.",275
1019,"Was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman?",275
1020,She felt a lump coming up in her throat and her eyes smarted painfully.,275
1021,"She was beginning to be afraid she couldn’t keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed and beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical, mental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.",275
1022,"“It seems there’s been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,”  she said.",276
1023,“I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt.,276
1024,I was certainly told so.,276
1025,But it seems it was a boy they wanted.,276
1026,"So if you’re still of the same mind you were yesterday, I think she’ll be just the thing for you.”",276
1027,Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.,277
1028,“How old are you and what’s your name?” she demanded.,278
1029,"“Anne Shirley,” faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof, “and I’m eleven years old.”",279
1030,“Humph!,280
1031,You don’t look as if there was much to you.,280
1032,But you’re wiry.,280
1033,I don’t know but the wiry ones are the best after all.,280
1034,"Well, if I take you you’ll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.",280
1035,"I’ll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that.",280
1036,"Yes, I suppose I might as well take her off your hands, Miss Cuthbert.",280
1037,"The baby’s awful fractious, and I’m clean worn out attending to him.",280
1038,If you like I can take her right home now.”,280
1039,Marilla looked at Anne and softened at sight of the child’s pale face with its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.,281
1040,"Marilla felt an uncomfortable conviction that, if she denied the appeal of that look, it would haunt her to her dying day.",281
1041,"Moreover, she did not fancy Mrs. Blewett.",281
1042,"To hand a sensitive, “highstrung” child over to such a woman!",281
1043,"No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!",281
1044,"“Well, I don’t know,” she said slowly.",282
1045,“I didn’t say that Matthew and I had absolutely decided that we wouldn’t keep her.,282
1046,"In fact, I may say that Matthew is disposed to keep her.",282
1047,I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred.,282
1048,I think I’d better take her home again and talk it over with Matthew.,282
1049,I feel that I oughtn’t to decide on anything without consulting him.,282
1050,If we make up our mind not to keep her we’ll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night.,282
1051,If we don’t you may know that she is going to stay with us.,282
1052,"Will that suit you, Mrs. Blewett?”",282
1053,"“I suppose it’ll have to,” said Mrs. Blewett ungraciously.",283
1054,During Marilla’s speech a sunrise had been dawning on Anne’s face.,284
1055,First the look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope; her eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars.,284
1056,"The child was quite transfigured; and, a moment later, when Mrs. Spencer and Mrs. Blewett went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow, she sprang up and flew across the room to Marilla.",284
1057,"“Oh, Miss Cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at Green Gables?” she said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility.",285
1058,“Did you really say it?,285
1059,Or did I only imagine that you did?”,285
1060,"“I think you’d better learn to control that imagination of yours, Anne, if you can’t distinguish between what is real and what isn’t,” said Marilla crossly.",286
1061,"“Yes, you did hear me say just that and no more.",286
1062,It isn’t decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take you after all.,286
1063,She certainly needs you much more than I do.”,286
1064,"“I’d rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her,” said Anne passionately.",287
1065,“She looks exactly like a--like a gimlet.”,287
1066,Marilla smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne must be reproved for such a speech.,288
1067,"“A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger,” she said severely.",289
1068,“Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should.”,289
1069,"“I’ll try to do and be anything you want me, if you’ll only keep me,”  said Anne, returning meekly to her ottoman.",290
1070,When they arrived back at Green Gables that evening Matthew met them in the lane.,291
1071,Marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed his motive.,291
1072,She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had at least brought Anne back with her.,291
1073,"But she said nothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows.",291
1074,Then she briefly told him Anne’s history and the result of the interview with Mrs. Spencer.,291
1075,"“I wouldn’t give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman,” said Matthew with unusual vim.",292
1076,"“I don’t fancy her style myself,” admitted Marilla, “but it’s that or keeping her ourselves, Matthew.",293
1077,"And, since you seem to want her, I suppose I’m willing--or have to be.",293
1078,I’ve been thinking over the idea until I’ve got kind of used to it.,293
1079,It seems a sort of duty.,293
1080,"I’ve never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I’ll make a terrible mess of it.",293
1081,But I’ll do my best.,293
1082,"So far as I’m concerned, Matthew, she may stay.”",293
1083,Matthew’s shy face was a glow of delight.,294
1084,"“Well now, I reckoned you’d come to see it in that light, Marilla,” he said.",295
1085,“She’s such an interesting little thing.”,295
1086,"“It’d be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing,” retorted Marilla, “but I’ll make it my business to see she’s trained to be that.",296
1087,"And mind, Matthew, you’re not to go interfering with my methods.",296
1088,"Perhaps an old maid doesn’t know much about bringing up a child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor.",296
1089,So you just leave me to manage her.,296
1090,When I fail it’ll be time enough to put your oar in.”,296
1091,"“There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,” said Matthew reassuringly.",297
1092,“Only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling her.,297
1093,I kind of think she’s one of the sort you can do anything with if you only get her to love you.”,297
1094,"Marilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew’s opinions concerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the pails.",298
1095,"“I won’t tell her tonight that she can stay,” she reflected, as she strained the milk into the creamers.",299
1096,“She’d be so excited that she wouldn’t sleep a wink.,299
1097,"Marilla Cuthbert, you’re fairly in for it.",299
1098,Did you ever suppose you’d see the day when you’d be adopting an orphan girl?,299
1099,"It’s surprising enough; but not so surprising as that Matthew should be at the bottom of it, him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls.",299
1100,"Anyhow, we’ve decided on the experiment and goodness only knows what will come of it.”",299
1101, CHAPTER VII.,301
1102,Anne Says Her Prayers,301
1103, WHEN Marilla took Anne up to bed that night she said stiffly:,302
1104,"“Now, Anne, I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off.",303
1105,"That is a very untidy habit, and I can’t allow it at all.",303
1106,As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair.,303
1107,I haven’t any use at all for little girls who aren’t neat.”,303
1108,"“I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn’t think about my clothes at all,” said Anne.",304
1109,“I’ll fold them nicely tonight.,304
1110,They always made us do that at the asylum.,304
1111,"Half the time, though, I’d forget, I’d be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.”",304
1112,"“You’ll have to remember a little better if you stay here,” admonished Marilla.",305
1113,"“There, that looks something like.",305
1114,Say your prayers now and get into bed.”,305
1115,"“I never say any prayers,” announced Anne.",306
1116,Marilla looked horrified astonishment.,307
1117,"“Why, Anne, what do you mean?",308
1118,Were you never taught to say your prayers?,308
1119,God always wants little girls to say their prayers.,308
1120,"Don’t you know who God is, Anne?”",308
1121,"“‘God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,’” responded Anne promptly and glibly.",309
1122,Marilla looked rather relieved.,310
1123,"“So you do know something then, thank goodness!",311
1124,You’re not quite a heathen.,311
1125,Where did you learn that?”,311
1126,"“Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school.",312
1127,They made us learn the whole catechism.,312
1128,I liked it pretty well.,312
1129,There’s something splendid about some of the words.,312
1130,"‘Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.’ Isn’t that grand?",312
1131,It has such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing.,312
1132,"You couldn’t quite call it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn’t it?”",312
1133,"“We’re not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your prayers.",313
1134,Don’t you know it’s a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night?,313
1135,I’m afraid you are a very bad little girl.”,313
1136,"“You’d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,” said Anne reproachfully.",314
1137,“People who haven’t red hair don’t know what trouble is.,314
1138,"Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I’ve never cared about Him since.",314
1139,And anyhow I’d always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers.,314
1140,People who have to look after twins can’t be expected to say their prayers.,314
1141,"Now, do you honestly think they can?”",314
1142,Marilla decided that Anne’s religious training must be begun at once.,315
1143,Plainly there was no time to be lost.,315
1144,"“You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.”",316
1145,"“Why, of course, if you want me to,” assented Anne cheerfully.",317
1146,“I’d do anything to oblige you.,317
1147,But you’ll have to tell me what to say for this once.,317
1148,After I get into bed I’ll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always.,317
1149,"I believe that it will be quite interesting, now that I come to think of it.”",317
1150,"“You must kneel down,” said Marilla in embarrassment.",318
1151,Anne knelt at Marilla’s knee and looked up gravely.,319
1152,“Why must people kneel down to pray?,320
1153,If I really wanted to pray I’ll tell you what I’d do.,320
1154,"I’d go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep, deep woods, and I’d look up into the sky--up--up--up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness.",320
1155,And then I’d just _feel_ a prayer.,320
1156,"Well, I’m ready.",320
1157,What am I to say?”,320
1158,Marilla felt more embarrassed than ever.,321
1159,"She had intended to teach Anne the childish classic, “Now I lay me down to sleep.” But she had, as I have told you, the glimmerings of a sense of humor--which is simply another name for a sense of the fitness of things; and it suddenly occurred to her that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood lisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing about God’s love, since she had never had it translated to her through the medium of human love.",321
1160,"“You’re old enough to pray for yourself, Anne,” she said finally.",322
1161,“Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you want.”,322
1162,"“Well, I’ll do my best,” promised Anne, burying her face in Marilla’s lap.",323
1163,"“Gracious heavenly Father--that’s the way the ministers say it in church, so I suppose it’s all right in private prayer, isn’t it?” she interjected, lifting her head for a moment.",323
1164,"“Gracious heavenly Father, I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny and the Snow Queen.",323
1165,I’m really extremely grateful for them.,323
1166,And that’s all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for.,323
1167,"As for the things I want, they’re so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all, so I will only mention the two most important.",323
1168,Please let me stay at Green Gables; and please let me be good-looking when I grow up.,323
1169,"I remain,",323
1170,"                    “Yours respectfully,                        Anne Shirley.",324
1171,"“There, did I do all right?” she asked eagerly, getting up.",325
1172,“I could have made it much more flowery if I’d had a little more time to think it over.”,325
1173,"Poor Marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of Anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition.",326
1174,"She tucked the child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne called her back.",326
1175,“I’ve just thought of it now.,327
1176,"I should have said ‘Amen’ in place of ‘yours respectfully,’ shouldn’t I?--the way the ministers do.",327
1177,"I’d forgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so I put in the other.",327
1178,Do you suppose it will make any difference?”,327
1179,"“I--I don’t suppose it will,” said Marilla.",328
1180,“Go to sleep now like a good child.,328
1181,Good night.”,328
1182,"“I can say good night tonight with a clear conscience,” said Anne, cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.",329
1183,"Marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table, and glared at Matthew.",330
1184,"“Matthew Cuthbert, it’s about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something.",331
1185,She’s next door to a perfect heathen.,331
1186,Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight?,331
1187,"I’ll send to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series, that’s what I’ll do.",331
1188,And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get some suitable clothes made for her.,331
1189,I foresee that I shall have my hands full.,331
1190,"Well, well, we can’t get through this world without our share of trouble.",331
1191,"I’ve had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time has come at last and I suppose I’ll just have to make the best of it.”",331
1192, CHAPTER VIII.,333
1193,Anne’s Bringing-up Is Begun,333
1194," FOR reasons best known to herself, Marilla did not tell Anne that she was to stay at Green Gables until the next afternoon.",334
1195,During the forenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did them.,334
1196,"By noon she had concluded that Anne was smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.",334
1197,When Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted Marilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the worst.,335
1198,Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her face flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she clasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:,335
1199,"“Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won’t you tell me if you are going to send me away or not?",336
1200,"I’ve tried to be patient all the morning, but I really feel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer.",336
1201,It’s a dreadful feeling.,336
1202,Please tell me.”,336
1203,"“You haven’t scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do,” said Marilla immovably.",337
1204,"“Just go and do it before you ask any more questions, Anne.”",337
1205,Anne went and attended to the dishcloth.,338
1206,Then she returned to Marilla and fastened imploring eyes on the latter’s face.,338
1207,"“Well,” said Marilla, unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, “I suppose I might as well tell you.",339
1208,"Matthew and I have decided to keep you--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful.",339
1209,"Why, child, whatever is the matter?”",339
1210,"“I’m crying,” said Anne in a tone of bewilderment.",340
1211,“I can’t think why.,340
1212,I’m glad as glad can be.,340
1213,"Oh, _glad_ doesn’t seem the right word at all.",340
1214,I was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this!,340
1215,"Oh, it’s something more than glad.",340
1216,I’m so happy.,340
1217,I’ll try to be so good.,340
1218,"It will be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was desperately wicked.",340
1219,"However, I’ll do my very best.",340
1220,But can you tell me why I’m crying?”,340
1221,"“I suppose it’s because you’re all excited and worked up,” said Marilla disapprovingly.",341
1222,“Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.,341
1223,I’m afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily.,341
1224,"Yes, you can stay here and we will try to do right by you.",341
1225,You must go to school; but it’s only a fortnight till vacation so it isn’t worth while for you to start before it opens again in September.”,341
1226,“What am I to call you?” asked Anne.,342
1227,“Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert?,342
1228,Can I call you Aunt Marilla?”,342
1229,“No; you’ll call me just plain Marilla.,343
1230,I’m not used to being called Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.”,343
1231,"“It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,” protested Anne.",344
1232,“I guess there’ll be nothing disrespectful in it if you’re careful to speak respectfully.,345
1233,"Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me Marilla except the minister.",345
1234,He says Miss Cuthbert--when he thinks of it.”,345
1235,"“I’d love to call you Aunt Marilla,” said Anne wistfully.",346
1236,“I’ve never had an aunt or any relation at all--not even a grandmother.,346
1237,It would make me feel as if I really belonged to you.,346
1238,Can’t I call you Aunt Marilla?”,346
1239,“No.,347
1240,I’m not your aunt and I don’t believe in calling people names that don’t belong to them.”,347
1241,“But we could imagine you were my aunt.”,348
1242,"“I couldn’t,” said Marilla grimly.",349
1243,“Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?” asked Anne wide-eyed.,350
1244,“No.”,351
1245,“Oh!” Anne drew a long breath.,352
1246,"“Oh, Miss--Marilla, how much you miss!”",352
1247,"“I don’t believe in imagining things different from what they really are,” retorted Marilla.",353
1248,“When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn’t mean for us to imagine them away.,353
1249,And that reminds me.,353
1250,"Go into the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don’t let any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that’s on the mantelpiece.",353
1251,The Lord’s Prayer is on it and you’ll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart.,353
1252,There’s to be no more of such praying as I heard last night.”,353
1253,"“I suppose I was very awkward,” said Anne apologetically, “but then, you see, I’d never had any practice.",354
1254,"You couldn’t really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried, could you?",354
1255,"I thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.",354
1256,It was nearly as long as a minister’s and so poetical.,354
1257,But would you believe it?,354
1258,I couldn’t remember one word when I woke up this morning.,354
1259,And I’m afraid I’ll never be able to think out another one as good.,354
1260,"Somehow, things never are so good when they’re thought out a second time.",354
1261,Have you ever noticed that?”,354
1262,"“Here is something for you to notice, Anne.",355
1263,When I tell you to do a thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and discourse about it.,355
1264,Just you go and do as I bid you.”,355
1265,Anne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed to return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting and marched after her with a grim expression.,356
1266,"She found Anne standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows, with her eyes astar with dreams.",356
1267,The white and green light strained through apple-trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance.,356
1268,"“Anne, whatever are you thinking of?” demanded Marilla sharply.",357
1269,Anne came back to earth with a start.,358
1270,"“That,” she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo entitled, “Christ Blessing Little Children”--“and I was just imagining I was one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she didn’t belong to anybody, like me.",359
1271,"She looks lonely and sad, don’t you think?",359
1272,I guess she hadn’t any father or mother of her own.,359
1273,"But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would notice her--except Him.",359
1274,I’m sure I know just how she felt.,359
1275,"Her heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I asked you if I could stay.",359
1276,She was afraid He mightn’t notice her.,359
1277,"But it’s likely He did, don’t you think?",359
1278,"I’ve been trying to imagine it all out--her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close to Him; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and oh, such a thrill of joy as would run over her!",359
1279,But I wish the artist hadn’t painted Him so sorrowful-looking.,359
1280,"All His pictures are like that, if you’ve noticed.",359
1281,But I don’t believe He could really have looked so sad or the children would have been afraid of Him.”,359
1282,"“Anne,” said Marilla, wondering why she had not broken into this speech long before, “you shouldn’t talk that way.",360
1283,It’s irreverent--positively irreverent.”,360
1284,Anne’s eyes marveled.,361
1285,"“Why, I felt just as reverent as could be.",362
1286,I’m sure I didn’t mean to be irreverent.”,362
1287,"“Well, I don’t suppose you did--but it doesn’t sound right to talk so familiarly about such things.",363
1288,"And another thing, Anne, when I send you after something you’re to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures.",363
1289,Remember that.,363
1290,Take that card and come right to the kitchen.,363
1291,"Now, sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart.”",363
1292,"Anne set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought in to decorate the dinner table--Marilla had eyed that decoration askance, but had said nothing--propped her chin on her hands, and fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes.",364
1293,"“I like this,” she announced at length.",365
1294,“It’s beautiful.,365
1295,I’ve heard it before--I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday-school say it over once.,365
1296,But I didn’t like it then.,365
1297,He had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully.,365
1298,I really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty.,365
1299,"This isn’t poetry, but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does.",365
1300,"‘Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.’ That is just like a line of music.",365
1301,"Oh, I’m so glad you thought of making me learn this, Miss--Marilla.”",365
1302,"“Well, learn it and hold your tongue,” said Marilla shortly.",366
1303,"Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments longer.",367
1304,"“Marilla,” she demanded presently, “do you think that I shall ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea?”",368
1305,“A--a what kind of friend?”,369
1306,"“A bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul.",370
1307,I’ve dreamed of meeting her all my life.,370
1308,"I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too.",370
1309,Do you think it’s possible?”,370
1310,“Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she’s about your age.,371
1311,"She’s a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home.",371
1312,She’s visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now.,371
1313,"You’ll have to be careful how you behave yourself, though.",371
1314,Mrs. Barry is a very particular woman.,371
1315,She won’t let Diana play with any little girl who isn’t nice and good.”,371
1316,"Anne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with interest.",372
1317,“What is Diana like?,373
1318,"Her hair isn’t red, is it?",373
1319,"Oh, I hope not.",373
1320,"It’s bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn’t endure it in a bosom friend.”",373
1321,“Diana is a very pretty little girl.,374
1322,She has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks.,374
1323,"And she is good and smart, which is better than being pretty.”",374
1324,"Marilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was being brought up.",375
1325,But Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it.,376
1326,"“Oh, I’m so glad she’s pretty.",377
1327,Next to being beautiful oneself--and that’s impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend.,377
1328,When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors.,377
1329,There weren’t any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept her best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to keep.,377
1330,One of the doors was broken.,377
1331,Mr. Thomas smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated.,377
1332,But the other was whole and I used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it.,377
1333,"I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate.",377
1334,"I used to talk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.",377
1335,Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life.,377
1336,"We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice lived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas’ shelves of preserves and china.",377
1337,"And then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have lived there happy for ever after.",377
1338,When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice.,377
1339,"She felt it dreadfully, too, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye through the bookcase door.",377
1340,There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond’s.,377
1341,"But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there.",377
1342,"It echoed back every word you said, even if you didn’t talk a bit loud.",377
1343,"So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you know.",377
1344,"The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta, and oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones.",377
1345,"I had become so attached to her that I hadn’t the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination there.”",377
1346,"“I think it’s just as well there wasn’t,” said Marilla drily.",378
1347,“I don’t approve of such goings-on.,378
1348,You seem to half believe your own imaginations.,378
1349,It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head.,378
1350,But don’t let Mrs. Barry hear you talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she’ll think you tell stories.”,378
1351,"“Oh, I won’t.",379
1352,I couldn’t talk of them to everybody--their memories are too sacred for that.,379
1353,But I thought I’d like to have you know about them.,379
1354,"Oh, look, here’s a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom.",379
1355,Just think what a lovely place to live--in an apple blossom!,379
1356,Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it.,379
1357,If I wasn’t a human girl I think I’d like to be a bee and live among the flowers.”,379
1358,"“Yesterday you wanted to be a sea-gull,” sniffed Marilla.",380
1359,“I think you are very fickle minded.,380
1360,I told you to learn that prayer and not talk.,380
1361,But it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you’ve got anybody that will listen to you.,380
1362,So go up to your room and learn it.”,380
1363,"“Oh, I know it pretty nearly all now--all but just the last line.”",381
1364,"“Well, never mind, do as I tell you.",382
1365,"Go to your room and finish learning it well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.”",382
1366,“Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?” pleaded Anne.,383
1367,“No; you don’t want your room cluttered up with flowers.,384
1368,You should have left them on the tree in the first place.”,384
1369,"“I did feel a little that way, too,” said Anne.",385
1370,“I kind of felt I shouldn’t shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn’t want to be picked if I were an apple blossom.,385
1371,But the temptation was _irresistible_.,385
1372,What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation?”,385
1373,"“Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?”",386
1374,"Anne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the window.",387
1375,“There--I know this prayer.,388
1376,I learned that last sentence coming upstairs.,388
1377,Now I’m going to imagine things into this room so that they’ll always stay imagined.,388
1378,The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows.,388
1379,The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry.,388
1380,The furniture is mahogany.,388
1381,"I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound _so_ luxurious.",388
1382,"This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it.",388
1383,I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall.,388
1384,"I am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair.",388
1385,My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor.,388
1386,My name is the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald.,388
1387,"No, it isn’t--I can’t make _that_ seem real.”",388
1388,She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it.,389
1389,Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.,389
1390,"“You’re only Anne of Green Gables,” she said earnestly, “and I see you, just as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I’m the Lady Cordelia.",390
1391,"But it’s a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular, isn’t it?”",390
1392,"She bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook herself to the open window.",391
1393," “Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon.",392
1394,"And good afternoon, dear birches down in the hollow.",392
1395,"And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill.",392
1396,I wonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend.,392
1397,"I hope she will, and I shall love her very much.",392
1398,But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta.,392
1399,"They would feel so hurt if I did and I’d hate to hurt anybody’s feelings, even a little bookcase girl’s or a little echo girl’s.",392
1400,I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day.”,392
1401,"Anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams.",393
1402, CHAPTER IX.,395
1403,Mrs. Rachel Lynde Is Properly Horrified,395
1404, ANNE had been a fortnight at Green Gables before Mrs. Lynde arrived to inspect her.,396
1405,"Mrs. Rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this.",396
1406,A severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady to her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to Green Gables.,396
1407,"Mrs. Rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for people who were; but grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on earth and could only be interpreted as one of the special visitations of Providence.",396
1408,"As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot out-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables, bursting with curiosity to see Matthew and Marilla’s orphan, concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea.",396
1409,Anne had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight.,397
1410,Already she was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place.,397
1411,"She had discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of woodland; and she had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge, fir coppice and wild cherry arch, corners thick with fern, and branching byways of maple and mountain ash.",397
1412,"She had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook.",398
1413,"That bridge led Anne’s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where perpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and spruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate “June bells,”  those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial starflowers, like the spirits of last year’s blossoms.",399
1414,Gossamers glimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to utter friendly speech.,399
1415,"All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which she was allowed for play, and Anne talked Matthew and Marilla half-deaf over her discoveries.",400
1416,"Not that Matthew complained, to be sure; he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face; Marilla permitted the “chatter” until she found herself becoming too interested in it, whereupon she always promptly quenched Anne by a curt command to hold her tongue.",400
1417,"Anne was out in the orchard when Mrs. Rachel came, wandering at her own sweet will through the lush, tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness fully over, describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that Marilla thought even grippe must bring its compensations.",401
1418,When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the real reason of her call.,401
1419,“I’ve been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.”,402
1420,"“I don’t suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,” said Marilla.",403
1421,“I’m getting over my surprise now.”,403
1422,"“It was too bad there was such a mistake,” said Mrs. Rachel sympathetically.",404
1423,“Couldn’t you have sent her back?”,404
1424,"“I suppose we could, but we decided not to.",405
1425,Matthew took a fancy to her.,405
1426,And I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults.,405
1427,The house seems a different place already.,405
1428,She’s a real bright little thing.”,405
1429,"Marilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she read disapproval in Mrs. Rachel’s expression.",406
1430,"“It’s a great responsibility you’ve taken on yourself,” said that lady gloomily, “especially when you’ve never had any experience with children.",407
1431,"You don’t know much about her or her real disposition, I suppose, and there’s no guessing how a child like that will turn out.",407
1432,"But I don’t want to discourage you I’m sure, Marilla.”",407
1433,"“I’m not feeling discouraged,” was Marilla’s dry response, “when I make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up.",408
1434,I suppose you’d like to see Anne.,408
1435,I’ll call her in.”,408
1436,"Anne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of her orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside the door.",409
1437,"She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long.",409
1438,Her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.,409
1439,"“Well, they didn’t pick you for your looks, that’s sure and certain,”  was Mrs. Rachel Lynde’s emphatic comment.",410
1440,Mrs. Rachel was one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind without fear or favor.,410
1441,"“She’s terrible skinny and homely, Marilla.",410
1442,"Come here, child, and let me have a look at you.",410
1443,"Lawful heart, did any one ever see such freckles?",410
1444,And hair as red as carrots!,410
1445,"Come here, child, I say.”",410
1446,"Anne “came there,” but not exactly as Mrs. Rachel expected.",411
1447,"With one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before Mrs. Rachel, her face scarlet with anger, her lips quivering, and her whole slender form trembling from head to foot.",411
1448,"“I hate you,” she cried in a choked voice, stamping her foot on the floor.",412
1449,“I hate you--I hate you--I hate you--” a louder stamp with each assertion of hatred.,412
1450,“How dare you call me skinny and ugly?,412
1451,How dare you say I’m freckled and redheaded?,412
1452,"You are a rude, impolite, unfeeling woman!”",412
1453,“Anne!” exclaimed Marilla in consternation.,413
1454,"But Anne continued to face Mrs. Rachel undauntedly, head up, eyes blazing, hands clenched, passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere.",414
1455,“How dare you say such things about me?” she repeated vehemently.,415
1456,“How would you like to have such things said about you?,415
1457,How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably hadn’t a spark of imagination in you?,415
1458,I don’t care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so!,415
1459,I hope I hurt them.,415
1460,You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by Mrs. Thomas’ intoxicated husband.,415
1461,"And I’ll _never_ forgive you for it, never, never!”",415
1462,Stamp!,416
1463,Stamp!,416
1464,“Did anybody ever see such a temper!” exclaimed the horrified Mrs. Rachel.,417
1465,"“Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up,” said Marilla, recovering her powers of speech with difficulty.",418
1466,"Anne, bursting into tears, rushed to the hall door, slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy, and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind.",419
1467,A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence.,419
1468,"“Well, I don’t envy you your job bringing _that_ up, Marilla,” said Mrs. Rachel with unspeakable solemnity.",420
1469,Marilla opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation.,421
1470,What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards.,421
1471,"“You shouldn’t have twitted her about her looks, Rachel.”",422
1472,"“Marilla Cuthbert, you don’t mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we’ve just seen?” demanded Mrs. Rachel indignantly.",423
1473,"“No,” said Marilla slowly, “I’m not trying to excuse her.",424
1474,She’s been very naughty and I’ll have to give her a talking to about it.,424
1475,But we must make allowances for her.,424
1476,She’s never been taught what is right.,424
1477,"And you _were_ too hard on her, Rachel.”",424
1478,"Marilla could not help tacking on that last sentence, although she was again surprised at herself for doing it.",425
1479,Mrs. Rachel got up with an air of offended dignity.,425
1480,"“Well, I see that I’ll have to be very careful what I say after this, Marilla, since the fine feelings of orphans, brought from goodness knows where, have to be considered before anything else.",426
1481,"Oh, no, I’m not vexed--don’t worry yourself.",426
1482,I’m too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind.,426
1483,You’ll have your own troubles with that child.,426
1484,"But if you’ll take my advice--which I suppose you won’t do, although I’ve brought up ten children and buried two--you’ll do that ‘talking to’ you mention with a fair-sized birch switch.",426
1485,I should think _that_ would be the most effective language for that kind of a child.,426
1486,Her temper matches her hair I guess.,426
1487,"Well, good evening, Marilla.",426
1488,I hope you’ll come down to see me often as usual.,426
1489,"But you can’t expect me to visit here again in a hurry, if I’m liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion.",426
1490,It’s something new in _my_ experience.”,426
1491,Whereat Mrs. Rachel swept out and away--if a fat woman who always waddled _could_ be said to sweep away--and Marilla with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable.,427
1492,On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do.,428
1493,She felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted.,428
1494,"How unfortunate that Anne should have displayed such temper before Mrs. Rachel Lynde, of all people!",428
1495,Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in Anne’s disposition.,428
1496,And how was she to punish her?,428
1497,The amiable suggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs. Rachel’s own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not appeal to Marilla.,428
1498,She did not believe she could whip a child.,428
1499,"No, some other method of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper realization of the enormity of her offense.",428
1500,"Marilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.",429
1501,"“Anne,” she said not ungently.",430
1502,No answer.,431
1503,"“Anne,” with greater severity, “get off that bed this minute and listen to what I have to say to you.”",432
1504,"Anne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face swollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.",433
1505,“This is a nice way for you to behave.,434
1506,Anne!,434
1507,Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”,434
1508,"“She hadn’t any right to call me ugly and redheaded,” retorted Anne, evasive and defiant.",435
1509,"“You hadn’t any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her, Anne.",436
1510,I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you.,436
1511,"I wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have disgraced me.",436
1512,I’m sure I don’t know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely.,436
1513,You say it yourself often enough.”,436
1514,"“Oh, but there’s such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it,” wailed Anne.",437
1515,"“You may know a thing is so, but you can’t help hoping other people don’t quite think it is.",437
1516,"I suppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn’t help it.",437
1517,When she said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me.,437
1518,I _had_ to fly out at her.”,437
1519,"“Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say.",438
1520,"Mrs. Lynde will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she’ll tell it, too.",438
1521,"It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that, Anne.”",438
1522,"“Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly,” pleaded Anne tearfully.",439
1523,An old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla.,440
1524,"She had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, “What a pity she is such a dark, homely little thing.” Marilla was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.",440
1525,"“I don’t say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what she did to you, Anne,” she admitted in a softer tone.",441
1526,“Rachel is too outspoken.,441
1527,But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part.,441
1528,She was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her.,441
1529,You were rude and saucy and”--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--“you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you.”,441
1530,"“I can never do that,” said Anne determinedly and darkly.",442
1531,"“You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla.",442
1532,"You can shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain.",442
1533,But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me.”,442
1534,"“We’re not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,”  said Marilla drily, “especially as they’re rather scarce in Avonlea.",443
1535,But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you’ll stay here in your room until you can tell me you’re willing to do it.”,443
1536,"“I shall have to stay here forever then,” said Anne mournfully, “because I can’t tell Mrs. Lynde I’m sorry I said those things to her.",444
1537,How can I?,444
1538,I’m _not_ sorry.,444
1539,I’m sorry I’ve vexed you; but I’m _glad_ I told her just what I did.,444
1540,It was a great satisfaction.,444
1541,"I can’t say I’m sorry when I’m not, can I?",444
1542,I can’t even _imagine_ I’m sorry.”,444
1543,"“Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning,” said Marilla, rising to depart.",445
1544,“You’ll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind.,445
1545,"You said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but I must say it hasn’t seemed very much like it this evening.”",445
1546,"Leaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne’s stormy bosom, Marilla descended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul.",446
1547,"She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she recalled Mrs. Rachel’s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.",446
1548, CHAPTER X. Anne’s Apology,448
1549, MARILLA said nothing to Matthew about the affair that evening; but when Anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence from the breakfast table.,449
1550,"Marilla told Matthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of the enormity of Anne’s behavior.",449
1551,"“It’s a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she’s a meddlesome old gossip,” was Matthew’s consolatory rejoinder.",450
1552,"“Matthew Cuthbert, I’m astonished at you.",451
1553,"You know that Anne’s behavior was dreadful, and yet you take her part!",451
1554,I suppose you’ll be saying next thing that she oughtn’t to be punished at all!”,451
1555,"“Well now--no--not exactly,” said Matthew uneasily.",452
1556,“I reckon she ought to be punished a little.,452
1557,"But don’t be too hard on her, Marilla.",452
1558,Recollect she hasn’t ever had anyone to teach her right.,452
1559,"You’re--you’re going to give her something to eat, aren’t you?”",452
1560,“When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior?”  demanded Marilla indignantly.,453
1561,"“She’ll have her meals regular, and I’ll carry them up to her myself.",453
1562,"But she’ll stay up there until she’s willing to apologize to Mrs. Lynde, and that’s final, Matthew.”",453
1563,"Breakfast, dinner, and supper were very silent meals--for Anne still remained obdurate.",454
1564,After each meal Marilla carried a well-filled tray to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted.,454
1565,Matthew eyed its last descent with a troubled eye.,454
1566,Had Anne eaten anything at all?,454
1567,"When Marilla went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture, Matthew, who had been hanging about the barns and watching, slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs.",455
1568,As a general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to tea.,455
1569,"But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.",455
1570,He tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers and then open the door to peep in.,456
1571,Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden.,457
1572,"Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew’s heart smote him.",457
1573,He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.,457
1574,"“Anne,” he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, “how are you making it, Anne?”",458
1575,Anne smiled wanly.,459
1576,“Pretty well.,460
1577,"I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time.",460
1578,"Of course, it’s rather lonesome.",460
1579,"But then, I may as well get used to that.”",460
1580,"Anne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment before her.",461
1581,"Matthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely.",462
1582,"“Well now, Anne, don’t you think you’d better do it and have it over with?” he whispered.",462
1583,"“It’ll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla’s a dreadful determined woman--dreadful determined, Anne.",462
1584,"Do it right off, I say, and have it over.”",462
1585,“Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?”,463
1586,"“Yes--apologize--that’s the very word,” said Matthew eagerly.",464
1587,“Just smooth it over so to speak.,464
1588,That’s what I was trying to get at.”,464
1589,"“I suppose I could do it to oblige you,” said Anne thoughtfully.",465
1590,"“It would be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now.",465
1591,I wasn’t a bit sorry last night.,465
1592,"I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all night.",465
1593,I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious every time.,465
1594,But this morning it was over.,465
1595,"I wasn’t in a temper anymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too.",465
1596,I felt so ashamed of myself.,465
1597,But I just couldn’t think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so.,465
1598,It would be so humiliating.,465
1599,I made up my mind I’d stay shut up here forever rather than do that.,465
1600,But still--I’d do anything for you--if you really want me to--”,465
1601,"“Well now, of course I do.",466
1602,It’s terrible lonesome downstairs without you.,466
1603,Just go and smooth things over--that’s a good girl.”,466
1604,"“Very well,” said Anne resignedly.",467
1605,“I’ll tell Marilla as soon as she comes in I’ve repented.”,467
1606,"“That’s right--that’s right, Anne.",468
1607,But don’t tell Marilla I said anything about it.,468
1608,She might think I was putting my oar in and I promised not to do that.”,468
1609,"“Wild horses won’t drag the secret from me,” promised Anne solemnly.",469
1610,“How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?”,469
1611,"But Matthew was gone, scared at his own success.",470
1612,He fled hastily to the remotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what he had been up to.,470
1613,"Marilla herself, upon her return to the house, was agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling, “Marilla” over the banisters.",470
1614,"“Well?” she said, going into the hall.",471
1615,"“I’m sorry I lost my temper and said rude things, and I’m willing to go and tell Mrs. Lynde so.”",472
1616,“Very well.” Marilla’s crispness gave no sign of her relief.,473
1617,She had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if Anne did not give in.,473
1618,“I’ll take you down after milking.”,473
1619,"Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne walking down the lane, the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected.",474
1620,But halfway down Anne’s dejection vanished as if by enchantment.,474
1621,"She lifted her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her.",474
1622,Marilla beheld the change disapprovingly.,474
1623,This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her to take into the presence of the offended Mrs. Lynde.,474
1624,"“What are you thinking of, Anne?” she asked sharply.",475
1625,"“I’m imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde,” answered Anne dreamily.",476
1626,This was satisfactory--or should have been so.,477
1627,But Marilla could not rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was going askew.,477
1628,Anne had no business to look so rapt and radiant.,477
1629,"Rapt and radiant Anne continued until they were in the very presence of Mrs. Lynde, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window.",478
1630,Then the radiance vanished.,478
1631,Mournful penitence appeared on every feature.,478
1632,Before a word was spoken Anne suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished Mrs. Rachel and held out her hands beseechingly.,478
1633,"“Oh, Mrs. Lynde, I am so extremely sorry,” she said with a quiver in her voice.",479
1634,"“I could never express all my sorrow, no, not if I used up a whole dictionary.",479
1635,You must just imagine it.,479
1636,"I behaved terribly to you--and I’ve disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have let me stay at Green Gables although I’m not a boy.",479
1637,"I’m a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever.",479
1638,It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth.,479
1639,It _was_ the truth; every word you said was true.,479
1640,My hair is red and I’m freckled and skinny and ugly.,479
1641,"What I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn’t have said it.",479
1642,"Oh, Mrs. Lynde, please, please, forgive me.",479
1643,"If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a dreadful temper?",479
1644,"Oh, I am sure you wouldn’t.",479
1645,"Please say you forgive me, Mrs. Lynde.”",479
1646,"Anne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word of judgment.",480
1647,There was no mistaking her sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her voice.,481
1648,Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.,481
1649,But the former understood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying her valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her abasement.,481
1650,"Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla, had plumed herself?",481
1651,Anne had turned it into a species of positive pleasure.,481
1652,"Good Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see this.",482
1653,"She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.",482
1654,"“There, there, get up, child,” she said heartily.",483
1655,“Of course I forgive you.,483
1656,"I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway.",483
1657,But I’m such an outspoken person.,483
1658,"You just mustn’t mind me, that’s what.",483
1659,"It can’t be denied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school with her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn.",483
1660,"I wouldn’t be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.”",483
1661,"“Oh, Mrs. Lynde!” Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet.",484
1662,“You have given me a hope.,484
1663,I shall always feel that you are a benefactor.,484
1664,"Oh, I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when I grew up.",484
1665,"It would be so much easier to be good if one’s hair was a handsome auburn, don’t you think?",484
1666,And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and Marilla are talking?,484
1667,There is so much more scope for imagination out there.”,484
1668,"“Laws, yes, run along, child.",485
1669,And you can pick a bouquet of them white June lilies over in the corner if you like.”,485
1670,"As the door closed behind Anne, Mrs. Lynde got briskly up to light a lamp.",486
1671,“She’s a real odd little thing.,487
1672,"Take this chair, Marilla; it’s easier than the one you’ve got; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on.",487
1673,"Yes, she certainly is an odd child, but there is something kind of taking about her after all.",487
1674,"I don’t feel so surprised at you and Matthew keeping her as I did--nor so sorry for you, either.",487
1675,She may turn out all right.,487
1676,"Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little too--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she’ll likely get over that now that she’s come to live among civilized folks.",487
1677,"And then, her temper’s pretty quick, I guess; but there’s one comfort, a child that has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain’t never likely to be sly or deceitful.",487
1678,"Preserve me from a sly child, that’s what.",487
1679,"On the whole, Marilla, I kind of like her.”",487
1680,When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.,488
1681,"“I apologized pretty well, didn’t I?” she said proudly as they went down the lane.",489
1682,“I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly.”,489
1683,"“You did it thoroughly, all right enough,” was Marilla’s comment.",490
1684,Marilla was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection.,490
1685,"She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold Anne for apologizing so well; but then, that was ridiculous!",490
1686,She compromised with her conscience by saying severely:,490
1687,“I hope you won’t have occasion to make many more such apologies.,491
1688,"I hope you’ll try to control your temper now, Anne.”",491
1689,"“That wouldn’t be so hard if people wouldn’t twit me about my looks,”  said Anne with a sigh.",492
1690,“I don’t get cross about other things; but I’m _so_ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over.,492
1691,Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up?”,492
1692,"“You shouldn’t think so much about your looks, Anne.",493
1693,I’m afraid you are a very vain little girl.”,493
1694,“How can I be vain when I know I’m homely?” protested Anne.,494
1695,“I love pretty things; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that isn’t pretty.,494
1696,It makes me feel so sorrowful--just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing.,494
1697,I pity it because it isn’t beautiful.”,494
1698,"“Handsome is as handsome does,” quoted Marilla.",495
1699,"“I’ve had that said to me before, but I have my doubts about it,” remarked skeptical Anne, sniffing at her narcissi.",495
1700,"“Oh, aren’t these flowers sweet!",495
1701,It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me.,495
1702,I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now.,495
1703,"It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven, doesn’t it?",495
1704,Aren’t the stars bright tonight?,495
1705,"If you could live in a star, which one would you pick?",495
1706,I’d like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill.”,495
1707,"“Anne, do hold your tongue,” said Marilla, thoroughly worn out trying to follow the gyrations of Anne’s thoughts.",496
1708,Anne said no more until they turned into their own lane.,497
1709,"A little gypsy wind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns.",497
1710,Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables.,497
1711,Anne suddenly came close to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman’s hard palm.,497
1712,"“It’s lovely to be going home and know it’s home,” she said.",498
1713,"“I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before.",498
1714,No place ever seemed like home.,498
1715,"Oh, Marilla, I’m so happy.",498
1716,I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard.”,498
1717,"Something warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla’s heart at touch of that thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had missed, perhaps.",499
1718,Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her.,499
1719,She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral.,499
1720,"“If you’ll be a good girl you’ll always be happy, Anne.",500
1721,And you should never find it hard to say your prayers.”,500
1722,"“Saying one’s prayers isn’t exactly the same thing as praying,” said Anne meditatively.",501
1723,“But I’m going to imagine that I’m the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops.,501
1724,When I get tired of the trees I’ll imagine I’m gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I’ll fly over to Mrs. Lynde’s garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I’ll go with one great swoop over the clover field--and then I’ll blow over the Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.,501
1725,"Oh, there’s so much scope for imagination in a wind!",501
1726,"So I’ll not talk any more just now, Marilla.”",501
1727,"“Thanks be to goodness for that,” breathed Marilla in devout relief.",502
1728, CHAPTER XI.,504
1729,Anne’s Impressions of Sunday-school,504
1730," WELL, how do you like them?” said Marilla.",505
1731,"Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed.",506
1732,One was of snuffy colored gingham which Marilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store.,506
1733,"She had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts fulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt and tight as sleeves could be.",507
1734,"“I’ll imagine that I like them,” said Anne soberly.",508
1735,"“I don’t want you to imagine it,” said Marilla, offended.",509
1736,"“Oh, I can see you don’t like the dresses!",509
1737,What is the matter with them?,509
1738,Aren’t they neat and clean and new?”,509
1739,“Yes.”,510
1740,“Then why don’t you like them?”,511
1741,"“They’re--they’re not--pretty,” said Anne reluctantly.",512
1742,“Pretty!” Marilla sniffed.,513
1743,“I didn’t trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you.,513
1744,"I don’t believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I’ll tell you that right off.",513
1745,"Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable dresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they’re all you’ll get this summer.",513
1746,The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go.,513
1747,The sateen is for church and Sunday-school.,513
1748,I’ll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them.,513
1749,I should think you’d be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you’ve been wearing.”,513
1750,"“Oh, I _am_ grateful,” protested Anne.",514
1751,“But I’d be ever so much gratefuller if--if you’d made just one of them with puffed sleeves.,514
1752,Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now.,514
1753,"It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.”",514
1754,"“Well, you’ll have to do without your thrill.",515
1755,I hadn’t any material to waste on puffed sleeves.,515
1756,I think they are ridiculous-looking things anyhow.,515
1757,"I prefer the plain, sensible ones.”",515
1758,"“But I’d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself,” persisted Anne mournfully.",516
1759,“Trust you for that!,517
1760,"Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your closet, and then sit down and learn the Sunday-school lesson.",517
1761,"I got a quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you’ll go to Sunday-school tomorrow,” said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.",517
1762,Anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.,518
1763,"“I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,” she whispered disconsolately.",519
1764,"“I prayed for one, but I didn’t much expect it on that account.",519
1765,I didn’t suppose God would have time to bother about a little orphan girl’s dress.,519
1766,I knew I’d just have to depend on Marilla for it.,519
1767,"Well, fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves.”",519
1768,The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented Marilla from going to Sunday-school with Anne.,520
1769,"“You’ll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde, Anne,” she said.",521
1770,“She’ll see that you get into the right class.,521
1771,"Now, mind you behave yourself properly.",521
1772,Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to show you our pew.,521
1773,Here’s a cent for collection.,521
1774,Don’t stare at people and don’t fidget.,521
1775,I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home.”,521
1776,"Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure.",522
1777,"Her hat was a little, flat, glossy, new sailor, the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed Anne, who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers.",522
1778,"The latter, however, were supplied before Anne reached the main road, for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses, Anne promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them.",522
1779,"Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly.",522
1780,When she had reached Mrs. Lynde’s house she found that lady gone.,523
1781,"Nothing daunted, Anne proceeded onward to the church alone.",523
1782,"In the porch she found a crowd of little girls, all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks, and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst, with her extraordinary head adornment.",523
1783,Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about Anne.,523
1784,"Mrs. Lynde said she had an awful temper; Jerry Buote, the hired boy at Green Gables, said she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl.",523
1785,They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies.,523
1786,"Nobody made any friendly advances, then or later on when the opening exercises were over and Anne found herself in Miss Rogerson’s class.",523
1787,Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years.,524
1788,Her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she thought ought to answer the question.,524
1789,"She looked very often at Anne, and Anne, thanks to Marilla’s drilling, answered promptly; but it may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or answer.",524
1790,"She did not think she liked Miss Rogerson, and she felt very miserable; every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves.",525
1791,Anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.,525
1792,"“Well, how did you like Sunday-school?” Marilla wanted to know when Anne came home.",526
1793,"Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane, so Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.",526
1794,“I didn’t like it a bit.,527
1795,It was horrid.”,527
1796,“Anne Shirley!” said Marilla rebukingly.,528
1797,"Anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny’s leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.",529
1798,"“They might have been lonesome while I was away,” she explained.",530
1799,“And now about the Sunday-school.,530
1800,"I behaved well, just as you told me.",530
1801,"Mrs. Lynde was gone, but I went right on myself.",530
1802,"I went into the church, with a lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on.",530
1803,Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer.,530
1804,I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I hadn’t been sitting by that window.,530
1805,"But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things.”",530
1806,“You shouldn’t have done anything of the sort.,531
1807,You should have listened to Mr. Bell.”,531
1808,"“But he wasn’t talking to me,” protested Anne.",532
1809,"“He was talking to God and he didn’t seem to be very much interested in it, either.",532
1810,I think he thought God was too far off though.,532
1811,"There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, ‘way, ‘way down, deep into the water.",532
1812,"Oh, Marilla, it was like a beautiful dream!",532
1813,"It gave me a thrill and I just said, ‘Thank you for it, God,’ two or three times.”",532
1814,"“Not out loud, I hope,” said Marilla anxiously.",533
1815,"“Oh, no, just under my breath.",534
1816,"Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson’s class.",534
1817,There were nine other girls in it.,534
1818,They all had puffed sleeves.,534
1819,"I tried to imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn’t.",534
1820,Why couldn’t I?,534
1821,"It was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs.”",534
1822,“You shouldn’t have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday-school.,535
1823,You should have been attending to the lesson.,535
1824,I hope you knew it.”,535
1825,"“Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions.",536
1826,Miss Rogerson asked ever so many.,536
1827,I don’t think it was fair for her to do all the asking.,536
1828,"There were lots I wanted to ask her, but I didn’t like to because I didn’t think she was a kindred spirit.",536
1829,Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase.,536
1830,She asked me if I knew any.,536
1831,"I told her I didn’t, but I could recite, ‘The Dog at His Master’s Grave’ if she liked.",536
1832,That’s in the Third Royal Reader.,536
1833,"It isn’t a really truly religious piece of poetry, but it’s so sad and melancholy that it might as well be.",536
1834,She said it wouldn’t do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday.,536
1835,I read it over in church afterwards and it’s splendid.,536
1836,There are two lines in particular that just thrill me.,536
1837,   “‘Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell      In Midian’s evil day.’,537
1838,"“I don’t know what ‘squadrons’ means nor ‘Midian,’ either, but it sounds _so_ tragical.",538
1839,I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.,538
1840,I’ll practice it all the week.,538
1841,After Sunday-school I asked Miss Rogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.,538
1842,"I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third chapter, second and third verses.",538
1843,It was a very long text.,538
1844,"If I was a minister I’d pick the short, snappy ones.",538
1845,"The sermon was awfully long, too.",538
1846,I suppose the minister had to match it to the text.,538
1847,I didn’t think he was a bit interesting.,538
1848,The trouble with him seems to be that he hasn’t enough imagination.,538
1849,I didn’t listen to him very much.,538
1850,I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things.”,538
1851,"Marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things Anne had said, especially about the minister’s sermons and Mr. Bell’s prayers, were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years, but had never given expression to.",539
1852,"It almost seemed to her that those secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity.",539
1853, CHAPTER XII.,541
1854,A Solemn Vow and Promise,541
1855, IT was not until the next Friday that Marilla heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat.,542
1856,She came home from Mrs. Lynde’s and called Anne to account.,542
1857,"“Anne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups.",543
1858,What on earth put you up to such a caper?,543
1859,A pretty-looking object you must have been!”,543
1860,“Oh.,544
1861,"I know pink and yellow aren’t becoming to me,” began Anne.",544
1862,“Becoming fiddlesticks!,545
1863,"It was putting flowers on your hat at all, no matter what color they were, that was ridiculous.",545
1864,You are the most aggravating child!”,545
1865,"“I don’t see why it’s any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress,” protested Anne.",546
1866,“Lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses.,546
1867,What’s the difference?”,546
1868,Marilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the abstract.,547
1869,"“Don’t answer me back like that, Anne.",548
1870,It was very silly of you to do such a thing.,548
1871,Never let me catch you at such a trick again.,548
1872,Mrs. Rachel says she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all rigged out like that.,548
1873,She couldn’t get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late.,548
1874,She says people talked about it something dreadful.,548
1875,Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that.”,548
1876,"“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Anne, tears welling into her eyes.",549
1877,“I never thought you’d mind.,549
1878,The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I thought they’d look lovely on my hat.,549
1879,Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats.,549
1880,I’m afraid I’m going to be a dreadful trial to you.,549
1881,Maybe you’d better send me back to the asylum.,549
1882,"That would be terrible; I don’t think I could endure it; most likely I would go into consumption; I’m so thin as it is, you see.",549
1883,But that would be better than being a trial to you.”,549
1884,"“Nonsense,” said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child cry.",550
1885,"“I don’t want to send you back to the asylum, I’m sure.",550
1886,All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous.,550
1887,Don’t cry any more.,550
1888,I’ve got some news for you.,550
1889,Diana Barry came home this afternoon.,550
1890,"I’m going up to see if I can borrow a skirt pattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with Diana.”",550
1891,"Anne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on her cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor.",551
1892,"“Oh, Marilla, I’m frightened--now that it has come I’m actually frightened.",552
1893,What if she shouldn’t like me!,552
1894,It would be the most tragical disappointment of my life.”,552
1895,"“Now, don’t get into a fluster.",553
1896,And I do wish you wouldn’t use such long words.,553
1897,It sounds so funny in a little girl.,553
1898,I guess Diana ‘ll like you well enough.,553
1899,It’s her mother you’ve got to reckon with.,553
1900,If she doesn’t like you it won’t matter how much Diana does.,553
1901,If she has heard about your outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat I don’t know what she’ll think of you.,553
1902,"You must be polite and well behaved, and don’t make any of your startling speeches.",553
1903,"For pity’s sake, if the child isn’t actually trembling!”",553
1904,Anne _was_ trembling.,554
1905,Her face was pale and tense.,554
1906,"“Oh, Marilla, you’d be excited, too, if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother mightn’t like you,” she said as she hastened to get her hat.",555
1907,They went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up the firry hill grove.,556
1908,Mrs. Barry came to the kitchen door in answer to Marilla’s knock.,556
1909,"She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a very resolute mouth.",556
1910,She had the reputation of being very strict with her children.,556
1911,"“How do you do, Marilla?” she said cordially.",557
1912,“Come in.,557
1913,"And this is the little girl you have adopted, I suppose?”",557
1914,"“Yes, this is Anne Shirley,” said Marilla.",558
1915,"“Spelled with an E,” gasped Anne, who, tremulous and excited as she was, was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important point.",559
1916,"Mrs. Barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and said kindly:",560
1917,“How are you?”,561
1918,"“I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you ma’am,” said Anne gravely.",562
1919,"Then aside to Marilla in an audible whisper, “There wasn’t anything startling in that, was there, Marilla?”",562
1920,"Diana was sitting on the sofa, reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered.",563
1921,"She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother’s black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father.",563
1922,"“This is my little girl Diana,” said Mrs. Barry.",564
1923,"“Diana, you might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers.",564
1924,It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book.,564
1925,"She reads entirely too much--” this to Marilla as the little girls went out--“and I can’t prevent her, for her father aids and abets her.",564
1926,She’s always poring over a book.,564
1927,I’m glad she has the prospect of a playmate--perhaps it will take her more out-of-doors.”,564
1928,"Outside in the garden, which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through the dark old firs to the west of it, stood Anne and Diana, gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies.",565
1929,The Barry garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have delighted Anne’s heart at any time less fraught with destiny.,566
1930,"It was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished flowers that loved the shade.",566
1931,"Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old-fashioned flowers ran riot.",566
1932,"There were rosy bleeding-hearts and great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny, sweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted Bouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint; purple Adam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where sunshine lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering, purred and rustled.",566
1933,"“Oh, Diana,” said Anne at last, clasping her hands and speaking almost in a whisper, “oh, do you think you can like me a little--enough to be my bosom friend?”",567
1934,Diana laughed.,568
1935,Diana always laughed before she spoke.,568
1936,"“Why, I guess so,” she said frankly.",569
1937,“I’m awfully glad you’ve come to live at Green Gables.,569
1938,It will be jolly to have somebody to play with.,569
1939,"There isn’t any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I’ve no sisters big enough.”",569
1940,“Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?” demanded Anne eagerly.,570
1941,Diana looked shocked.,571
1942,"“Why it’s dreadfully wicked to swear,” she said rebukingly.",572
1943,"“Oh no, not my kind of swearing.",573
1944,"There are two kinds, you know.”",573
1945,"“I never heard of but one kind,” said Diana doubtfully.",574
1946,“There really is another.,575
1947,"Oh, it isn’t wicked at all.",575
1948,It just means vowing and promising solemnly.”,575
1949,"“Well, I don’t mind doing that,” agreed Diana, relieved.",576
1950,“How do you do it?”,576
1951,"“We must join hands--so,” said Anne gravely.",577
1952,“It ought to be over running water.,577
1953,We’ll just imagine this path is running water.,577
1954,I’ll repeat the oath first.,577
1955,"I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend, Diana Barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure.",577
1956,Now you say it and put my name in.”,577
1957,Diana repeated the “oath” with a laugh fore and aft.,578
1958,Then she said:,578
1959,"“You’re a queer girl, Anne.",579
1960,I heard before that you were queer.,579
1961,But I believe I’m going to like you real well.”,579
1962,When Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log bridge.,580
1963,The two little girls walked with their arms about each other.,580
1964,At the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together.,580
1965,"“Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?” asked Marilla as they went up through the garden of Green Gables.",581
1966,"“Oh yes,” sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on Marilla’s part.",582
1967,"“Oh Marilla, I’m the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment.",582
1968,I assure you I’ll say my prayers with a right good-will tonight.,582
1969,Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William Bell’s birch grove tomorrow.,582
1970,Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed?,582
1971,Diana’s birthday is in February and mine is in March.,582
1972,Don’t you think that is a very strange coincidence?,582
1973,Diana is going to lend me a book to read.,582
1974,She says it’s perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting.,582
1975,She’s going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow.,582
1976,Don’t you think Diana has got very soulful eyes?,582
1977,I wish I had soulful eyes.,582
1978,"Diana is going to teach me to sing a song called ‘Nelly in the Hazel Dell.’ She’s going to give me a picture to put up in my room; it’s a perfectly beautiful picture, she says--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress.",582
1979,A sewing-machine agent gave it to her.,582
1980,I wish I had something to give Diana.,582
1981,"I’m an inch taller than Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she’d like to be thin because it’s so much more graceful, but I’m afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings.",582
1982,We’re going to the shore some day to gather shells.,582
1983,We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the Dryad’s Bubble.,582
1984,Isn’t that a perfectly elegant name?,582
1985,I read a story once about a spring called that.,582
1986,"A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I think.”",582
1987,"“Well, all I hope is you won’t talk Diana to death,” said Marilla.",583
1988,"“But remember this in all your planning, Anne.",583
1989,You’re not going to play all the time nor most of it.,583
1990,You’ll have your work to do and it’ll have to be done first.”,583
1991,"Anne’s cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow.",584
1992,"He had just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a deprecatory look at Marilla.",584
1993,"“I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,” he said.",585
1994,"“Humph,” sniffed Marilla.",586
1995,“It’ll ruin her teeth and stomach.,586
1996,"There, there, child, don’t look so dismal.",586
1997,"You can eat those, since Matthew has gone and got them.",586
1998,He’d better have brought you peppermints.,586
1999,They’re wholesomer.,586
2000,Don’t sicken yourself eating all them at once now.”,586
2001,"“Oh, no, indeed, I won’t,” said Anne eagerly.",587
2002,"“I’ll just eat one tonight, Marilla.",587
2003,"And I can give Diana half of them, can’t I?",587
2004,The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her.,587
2005,It’s delightful to think I have something to give her.”,587
2006,"“I will say it for the child,” said Marilla when Anne had gone to her gable, “she isn’t stingy.",588
2007,"I’m glad, for of all faults I detest stinginess in a child.",588
2008,"Dear me, it’s only three weeks since she came, and it seems as if she’d been here always.",588
2009,I can’t imagine the place without her.,588
2010,"Now, don’t be looking I told-you-so, Matthew.",588
2011,"That’s bad enough in a woman, but it isn’t to be endured in a man.",588
2012,"I’m perfectly willing to own up that I’m glad I consented to keep the child and that I’m getting fond of her, but don’t you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.”",588
2013, CHAPTER XIII.,590
2014,The Delights of Anticipation,590
2015," IT’S time Anne was in to do her sewing,” said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat.",591
2016,"“She stayed playing with Diana more than half an hour more ‘n I gave her leave to; and now she’s perched out there on the woodpile talking to Matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work.",591
2017,And of course he’s listening to her like a perfect ninny.,591
2018,I never saw such an infatuated man.,591
2019,"The more she talks and the odder the things she says, the more he’s delighted evidently.",591
2020,"Anne Shirley, you come right in here this minute, do you hear me!”",591
2021,"A series of staccato taps on the west window brought Anne flying in from the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness.",592
2022,"“Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed breathlessly, “there’s going to be a Sunday-school picnic next week--in Mr. Harmon Andrews’s field, right near the lake of Shining Waters.",593
2023,And Mrs.,593
2024,"Superintendent Bell and Mrs. Rachel Lynde are going to make ice cream--think of it, Marilla--_ice cream!_ And, oh, Marilla, can I go to it?”",593
2025,"“Just look at the clock, if you please, Anne.",594
2026,What time did I tell you to come in?”,594
2027,"“Two o’clock--but isn’t it splendid about the picnic, Marilla?",595
2028,Please can I go?,595
2029,"Oh, I’ve never been to a picnic--I’ve dreamed of picnics, but I’ve never--”",595
2030,"“Yes, I told you to come at two o’clock.",596
2031,And it’s a quarter to three.,596
2032,"I’d like to know why you didn’t obey me, Anne.”",596
2033,"“Why, I meant to, Marilla, as much as could be.",597
2034,But you have no idea how fascinating Idlewild is.,597
2035,"And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew about the picnic.",597
2036,Matthew is such a sympathetic listener.,597
2037,Please can I go?”,597
2038,“You’ll have to learn to resist the fascination of Idle-whatever-you-call-it.,598
2039,When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later.,598
2040,"And you needn’t stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way, either.",598
2041,"As for the picnic, of course you can go.",598
2042,"You’re a Sunday-school scholar, and it’s not likely I’d refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going.”",598
2043,"“But--but,” faltered Anne, “Diana says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat.",599
2044,"I can’t cook, as you know, Marilla, and--and--I don’t mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much, but I’d feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket.",599
2045,It’s been preying on my mind ever since Diana told me.”,599
2046,"“Well, it needn’t prey any longer.",600
2047,I’ll bake you a basket.”,600
2048,"“Oh, you dear good Marilla.",601
2049,"Oh, you are so kind to me.",601
2050,"Oh, I’m so much obliged to you.”",601
2051,Getting through with her “ohs” Anne cast herself into Marilla’s arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek.,602
2052,It was the first time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched Marilla’s face.,602
2053,Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her.,602
2054,"She was secretly vastly pleased at Anne’s impulsive caress, which was probably the reason why she said brusquely:",602
2055,"“There, there, never mind your kissing nonsense.",603
2056,I’d sooner see you doing strictly as you’re told.,603
2057,"As for cooking, I mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days.",603
2058,"But you’re so featherbrained, Anne, I’ve been waiting to see if you’d sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin.",603
2059,You’ve got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation.,603
2060,"Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime.”",603
2061,"“I do _not_ like patchwork,” said Anne dolefully, hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh.",604
2062,“I think some kinds of sewing would be nice; but there’s no scope for imagination in patchwork.,604
2063,It’s just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere.,604
2064,But of course I’d rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other place with nothing to do but play.,604
2065,"I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when I’m playing with Diana, though.",604
2066,"Oh, we do have such elegant times, Marilla.",604
2067,"I have to furnish most of the imagination, but I’m well able to do that.",604
2068,Diana is simply perfect in every other way.,604
2069,You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry’s.,604
2070,"It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees--the most romantic spot, Marilla.",604
2071,Diana and I have our playhouse there.,604
2072,We call it Idlewild.,604
2073,Isn’t that a poetical name?,604
2074,I assure you it took me some time to think it out.,604
2075,I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it.,604
2076,"Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came like an inspiration.",604
2077,Diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it.,604
2078,We have got our house fixed up elegantly.,604
2079,"You must come and see it, Marilla--won’t you?",604
2080,"We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and boards from tree to tree for shelves.",604
2081,And we have all our dishes on them.,604
2082,"Of course, they’re all broken but it’s the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole.",604
2083,There’s a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful.,604
2084,"We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too.",604
2085,The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream.,604
2086,Diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house.,604
2087,It’s all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows that haven’t grown big yet--and Diana’s mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had.,604
2088,"But it’s nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass.",604
2089,Matthew is going to make us a table.,604
2090,"Oh, we have named that little round pool over in Mr. Barry’s field Willowmere.",604
2091,I got that name out of the book Diana lent me.,604
2092,"That was a thrilling book, Marilla.",604
2093,The heroine had five lovers.,604
2094,"I’d be satisfied with one, wouldn’t you?",604
2095,She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations.,604
2096,She could faint as easy as anything.,604
2097,"I’d love to be able to faint, wouldn’t you, Marilla?",604
2098,It’s so romantic.,604
2099,But I’m really very healthy for all I’m so thin.,604
2100,"I believe I’m getting fatter, though.",604
2101,Don’t you think I am?,604
2102,I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming.,604
2103,Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves.,604
2104,She is going to wear it to the picnic.,604
2105,"Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday.",604
2106,I don’t feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic.,604
2107,"I suppose I’d live through it, but I’m certain it would be a lifelong sorrow.",604
2108,It wouldn’t matter if I got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn’t make up for missing this one.,604
2109,"They’re going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters--and ice cream, as I told you.",604
2110,I have never tasted ice cream.,604
2111,"Diana tried to explain what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond imagination.”",604
2112,"“Anne, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock,” said Marilla.",605
2113,"“Now, just for curiosity’s sake, see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time.”",605
2114,Anne held her tongue as desired.,606
2115,But for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic.,606
2116,On Saturday it rained and she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over Wednesday that Marilla made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves.,606
2117,On Sunday Anne confided to Marilla on the way home from church that she grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic from the pulpit.,607
2118,"“Such a thrill as went up and down my back, Marilla!",608
2119,I don’t think I’d ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic.,608
2120,I couldn’t help fearing I’d only imagined it.,608
2121,But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it.”,608
2122,"“You set your heart too much on things, Anne,” said Marilla, with a sigh.",609
2123,“I’m afraid there’ll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life.”,609
2124,"“Oh, Marilla, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them,”  exclaimed Anne.",610
2125,“You mayn’t get the things themselves; but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them.,610
2126,"Mrs. Lynde says, ‘Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed.’ But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed.”",610
2127,Marilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual.,611
2128,Marilla always wore her amethyst brooch to church.,611
2129,She would have thought it rather sacrilegious to leave it off--as bad as forgetting her Bible or her collection dime.,611
2130,That amethyst brooch was Marilla’s most treasured possession.,611
2131,A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to Marilla.,611
2132,"It was an old-fashioned oval, containing a braid of her mother’s hair, surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts.",611
2133,"Marilla knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were; but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above her good brown satin dress, even although she could not see it.",611
2134,Anne had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch.,612
2135,"“Oh, Marilla, it’s a perfectly elegant brooch.",613
2136,I don’t know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on.,613
2137,"I couldn’t, I know.",613
2138,I think amethysts are just sweet.,613
2139,They are what I used to think diamonds were like.,613
2140,"Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like.",613
2141,I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones.,613
2142,When I saw a real diamond in a lady’s ring one day I was so disappointed I cried.,613
2143,"Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn’t my idea of a diamond.",613
2144,"Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, Marilla?",613
2145,Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets?”,613
2146, CHAPTER XIV.,615
2147,Anne’s Confession,615
2148, ON the Monday evening before the picnic Marilla came down from her room with a troubled face.,616
2149,"“Anne,” she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing, “Nelly of the Hazel Dell” with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana’s teaching, “did you see anything of my amethyst brooch?",617
2150,"I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can’t find it anywhere.”",617
2151,"“I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,” said Anne, a little slowly.",618
2152,"“I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion, so I went in to look at it.”",618
2153,“Did you touch it?” said Marilla sternly.,619
2154,"“Y-e-e-s,” admitted Anne, “I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look.”",620
2155,“You had no business to do anything of the sort.,621
2156,It’s very wrong in a little girl to meddle.,621
2157,You shouldn’t have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldn’t have touched a brooch that didn’t belong to you in the second.,621
2158,Where did you put it?”,621
2159,"“Oh, I put it back on the bureau.",622
2160,I hadn’t it on a minute.,622
2161,"Truly, I didn’t mean to meddle, Marilla.",622
2162,I didn’t think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I’ll never do it again.,622
2163,That’s one good thing about me.,622
2164,I never do the same naughty thing twice.”,622
2165,"“You didn’t put it back,” said Marilla.",623
2166,“That brooch isn’t anywhere on the bureau.,623
2167,"You’ve taken it out or something, Anne.”",623
2168,"“I did put it back,” said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought.",624
2169,“I don’t just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray.,624
2170,But I’m perfectly certain I put it back.”,624
2171,"“I’ll go and have another look,” said Marilla, determining to be just.",625
2172,“If you put that brooch back it’s there still.,625
2173,"If it isn’t I’ll know you didn’t, that’s all!”",625
2174,"Marilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be.",626
2175,It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.,626
2176,"“Anne, the brooch is gone.",627
2177,By your own admission you were the last person to handle it.,627
2178,"Now, what have you done with it?",627
2179,Tell me the truth at once.,627
2180,Did you take it out and lose it?”,627
2181,"“No, I didn’t,” said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla’s angry gaze squarely.",628
2182,"“I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I’m not very certain what a block is.",628
2183,"So there, Marilla.”",628
2184,"Anne’s “so there” was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but Marilla took it as a display of defiance.",629
2185,"“I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,” she said sharply.",630
2186,“I know you are.,630
2187,"There now, don’t say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth.",630
2188,Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess.”,630
2189,“Will I take the peas with me?” said Anne meekly.,631
2190,"“No, I’ll finish shelling them myself.",632
2191,Do as I bid you.”,632
2192,When Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind.,633
2193,She was worried about her valuable brooch.,633
2194,What if Anne had lost it?,633
2195,"And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see she must have!",633
2196,"With such an innocent face, too!",633
2197,"“I don’t know what I wouldn’t sooner have had happen,” thought Marilla, as she nervously shelled the peas.",634
2198,"“Of course, I don’t suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that.",634
2199,She’s just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers.,634
2200,"She must have taken it, that’s clear, for there hasn’t been a soul in that room since she was in it, by her own story, until I went up tonight.",634
2201,"And the brooch is gone, there’s nothing surer.",634
2202,I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she’ll be punished.,634
2203,It’s a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods.,634
2204,It’s a far worse thing than her fit of temper.,634
2205,It’s a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can’t trust.,634
2206,Slyness and untruthfulness--that’s what she has displayed.,634
2207,I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch.,634
2208,If she’d only have told the truth about it I wouldn’t mind so much.”,634
2209,"Marilla went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch, without finding it.",635
2210,A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result.,635
2211,Anne persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but Marilla was only the more firmly convinced that she did.,635
2212,She told Matthew the story the next morning.,636
2213,Matthew was confounded and puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Anne but he had to admit that circumstances were against her.,636
2214,“You’re sure it hasn’t fell down behind the bureau?” was the only suggestion he could offer.,637
2215,“I’ve moved the bureau and I’ve taken out the drawers and I’ve looked in every crack and cranny” was Marilla’s positive answer.,638
2216,“The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it.,638
2217,"That’s the plain, ugly truth, Matthew Cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face.”",638
2218,"“Well now, what are you going to do about it?” Matthew asked forlornly, feeling secretly thankful that Marilla and not he had to deal with the situation.",639
2219,He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.,639
2220,"“She’ll stay in her room until she confesses,” said Marilla grimly, remembering the success of this method in the former case.",640
2221,“Then we’ll see.,640
2222,"Perhaps we’ll be able to find the brooch if she’ll only tell where she took it; but in any case she’ll have to be severely punished, Matthew.”",640
2223,"“Well now, you’ll have to punish her,” said Matthew, reaching for his hat.",641
2224,"“I’ve nothing to do with it, remember.",641
2225,You warned me off yourself.”,641
2226,Marilla felt deserted by everyone.,642
2227,She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde for advice.,642
2228,She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still.,642
2229,Anne steadfastly refused to confess.,642
2230,She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch.,642
2231,The child had evidently been crying and Marilla felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed.,642
2232,"By night she was, as she expressed it, “beat out.”",642
2233,"“You’ll stay in this room until you confess, Anne.",643
2234,"You can make up your mind to that,” she said firmly.",643
2235,"“But the picnic is tomorrow, Marilla,” cried Anne.",644
2236,"“You won’t keep me from going to that, will you?",644
2237,"You’ll just let me out for the afternoon, won’t you?",644
2238,Then I’ll stay here as long as you like _afterwards_ cheerfully.,644
2239,But I _must_ go to the picnic.”,644
2240,"“You’ll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you’ve confessed, Anne.”",645
2241,"“Oh, Marilla,” gasped Anne.",646
2242,But Marilla had gone out and shut the door.,647
2243,Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic.,648
2244,"Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction.",648
2245,The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for Anne’s usual morning greeting from the east gable.,648
2246,But Anne was not at her window.,648
2247,"When Marilla took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.",648
2248,"“Marilla, I’m ready to confess.”",649
2249,“Ah!” Marilla laid down her tray.,650
2250,Once again her method had succeeded; but her success was very bitter to her.,650
2251,"“Let me hear what you have to say then, Anne.”",650
2252,"“I took the amethyst brooch,” said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she had learned.",651
2253,“I took it just as you said.,651
2254,I didn’t mean to take it when I went in.,651
2255,"But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation.",651
2256,I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald.,651
2257,It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on.,651
2258,Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts?,651
2259,So I took the brooch.,651
2260,I thought I could put it back before you came home.,651
2261,I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time.,651
2262,When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it.,651
2263,"Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight!",651
2264,"And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it just slipped through my fingers--so--and went down--down--down, all purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters.",651
2265,"And that’s the best I can do at confessing, Marilla.”",651
2266,Marilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again.,652
2267,This child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance.,652
2268,"“Anne, this is terrible,” she said, trying to speak calmly.",653
2269,“You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of.”,653
2270,"“Yes, I suppose I am,” agreed Anne tranquilly.",654
2271,“And I know I’ll have to be punished.,654
2272,"It’ll be your duty to punish me, Marilla.",654
2273,Won’t you please get it over right off because I’d like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind.”,654
2274,"“Picnic, indeed!",655
2275,"You’ll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley.",655
2276,That shall be your punishment.,655
2277,And it isn’t half severe enough either for what you’ve done!”,655
2278,“Not go to the picnic!” Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla’s hand.,656
2279,“But you _promised_ me I might!,656
2280,"Oh, Marilla, I must go to the picnic.",656
2281,That was why I confessed.,656
2282,Punish me any way you like but that.,656
2283,"Oh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic.",656
2284,Think of the ice cream!,656
2285,For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again.”,656
2286,Marilla disengaged Anne’s clinging hands stonily.,657
2287,"“You needn’t plead, Anne.",658
2288,You are not going to the picnic and that’s final.,658
2289,"No, not a word.”",658
2290,Anne realized that Marilla was not to be moved.,659
2291,"She clasped her hands together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair.",659
2292,"“For the land’s sake!” gasped Marilla, hastening from the room.",660
2293,“I believe the child is crazy.,660
2294,No child in her senses would behave as she does.,660
2295,If she isn’t she’s utterly bad.,660
2296,"Oh dear, I’m afraid Rachel was right from the first.",660
2297,But I’ve put my hand to the plow and I won’t look back.”,660
2298,That was a dismal morning.,661
2299,Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do.,661
2300,Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did.,661
2301,Then she went out and raked the yard.,661
2302,When dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne.,662
2303,"A tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.",662
2304,"“Come down to your dinner, Anne.”",663
2305,"“I don’t want any dinner, Marilla,” said Anne, sobbingly.",664
2306,“I couldn’t eat anything.,664
2307,My heart is broken.,664
2308,"You’ll feel remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you.",664
2309,Remember when the time comes that I forgive you.,664
2310,"But please don’t ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens.",664
2311,Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction.”,664
2312,"Exasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.",665
2313,"“Well now, she shouldn’t have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories about it,” he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling, “but she’s such a little thing--such an interesting little thing.",666
2314,Don’t you think it’s pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she’s so set on it?”,666
2315,"“Matthew Cuthbert, I’m amazed at you.",667
2316,I think I’ve let her off entirely too easy.,667
2317,And she doesn’t appear to realize how wicked she’s been at all--that’s what worries me most.,667
2318,If she’d really felt sorry it wouldn’t be so bad.,667
2319,"And you don’t seem to realize it, neither; you’re making excuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that.”",667
2320,"“Well now, she’s such a little thing,” feebly reiterated Matthew.",668
2321,"“And there should be allowances made, Marilla.",668
2322,You know she’s never had any bringing up.”,668
2323,"“Well, she’s having it now” retorted Marilla.",669
2324,The retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him.,670
2325,That dinner was a very dismal meal.,670
2326,"The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote, the hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult.",670
2327,When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed Marilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies’ Aid.,671
2328,She would go and mend it.,672
2329,The shawl was in a box in her trunk.,672
2330,"As Marilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl--something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light.",672
2331,Marilla snatched at it with a gasp.,672
2332,"It was the amethyst brooch, hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch!",672
2333,"“Dear life and heart,” said Marilla blankly, “what does this mean?",673
2334,Here’s my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of Barry’s pond.,673
2335,Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it?,673
2336,I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched.,673
2337,I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute.,673
2338,I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow.,673
2339,Well!”,673
2340,"Marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand.",674
2341,Anne had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.,674
2342,"“Anne Shirley,” said Marilla solemnly, “I’ve just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl.",675
2343,Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant.”,675
2344,"“Why, you said you’d keep me here until I confessed,” returned Anne wearily, “and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic.",676
2345,I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could.,676
2346,And I said it over and over so that I wouldn’t forget it.,676
2347,"But you wouldn’t let me go to the picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted.”",676
2348,Marilla had to laugh in spite of herself.,677
2349,But her conscience pricked her.,677
2350,"“Anne, you do beat all!",678
2351,But I was wrong--I see that now.,678
2352,I shouldn’t have doubted your word when I’d never known you to tell a story.,678
2353,"Of course, it wasn’t right for you to confess to a thing you hadn’t done--it was very wrong to do so.",678
2354,But I drove you to it.,678
2355,"So if you’ll forgive me, Anne, I’ll forgive you and we’ll start square again.",678
2356,And now get yourself ready for the picnic.”,678
2357,Anne flew up like a rocket.,679
2358,"“Oh, Marilla, isn’t it too late?”",680
2359,"“No, it’s only two o’clock.",681
2360,They won’t be more than well gathered yet and it’ll be an hour before they have tea.,681
2361,Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham.,681
2362,I’ll fill a basket for you.,681
2363,There’s plenty of stuff baked in the house.,681
2364,And I’ll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.”,681
2365,"“Oh, Marilla,” exclaimed Anne, flying to the wash-stand.",682
2366,“Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I’d never been born and now I wouldn’t change places with an angel!”,682
2367,"That night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Anne returned to Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.",683
2368,"“Oh, Marilla, I’ve had a perfectly scrumptious time.",684
2369,Scrumptious is a new word I learned today.,684
2370,I heard Mary Alice Bell use it.,684
2371,Isn’t it very expressive?,684
2372,Everything was lovely.,684
2373,We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters--six of us at a time.,684
2374,And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard.,684
2375,She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews hadn’t caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she’d fallen in and prob’ly been drowned.,684
2376,I wish it had been me.,684
2377,It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned.,684
2378,It would be such a thrilling tale to tell.,684
2379,And we had the ice cream.,684
2380,Words fail me to describe that ice cream.,684
2381,"Marilla, I assure you it was sublime.”",684
2382,That evening Marilla told the whole story to Matthew over her stocking basket.,685
2383,"“I’m willing to own up that I made a mistake,” she concluded candidly, “but I’ve learned a lesson.",686
2384,"I have to laugh when I think of Anne’s ‘confession,’ although I suppose I shouldn’t for it really was a falsehood.",686
2385,"But it doesn’t seem as bad as the other would have been, somehow, and anyhow I’m responsible for it.",686
2386,That child is hard to understand in some respects.,686
2387,But I believe she’ll turn out all right yet.,686
2388,"And there’s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that she’s in.”",686
2389, CHAPTER XV.,688
2390,A Tempest in the School Teapot,688
2391," WHAT a splendid day!” said Anne, drawing a long breath.",689
2392,“Isn’t it good just to be alive on a day like this?,689
2393,I pity the people who aren’t born yet for missing it.,689
2394,"They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this one.",689
2395,"And it’s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn’t it?”",689
2396,"“It’s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot,” said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.",690
2397,"The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one’s best chum would have forever and ever branded as “awful mean” the girl who did it.",691
2398,"And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got enough to tantalize you.",691
2399,The way Anne and Diana went to school _was_ a pretty one.,692
2400,Anne thought those walks to and from school with Diana couldn’t be improved upon even by imagination.,692
2401,"Going around by the main road would have been so unromantic; but to go by Lover’s Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and the Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.",692
2402,Lover’s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm.,693
2403,It was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter.,693
2404,Anne had named it Lover’s Lane before she had been a month at Green Gables.,693
2405,"“Not that lovers ever really walk there,” she explained to Marilla, “but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there’s a Lover’s Lane in it.",694
2406,"So we want to have one, too.",694
2407,"And it’s a very pretty name, don’t you think?",694
2408,So romantic!,694
2409,"We can’t imagine the lovers into it, you know.",694
2410,I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.”,694
2411,"Anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover’s Lane as far as the brook.",695
2412,"Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples--“maples are such sociable trees,” said Anne; “they’re always rustling and whispering to you”--until they came to a rustic bridge.",695
2413,Then they left the lane and walked through Mr. Barry’s back field and past Willowmere.,695
2414,Beyond Willowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell’s big woods.,695
2415,"“Of course there are no violets there now,”  Anne told Marilla, “but Diana says there are millions of them in spring.",695
2416,"Oh, Marilla, can’t you just imagine you see them?",695
2417,It actually takes away my breath.,695
2418,I named it Violet Vale.,695
2419,Diana says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places.,695
2420,"It’s nice to be clever at something, isn’t it?",695
2421,But Diana named the Birch Path.,695
2422,"She wanted to, so I let her; but I’m sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path.",695
2423,Anybody can think of a name like that.,695
2424,"But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla.”",695
2425,It was.,696
2426,Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it.,696
2427,"It was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight through Mr. Bell’s woods, where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond.",696
2428,"It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead.",696
2429,"Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in a blue moon.",696
2430,Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.,696
2431,"The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children.",697
2432,The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.,697
2433,Marilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September with many secret misgivings.,698
2434,Anne was such an odd girl.,698
2435,How would she get on with the other children?,698
2436,And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?,698
2437,"Things went better than Marilla feared, however.",699
2438,Anne came home that evening in high spirits.,699
2439,"“I think I’m going to like school here,” she announced.",700
2440,"“I don’t think much of the master, though.",700
2441,He’s all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews.,700
2442,"Prissy is grown up, you know.",700
2443,She’s sixteen and she’s studying for the entrance examination into Queen’s Academy at Charlottetown next year.,700
2444,Tillie Boulter says the master is _dead gone_ on her.,700
2445,She’s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly.,700
2446,"She sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he says.",700
2447,But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and Ruby Gillis says she doesn’t believe it had anything to do with the lesson.”,700
2448,"“Anne Shirley, don’t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again,” said Marilla sharply.",701
2449,“You don’t go to school to criticize the master.,701
2450,"I guess he can teach _you_ something, and it’s your business to learn.",701
2451,And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him.,701
2452,That is something I won’t encourage.,701
2453,I hope you were a good girl.”,701
2454,"“Indeed I was,” said Anne comfortably.",702
2455,"“It wasn’t so hard as you might imagine, either.",702
2456,I sit with Diana.,702
2457,Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters.,702
2458,There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime.,702
2459,It’s so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with.,702
2460,But of course I like Diana best and always will.,702
2461,I _adore_ Diana.,702
2462,I’m dreadfully far behind the others.,702
2463,They’re all in the fifth book and I’m only in the fourth.,702
2464,I feel that it’s kind of a disgrace.,702
2465,But there’s not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out.,702
2466,We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today.,702
2467,"Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over.",702
2468,"I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think.",702
2469,Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ‘May I see you home?’ on it.,702
2470,I’m to give it back to her tomorrow.,702
2471,And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon.,702
2472,Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring?,702
2473,"And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose.",702
2474,"Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can’t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me.",702
2475,"Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?",702
2476,I know you’ll tell me the truth.”,702
2477,"“Your nose is well enough,” said Marilla shortly.",703
2478,Secretly she thought Anne’s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of telling her so.,703
2479,That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far.,704
2480,"And now, this crisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the Birch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.",704
2481,"“I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,” said Diana.",705
2482,“He’s been visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came home Saturday night.,705
2483,"He’s _aw’fly_ handsome, Anne.",705
2484,And he teases the girls something terrible.,705
2485,He just torments our lives out.”,705
2486,Diana’s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented out than not.,706
2487,“Gilbert Blythe?” said Anne.,707
2488,“Isn’t his name that’s written up on the porch wall with Julia Bell’s and a big ‘Take Notice’ over them?”,707
2489,"“Yes,” said Diana, tossing her head, “but I’m sure he doesn’t like Julia Bell so very much.",708
2490,I’ve heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles.”,708
2491,"“Oh, don’t speak about freckles to me,” implored Anne.",709
2492,“It isn’t delicate when I’ve got so many.,709
2493,But I do think that writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever.,709
2494,I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy’s.,709
2495,"Not, of course,” she hastened to add, “that anybody would.”",709
2496,Anne sighed.,710
2497,She didn’t want her name written up.,710
2498,But it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.,710
2499,"“Nonsense,” said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices.",711
2500,“It’s only meant as a joke.,711
2501,And don’t you be too sure your name won’t ever be written up.,711
2502,Charlie Sloane is _dead gone_ on you.,711
2503,"He told his mother--his _mother_, mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school.",711
2504,That’s better than being good-looking.”,711
2505,"“No, it isn’t,” said Anne, feminine to the core.",712
2506,“I’d rather be pretty than clever.,712
2507,"And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can’t bear a boy with goggle eyes.",712
2508,"If anyone wrote my name up with his I’d _never_ get over it, Diana Barry.",712
2509,But it _is_ nice to keep head of your class.”,712
2510,"“You’ll have Gilbert in your class after this,” said Diana, “and he’s used to being head of his class, I can tell you.",713
2511,He’s only in the fourth book although he’s nearly fourteen.,713
2512,Four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him.,713
2513,They were there three years and Gil didn’t go to school hardly any until they came back.,713
2514,"You won’t find it so easy to keep head after this, Anne.”",713
2515,"“I’m glad,” said Anne quickly.",714
2516,“I couldn’t really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten.,714
2517,"I got up yesterday spelling ‘ebullition.’ Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped in her book.",714
2518,Mr. Phillips didn’t see her--he was looking at Prissy Andrews--but I did.,714
2519,I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.”,714
2520,"“Those Pye girls are cheats all round,” said Diana indignantly, as they climbed the fence of the main road.",715
2521,“Gertie Pye actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday.,715
2522,Did you ever?,715
2523,I don’t speak to her now.”,715
2524,"When Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews’s Latin, Diana whispered to Anne, “That’s Gilbert Blythe sitting right across the aisle from you, Anne.",716
2525,Just look at him and see if you don’t think he’s handsome.”,716
2526,Anne looked accordingly.,717
2527,"She had a good chance to do so, for the said Gilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat.",717
2528,"He was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile.",717
2529,"Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek, believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots.",717
2530,Everybody looked at her and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry.,717
2531,Gilbert had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at Anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.,717
2532,"“I think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome,” confided Anne to Diana, “but I think he’s very bold.",718
2533,It isn’t good manners to wink at a strange girl.”,718
2534,But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.,719
2535,"Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to Prissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.",720
2536,"Gilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing utterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in Avonlea school itself.",720
2537,"With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.",720
2538,Gilbert Blythe wasn’t used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him and meeting with failure.,721
2539,"She _should_ look at him, that red-haired Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren’t like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.",721
2540,"Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne’s long red braid, held it out at arm’s length and said in a piercing whisper:",722
2541,“Carrots!,723
2542,Carrots!”,723
2543,Then Anne looked at him with a vengeance!,724
2544,She did more than look.,725
2545,"She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin.",725
2546,She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears.,725
2547,"“You mean, hateful boy!” she exclaimed passionately.",726
2548,“How dare you!”,726
2549,And then--thwack!,727
2550,Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert’s head and cracked it--slate not head--clear across.,727
2551,Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene.,728
2552,This was an especially enjoyable one.,728
2553,Everybody said “Oh” in horrified delight.,728
2554,Diana gasped.,728
2555,"Ruby Gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry.",728
2556,Tommy Sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open-mouthed at the tableau.,728
2557,Mr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne’s shoulder.,729
2558,"“Anne Shirley, what does this mean?” he said angrily.",730
2559,Anne returned no answer.,730
2560,It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell before the whole school that she had been called “carrots.” Gilbert it was who spoke up stoutly.,730
2561,“It was my fault Mr. Phillips.,731
2562,I teased her.”,731
2563,Mr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.,732
2564,"“I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit,” he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of small imperfect mortals.",733
2565,"“Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.”",733
2566,Anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash.,734
2567,"With a white, set face she obeyed.",734
2568,Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head.,734
2569,“Ann Shirley has a very bad temper.,735
2570,"Ann Shirley must learn to control her temper,” and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who couldn’t read writing, should understand it.",735
2571,Anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.,736
2572,She did not cry or hang her head.,736
2573,Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation.,736
2574,With resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana’s sympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane’s indignant nods and Josie Pye’s malicious smiles.,736
2575,"As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.",736
2576,She would _never_ look at him again!,736
2577,She would never speak to him!,736
2578,!,736
2579,When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high.,737
2580,Gilbert Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.,737
2581,"“I’m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,” he whispered contritely.",738
2582,“Honest I am.,738
2583,"Don’t be mad for keeps, now.”",738
2584,"Anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing.",739
2585,"“Oh how could you, Anne?” breathed Diana as they went down the road half reproachfully, half admiringly.",739
2586,Diana felt that _she_ could never have resisted Gilbert’s plea.,739
2587,"“I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,” said Anne firmly.",740
2588,"“And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an e, too.",740
2589,"The iron has entered into my soul, Diana.”",740
2590,Diana hadn’t the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was something terrible.,741
2591,"“You mustn’t mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,” she said soothingly.",742
2592,"“Why, he makes fun of all the girls.",742
2593,He laughs at mine because it’s so black.,742
2594,"He’s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him apologize for anything before, either.”",742
2595,"“There’s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots,” said Anne with dignity.",743
2596,"“Gilbert Blythe has hurt my feelings _excruciatingly_, Diana.”",743
2597,It is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened.,744
2598,But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on.,744
2599,Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell’s spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field.,745
2600,"From there they could keep an eye on Eben Wright’s house, where the master boarded.",745
2601,"When they saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright’s lane they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes too late.",745
2602,"On the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned.",746
2603,Anyone who came in late would be punished.,746
2604,"All the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell’s spruce grove as usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to “pick a chew.” But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce “Master’s coming.”",747
2605,"The girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare.",748
2606,"The boys, who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of all.",748
2607,"Anne could run like a deer, however; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr. Phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.",748
2608,"Mr. Phillips’s brief reforming energy was over; he didn’t want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.",749
2609,"“Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys’ company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,” he said sarcastically.",750
2610,“Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.”,750
2611,The other boys snickered.,751
2612,"Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the wreath from Anne’s hair and squeezed her hand.",751
2613,Anne stared at the master as if turned to stone.,751
2614,"“Did you hear what I said, Anne?” queried Mr. Phillips sternly.",752
2615,"“Yes, sir,” said Anne slowly “but I didn’t suppose you really meant it.”",753
2616,"“I assure you I did”--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children, and Anne especially, hated.",754
2617,It flicked on the raw.,754
2618,“Obey me at once.”,754
2619,For a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey.,755
2620,"Then, realizing that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms on the desk.",755
2621,"Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home from school that she’d “acksually never seen anything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.”",755
2622,"To Anne, this was as the end of all things.",756
2623,"It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable.",756
2624,Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try.,756
2625,Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation.,756
2626,At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.,757
2627,"But as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to their own tasks and Anne was forgotten.",757
2628,"When Mr. Phillips called the history class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and Mr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses “To Priscilla” before he called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her.",757
2629,"Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, “You are sweet,” and slipped it under the curve of Anne’s arm.",757
2630,"Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.",757
2631,"When school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.",758
2632,"“What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?” Diana wanted to know, as soon as they were out on the road.",759
2633,She had not dared to ask the question before.,759
2634,"“I am not coming back to school any more,” said Anne.",760
2635,Diana gasped and stared at Anne to see if she meant it.,760
2636,“Will Marilla let you stay home?” she asked.,761
2637,"“She’ll have to,” said Anne.",762
2638,“I’ll _never_ go to school to that man again.”,762
2639,"“Oh, Anne!” Diana looked as if she were ready to cry.",763
2640,“I do think you’re mean.,763
2641,What shall I do?,763
2642,Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid Gertie Pye--I know he will because she is sitting alone.,763
2643,"Do come back, Anne.”",763
2644,"“I’d do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,” said Anne sadly.",764
2645,“I’d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good.,764
2646,"But I can’t do this, so please don’t ask it.",764
2647,You harrow up my very soul.”,764
2648,"“Just think of all the fun you will miss,” mourned Diana.",765
2649,"“We are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we’ll be playing ball next week and you’ve never played ball, Anne.",765
2650,It’s tremendously exciting.,765
2651,"And we’re going to learn a new song--Jane Andrews is practicing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and we’re all going to read it out loud, chapter about, down by the brook.",765
2652,"And you know you are so fond of reading out loud, Anne.”",765
2653,Nothing moved Anne in the least.,766
2654,Her mind was made up.,766
2655,She would not go to school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.,766
2656,"“Nonsense,” said Marilla.",767
2657,"“It isn’t nonsense at all,” said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn, reproachful eyes.",768
2658,"“Don’t you understand, Marilla?",768
2659,I’ve been insulted.”,768
2660,“Insulted fiddlesticks!,769
2661,You’ll go to school tomorrow as usual.”,769
2662,"“Oh, no.” Anne shook her head gently.",770
2663,"“I’m not going back, Marilla.",770
2664,I’ll learn my lessons at home and I’ll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it’s possible at all.,770
2665,"But I will not go back to school, I assure you.”",770
2666,Marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of Anne’s small face.,771
2667,She understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it; but she resolved wisely to say nothing more just then.,771
2668,"“I’ll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,” she thought.",772
2669,“There’s no use reasoning with Anne now.,772
2670,She’s too worked up and I’ve an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion.,772
2671,"Far as I can make out from her story, Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand.",772
2672,But it would never do to say so to her.,772
2673,I’ll just talk it over with Rachel.,772
2674,She’s sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it.,772
2675,"She’ll have heard the whole story, too, by this time.”",772
2676,Marilla found Mrs. Lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual.,773
2677,"“I suppose you know what I’ve come about,” she said, a little shamefacedly.",774
2678,Mrs. Rachel nodded.,775
2679,"“About Anne’s fuss in school, I reckon,” she said.",776
2680,“Tillie Boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it.”,776
2681,"“I don’t know what to do with her,” said Marilla.",777
2682,“She declares she won’t go back to school.,777
2683,I never saw a child so worked up.,777
2684,I’ve been expecting trouble ever since she started to school.,777
2685,I knew things were going too smooth to last.,777
2686,She’s so high strung.,777
2687,"What would you advise, Rachel?”",777
2688,"“Well, since you’ve asked my advice, Marilla,” said Mrs. Lynde amiably--Mrs. Lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--“I’d just humor her a little at first, that’s what I’d do.",778
2689,It’s my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong.,778
2690,"Of course, it doesn’t do to say so to the children, you know.",778
2691,And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper.,778
2692,But today it was different.,778
2693,"The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne, that’s what.",778
2694,And I don’t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment.,778
2695,It isn’t modest.,778
2696,Tillie Boulter was real indignant.,778
2697,She took Anne’s part right through and said all the scholars did too.,778
2698,"Anne seems real popular among them, somehow.",778
2699,I never thought she’d take with them so well.”,778
2700,"“Then you really think I’d better let her stay home,” said Marilla in amazement.",779
2701,“Yes.,780
2702,That is I wouldn’t say school to her again until she said it herself.,780
2703,"Depend upon it, Marilla, she’ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that’s what, while, if you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she’d take next and make more trouble than ever.",780
2704,"The less fuss made the better, in my opinion.",780
2705,"She won’t miss much by not going to school, as far as _that_ goes.",780
2706,Mr. Phillips isn’t any good at all as a teacher.,780
2707,"The order he keeps is scandalous, that’s what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he’s getting ready for Queen’s.",780
2708,"He’d never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadn’t been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two around by the nose, that’s what.",780
2709,"I declare, I don’t know what education in this Island is coming to.”",780
2710,"Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed.",781
2711,Marilla took Mrs. Rachel’s advice and not another word was said to Anne about going back to school.,782
2712,"She learned her lessons at home, did her chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday-school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her.",782
2713,Even Diana’s efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail.,782
2714,Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life.,782
2715,"As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes.",783
2716,"One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.",783
2717,"“Whatever’s the matter now, Anne?” she asked.",784
2718,"“It’s about Diana,” sobbed Anne luxuriously.",785
2719,"“I love Diana so, Marilla.",785
2720,I cannot ever live without her.,785
2721,But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me.,785
2722,"And oh, what shall I do?",785
2723,I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously.,785
2724,"I’ve been imagining it all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face.",785
2725,And then bidding Diana goodbye-e-e--” Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness.,785
2726,"Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement.",786
2727,When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?,786
2728,"“Well, Anne Shirley,” said Marilla as soon as she could speak, “if you must borrow trouble, for pity’s sake borrow it handier home.",787
2729,"I should think you had an imagination, sure enough.”",787
2730, CHAPTER XVI.,789
2731,Diana Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results,789
2732," OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry-trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths.",790
2733,Anne reveled in the world of color about her.,791
2734,"“Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.",792
2735,"It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it?",792
2736,Look at these maple branches.,792
2737,Don’t they give you a thrill--several thrills?,792
2738,I’m going to decorate my room with them.”,792
2739,"“Messy things,” said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed.",793
2740,"“You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne.",793
2741,Bedrooms were made to sleep in.”,793
2742,"“Oh, and dream in too, Marilla.",794
2743,And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things.,794
2744,I’m going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.”,794
2745,“Mind you don’t drop leaves all over the stairs then.,795
2746,"I’m going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won’t likely be home before dark.",795
2747,"You’ll have to get Matthew and Jerry their supper, so mind you don’t forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time.”",795
2748,"“It was dreadful of me to forget,” said Anne apologetically, “but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it crowded other things out.",796
2749,Matthew was so good.,796
2750,He never scolded a bit.,796
2751,He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not.,796
2752,"And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn’t find the time long at all.",796
2753,"It was a beautiful fairy story, Marilla.",796
2754,"I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he couldn’t tell where the join came in.”",796
2755,"“Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night.",797
2756,But you keep your wits about you this time.,797
2757,And--I don’t really know if I’m doing right--it may make you more addlepated than ever--but you can ask Diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.”,797
2758,"“Oh, Marilla!” Anne clasped her hands.",798
2759,“How perfectly lovely!,798
2760,You _are_ able to imagine things after all or else you’d never have understood how I’ve longed for that very thing.,798
2761,It will seem so nice and grown-uppish.,798
2762,No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company.,798
2763,"Oh, Marilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?”",798
2764,"“No, indeed!",799
2765,The rosebud tea set!,799
2766,"Well, what next?",799
2767,You know I never use that except for the minister or the Aids.,799
2768,You’ll put down the old brown tea set.,799
2769,But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.,799
2770,It’s time it was being used anyhow--I believe it’s beginning to work.,799
2771,And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.”,799
2772,"“I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea,” said Anne, shutting her eyes ecstatically.",800
2773,“And asking Diana if she takes sugar!,800
2774,I know she doesn’t but of course I’ll ask her just as if I didn’t know.,800
2775,And then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves.,800
2776,"Oh, Marilla, it’s a wonderful sensation just to think of it.",800
2777,Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes?,800
2778,And then into the parlor to sit?”,800
2779,“No.,801
2780,The sitting room will do for you and your company.,801
2781,But there’s a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night.,801
2782,"It’s on the second shelf of the sitting-room closet and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew ‘ll be late coming in to tea since he’s hauling potatoes to the vessel.”",801
2783,"Anne flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad’s Bubble and up the spruce path to Orchard Slope, to ask Diana to tea.",802
2784,"As a result just after Marilla had driven off to Carmody, Diana came over, dressed in _her_ second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea.",802
2785,At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door.,802
2786,"And when Anne, dressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before.",802
2787,"This unnatural solemnity lasted until after Diana had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room, toes in position.",802
2788,"“How is your mother?” inquired Anne politely, just as if she had not seen Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits.",803
2789,"“She is very well, thank you.",804
2790,"I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the _lily sands_ this afternoon, is he?” said Diana, who had ridden down to Mr. Harmon Andrews’s that morning in Matthew’s cart.",804
2791,“Yes.,805
2792,Our potato crop is very good this year.,805
2793,I hope your father’s crop is good too.”,805
2794,"“It is fairly good, thank you.",806
2795,Have you picked many of your apples yet?”,806
2796,"“Oh, ever so many,” said Anne forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly.",807
2797,"“Let’s go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings, Diana.",807
2798,Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree.,807
2799,Marilla is a very generous woman.,807
2800,She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea.,807
2801,"But it isn’t good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won’t tell you what she said we could have to drink.",807
2802,Only it begins with an R and a C and it’s bright red color.,807
2803,"I love bright red drinks, don’t you?",807
2804,They taste twice as good as any other color.”,807
2805,"The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they could.",808
2806,Diana had much to tell Anne of what went on in school.,808
2807,"She had to sit with Gertie Pye and she hated it; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her--Diana’s--blood run cold; Ruby Gillis had charmed all her warts away, true’s you live, with a magic pebble that old Mary Joe from the Creek gave her.",808
2808,You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go.,808
2809,Charlie Sloane’s name was written up with Em White’s on the porch wall and Em White was _awful mad_ about it; Sam Boulter had “sassed” Mr. Phillips in class and Mr. Phillips whipped him and Sam’s father came down to the school and dared Mr. Phillips to lay a hand on one of his children again; and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening; and Lizzie Wright didn’t speak to Mamie Wilson because Mamie Wilson’s grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright’s grown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed Anne so and wished she’s come to school again; and Gilbert Blythe--,808
2810,But Anne didn’t want to hear about Gilbert Blythe.,809
2811,She jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.,809
2812,Anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there.,810
2813,Search revealed it away back on the top shelf.,810
2814,Anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.,810
2815,"“Now, please help yourself, Diana,” she said politely.",811
2816,“I don’t believe I’ll have any just now.,811
2817,I don’t feel as if I wanted any after all those apples.”,811
2818,"Diana poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue admiringly, and then sipped it daintily.",812
2819,"“That’s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Anne,” she said.",813
2820,“I didn’t know raspberry cordial was so nice.”,813
2821,“I’m real glad you like it.,814
2822,Take as much as you want.,814
2823,I’m going to run out and stir the fire up.,814
2824,"There are so many responsibilities on a person’s mind when they’re keeping house, isn’t there?”",814
2825,"When Anne came back from the kitchen Diana was drinking her second glassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Anne, she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third.",815
2826,The tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.,815
2827,"“The nicest I ever drank,” said Diana.",816
2828,"“It’s ever so much nicer than Mrs. Lynde’s, although she brags of hers so much.",816
2829,It doesn’t taste a bit like hers.”,816
2830,"“I should think Marilla’s raspberry cordial would prob’ly be much nicer than Mrs. Lynde’s,” said Anne loyally.",817
2831,“Marilla is a famous cook.,817
2832,"She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work.",817
2833,There’s so little scope for imagination in cookery.,817
2834,You just have to go by rules.,817
2835,The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in.,817
2836,"I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana.",817
2837,"I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you.",817
2838,"Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana.",817
2839,The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake.,817
2840,But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure.,817
2841,"Flour is so essential to cakes, you know.",817
2842,Marilla was very cross and I don’t wonder.,817
2843,I’m a great trial to her.,817
2844,She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week.,817
2845,We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over.,817
2846,Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it.,817
2847,"I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun--of course I’m a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce.",817
2848,I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry.,817
2849,"Diana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce!",817
2850,I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters.,817
2851,"Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I’d give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples.",817
2852,"Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning.",817
2853,"You know they are very stylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross.",817
2854,When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table.,817
2855,"I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn’t pretty.",817
2856,"Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other.",817
2857,"Diana, that was a terrible moment.",817
2858,"I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ‘Marilla, you mustn’t use that pudding sauce.",817
2859,There was a mouse drowned in it.,817
2860,"I forgot to tell you before.’ Oh, Diana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred.",817
2861,Mrs. Chester Ross just _looked_ at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification.,817
2862,She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us.,817
2863,Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word--then.,817
2864,She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves.,817
2865,"She even offered me some, but I couldn’t swallow a mouthful.",817
2866,It was like heaping coals of fire on my head.,817
2867,"After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding.",817
2868,"Why, Diana, what is the matter?”",817
2869,"Diana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her hands to her head.",818
2870,"“I’m--I’m awful sick,” she said, a little thickly.",819
2871,“I--I--must go right home.”,819
2872,"“Oh, you mustn’t dream of going home without your tea,” cried Anne in distress.",820
2873,“I’ll get it right off--I’ll go and put the tea down this very minute.”,820
2874,"“I must go home,” repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.",821
2875,"“Let me get you a lunch anyhow,” implored Anne.",822
2876,“Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves.,822
2877,Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you’ll be better.,822
2878,Where do you feel bad?”,822
2879,"“I must go home,” said Diana, and that was all she would say.",823
2880,In vain Anne pleaded.,823
2881,"“I never heard of company going home without tea,” she mourned.",824
2882,"“Oh, Diana, do you suppose that it’s possible you’re really taking the smallpox?",824
2883,"If you are I’ll go and nurse you, you can depend on that.",824
2884,I’ll never forsake you.,824
2885,But I do wish you’d stay till after tea.,824
2886,Where do you feel bad?”,824
2887,"“I’m awful dizzy,” said Diana.",825
2888,"And indeed, she walked very dizzily.",826
2889,"Anne, with tears of disappointment in her eyes, got Diana’s hat and went with her as far as the Barry yard fence.",826
2890,"Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone out of the performance.",826
2891,The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk Anne did not stir abroad from Green Gables.,827
2892,Monday afternoon Marilla sent her down to Mrs. Lynde’s on an errand.,827
2893,In a very short space of time Anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks.,827
2894,Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony.,827
2895,"“Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?” queried Marilla in doubt and dismay.",828
2896,“I do hope you haven’t gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.”,828
2897,No answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!,829
2898,"“Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered.",830
2899,Sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.”,830
2900,"Anne sat up, tragedy personified.",831
2901,“Mrs.,832
2902,"Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an awful state,” she wailed.",832
2903,“She says that I set Diana _drunk_ Saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition.,832
2904,"And she says I must be a thoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she’s never, never going to let Diana play with me again.",832
2905,"Oh, Marilla, I’m just overcome with woe.”",832
2906,Marilla stared in blank amazement.,833
2907,“Set Diana drunk!” she said when she found her voice.,834
2908,“Anne are you or Mrs. Barry crazy?,834
2909,What on earth did you give her?”,834
2910,"“Not a thing but raspberry cordial,” sobbed Anne.",835
2911,"“I never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla--not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did.",835
2912,"Oh, it sounds so--so--like Mrs. Thomas’s husband!",835
2913,But I didn’t mean to set her drunk.”,835
2914,"“Drunk fiddlesticks!” said Marilla, marching to the sitting-room pantry.",836
2915,"There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort, Mrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it.",836
2916,And at the same time Marilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.,836
2917,She went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand.,837
2918,Her face was twitching in spite of herself.,837
2919,"“Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble.",838
2920,You went and gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial.,838
2921,Didn’t you know the difference yourself?”,838
2922,"“I never tasted it,” said Anne.",839
2923,“I thought it was the cordial.,839
2924,I meant to be so--so--hospitable.,839
2925,Diana got awfully sick and had to go home.,839
2926,Mrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk.,839
2927,She just laughed silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours.,839
2928,Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk.,839
2929,She had a fearful headache all day yesterday.,839
2930,Mrs. Barry is so indignant.,839
2931,She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.”,839
2932,"“I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything,” said Marilla shortly.",840
2933,"“Why, three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial.",840
2934,"Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine, although I haven’t made any for three years ever since I found out that the minister didn’t approve.",840
2935,I just kept that bottle for sickness.,840
2936,"There, there, child, don’t cry.",840
2937,I can’t see as you were to blame although I’m sorry it happened so.”,840
2938,"“I must cry,” said Anne.",841
2939,“My heart is broken.,841
2940,"The stars in their courses fight against me, Marilla.",841
2941,Diana and I are parted forever.,841
2942,"Oh, Marilla, I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.”",841
2943,"“Don’t be foolish, Anne.",842
2944,Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she finds you’re not to blame.,842
2945,I suppose she thinks you’ve done it for a silly joke or something of that sort.,842
2946,You’d best go up this evening and tell her how it was.”,842
2947,"“My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana’s injured mother,”  sighed Anne.",843
2948,"“I wish you’d go, Marilla.",843
2949,You’re so much more dignified than I am.,843
2950,Likely she’d listen to you quicker than to me.”,843
2951,"“Well, I will,” said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course.",844
2952,"“Don’t cry any more, Anne.",844
2953,It will be all right.”,844
2954,Marilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from Orchard Slope.,845
2955,Anne was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her.,845
2956,"“Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it’s been no use,” she said sorrowfully.",846
2957,“Mrs.,846
2958,Barry won’t forgive me?”,846
2959,“Mrs.,847
2960,Barry indeed!” snapped Marilla.,847
2961,“Of all the unreasonable women I ever saw she’s the worst.,847
2962,"I told her it was all a mistake and you weren’t to blame, but she just simply didn’t believe me.",847
2963,And she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I’d always said it couldn’t have the least effect on anybody.,847
2964,I just told her plainly that currant wine wasn’t meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I’d sober her up with a right good spanking.”,847
2965,"Marilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her.",848
2966,"Presently Anne stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods.",848
2967,"Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep.",848
2968,Her face hardened.,849
2969,"Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome.",849
2970,"To do her justice, she really believed Anne had made Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child.",849
2971,“What do you want?” she said stiffly.,850
2972,Anne clasped her hands.,851
2973,"“Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me.",852
2974,I did not mean to--to--intoxicate Diana.,852
2975,How could I?,852
2976,Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world.,852
2977,Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose?,852
2978,I thought it was only raspberry cordial.,852
2979,I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial.,852
2980,"Oh, please don’t say that you won’t let Diana play with me any more.",852
2981,If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.”,852
2982,"This speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde’s heart in a twinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still more.",853
2983,She was suspicious of Anne’s big words and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her.,853
2984,"So she said, coldly and cruelly:",853
2985,“I don’t think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.,854
2986,You’d better go home and behave yourself.”,854
2987,Anne’s lips quivered.,855
2988,“Won’t you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?” she implored.,856
2989,"“Diana has gone over to Carmody with her father,” said Mrs. Barry, going in and shutting the door.",857
2990,Anne went back to Green Gables calm with despair.,858
2991,"“My last hope is gone,” she told Marilla.",859
2992,“I went up and saw Mrs. Barry myself and she treated me very insultingly.,859
2993,"Marilla, I do _not_ think she is a well-bred woman.",859
2994,"There is nothing more to do except to pray and I haven’t much hope that that’ll do much good because, Marilla, I do not believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as Mrs. Barry.”",859
2995,"“Anne, you shouldn’t say such things” rebuked Marilla, striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her.",860
2996,"And indeed, when she told the whole story to Matthew that night, she did laugh heartily over Anne’s tribulations.",860
2997,But when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that Anne had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face.,861
2998,"“Poor little soul,” she murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from the child’s tear-stained face.",862
2999,Then she bent down and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow.,862
3000, CHAPTER XVII.,864
3001,A New Interest in Life,864
3002," THE next afternoon Anne, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window, happened to glance out and beheld Diana down by the Dryad’s Bubble beckoning mysteriously.",865
3003,"In a trice Anne was out of the house and flying down to the hollow, astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eyes.",865
3004,But the hope faded when she saw Diana’s dejected countenance.,865
3005,“Your mother hasn’t relented?” she gasped.,866
3006,Diana shook her head mournfully.,867
3007,"“No; and oh, Anne, she says I’m never to play with you again.",868
3008,"I’ve cried and cried and I told her it wasn’t your fault, but it wasn’t any use.",868
3009,I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to you.,868
3010,She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she’s timing me by the clock.”,868
3011,"“Ten minutes isn’t very long to say an eternal farewell in,” said Anne tearfully.",869
3012,"“Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget me, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress thee?”",869
3013,"“Indeed I will,” sobbed Diana, “and I’ll never have another bosom friend--I don’t want to have.",870
3014,I couldn’t love anybody as I love you.”,870
3015,"“Oh, Diana,” cried Anne, clasping her hands, “do you _love_ me?”",871
3016,"“Why, of course I do.",872
3017,Didn’t you know that?”,872
3018,“No.” Anne drew a long breath.,873
3019,“I thought you _liked_ me of course but I never hoped you _loved_ me.,873
3020,"Why, Diana, I didn’t think anybody could love me.",873
3021,Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember.,873
3022,"Oh, this is wonderful!",873
3023,"It’s a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee, Diana.",873
3024,"Oh, just say it once again.”",873
3025,"“I love you devotedly, Anne,” said Diana stanchly, “and I always will, you may be sure of that.”",874
3026,"“And I will always love thee, Diana,” said Anne, solemnly extending her hand.",875
3027,"“In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life, as that last story we read together says.",875
3028,"Diana, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore?”",875
3029,"“Have you got anything to cut it with?” queried Diana, wiping away the tears which Anne’s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh, and returning to practicalities.",876
3030,“Yes.,877
3031,"I’ve got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,”  said Anne.",877
3032,She solemnly clipped one of Diana’s curls.,877
3033,"“Fare thee well, my beloved friend.",877
3034,Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side.,877
3035,But my heart will ever be faithful to thee.”,877
3036,"Anne stood and watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving her hand to the latter whenever she turned to look back.",878
3037,"Then she returned to the house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting.",878
3038,"“It is all over,” she informed Marilla.",879
3039,“I shall never have another friend.,879
3040,"I’m really worse off than ever before, for I haven’t Katie Maurice and Violetta now.",879
3041,And even if I had it wouldn’t be the same.,879
3042,"Somehow, little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend.",879
3043,Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring.,879
3044,It will be sacred in my memory forever.,879
3045,I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said ‘thou’ and ‘thee.’ ‘Thou’ and ‘thee’ seem so much more romantic than ‘you.’ Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I’m going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life.,879
3046,"Please see that it is buried with me, for I don’t believe I’ll live very long.",879
3047,Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her Mrs. Barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let Diana come to my funeral.”,879
3048,"“I don’t think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk, Anne,” said Marilla unsympathetically.",880
3049,The following Monday Anne surprised Marilla by coming down from her room with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a line of determination.,881
3050,"“I’m going back to school,” she announced.",882
3051,"“That is all there is left in life for me, now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me.",882
3052,In school I can look at her and muse over days departed.”,882
3053,"“You’d better muse over your lessons and sums,” said Marilla, concealing her delight at this development of the situation.",883
3054,“If you’re going back to school I hope we’ll hear no more of breaking slates over people’s heads and such carryings on.,883
3055,Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you.”,883
3056,"“I’ll try to be a model pupil,” agreed Anne dolefully.",884
3057,"“There won’t be much fun in it, I expect.",884
3058,Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model pupil and there isn’t a spark of imagination or life in her.,884
3059,She is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time.,884
3060,But I feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now.,884
3061,I’m going round by the road.,884
3062,I couldn’t bear to go by the Birch Path all alone.,884
3063,I should weep bitter tears if I did.”,884
3064,Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms.,885
3065,"Her imagination had been sorely missed in games, her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour.",885
3066,Ruby Gillis smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading; Ella May MacPherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school.,885
3067,"Sophia Sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons.",885
3068,"Katie Boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and Julia Bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion:",885
3069,                “TO ANNE,886
3070,  “When twilight drops her curtain down   And pins it with a star   Remember that you have a friend   Though she may wander far.”,887
3071," “It’s so nice to be appreciated,” sighed Anne rapturously to Marilla that night.",888
3072,The girls were not the only scholars who “appreciated” her.,889
3073,When Anne went to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by Mr. Phillips to sit with the model Minnie Andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious “strawberry apple.” Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew was in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters.,889
3074,Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief.,889
3075,"The apple lay untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy Andrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one of his perquisites.",889
3076,"Charlie Sloane’s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met with a more favorable reception.",889
3077,Anne was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in after school to rewrite it.,889
3078,"But as,",890
3079,"  The Cæsar’s pageant shorn of Brutus’ bust   Did but of Rome’s best son remind her more,",891
3080,so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who was sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne’s little triumph.,892
3081,"“Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,” she mourned to Marilla that night.",893
3082,"But the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to Anne.",893
3083,"   “Dear Anne, ran the former, “Mother says I’m not to play with you or    talk to you even in school.",894
3084,"It isn’t my fault and don’t be cross at    me, because I love you as much as ever.",894
3085,I miss you awfully to tell    all my secrets to and I don’t like Gertie Pye one bit.,894
3086,I made you    one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper.,894
3087,They are awfully    fashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make    them.,894
3088,When you look at it remember,894
3089,"                                                      Your true friend,                                                            Diana Barry.",895
3090,"Anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school.",896
3091,  My own darling Diana:--,897
3092,  Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your   mother.,898
3093,Our spirits can commune.,898
3094,I shall keep your lovely present   forever.,898
3095,Minnie Andrews is a very nice little girl--although she   has no imagination--but after having been Diana’s busum friend I   cannot be Minnie’s.,898
3096,"Please excuse mistakes because my spelling   isn’t very good yet, although much improoved.",898
3097,                                           Yours until death us do part                                               Anne or Cordelia Shirley.,899
3098,   P.S.,900
3099,I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight.,900
3100,                                                           A.,901
3101,_or_ C.S.,901
3102,Marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun to go to school.,902
3103,But none developed.,902
3104,Perhaps Anne caught something of the “model” spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well with Mr. Phillips thenceforth.,902
3105,"She flung herself into her studies heart and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.",902
3106,"The rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured on Gilbert’s side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges.",902
3107,She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves.,902
3108,"She would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne persistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them.",902
3109,"Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with a toss of her long red braids, spelled him down.",902
3110,"One morning Gilbert had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before, would be first.",902
3111,One awful day they were ties and their names were written up together.,902
3112,It was almost as bad as a take-notice and Anne’s mortification was as evident as Gilbert’s satisfaction.,902
3113,When the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible.,902
3114,The first month Gilbert came out three marks ahead.,902
3115,The second Anne beat him by five.,902
3116,But her triumph was marred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the whole school.,902
3117,It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.,902
3118,Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher.,903
3119,"By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of “the branches”--by which Latin, geometry, French, and algebra were meant.",903
3120,In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.,903
3121,"“It’s perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,” she groaned.",904
3122,“I’m sure I’ll never be able to make head or tail of it.,904
3123,There is no scope for imagination in it at all.,904
3124,Mr. Phillips says I’m the worst dunce he ever saw at it.,904
3125,And Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it.,904
3126,"It is extremely mortifying, Marilla.",904
3127,“Even Diana gets along better than I do.,905
3128,But I don’t mind being beaten by Diana.,905
3129,Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an _inextinguishable_ love.,905
3130,It makes me very sad at times to think about her.,905
3131,"But really, Marilla, one can’t stay sad very long in such an interesting world, can one?”",905
3132, CHAPTER XVIII.,907
3133,Anne to the Rescue,907
3134, ALL things great are wound up with all things little.,908
3135,At first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables.,908
3136,But it had.,908
3137,"It was a January the Premier came, to address his loyal supporters and such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in Charlottetown.",909
3138,Most of the Avonlea people were on Premier’s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away.,909
3139,Mrs. Rachel Lynde had gone too.,909
3140,"Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot politician and couldn’t have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her, although she was on the opposite side of politics.",909
3141,So she went to town and took her husband--Thomas would be useful in looking after the horse--and Marilla Cuthbert with her.,909
3142,"Marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live Premier, she promptly took it, leaving Anne and Matthew to keep house until her return the following day.",909
3143,"Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to themselves.",910
3144,A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes.,910
3145,"Matthew nodded over a _Farmers’ Advocate_ on the sofa and Anne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that Jane Andrews had lent her that day.",910
3146,"Jane had assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and Anne’s fingers tingled to reach out for it.",910
3147,But that would mean Gilbert Blythe’s triumph on the morrow.,910
3148,Anne turned her back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it wasn’t there.,910
3149,"“Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?”",911
3150,"“Well now, no, I didn’t,” said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a start.",912
3151,"“I wish you had,” sighed Anne, “because then you’d be able to sympathize with me.",913
3152,You can’t sympathize properly if you’ve never studied it.,913
3153,It is casting a cloud over my whole life.,913
3154,"I’m such a dunce at it, Matthew.”",913
3155,"“Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew soothingly.",914
3156,“I guess you’re all right at anything.,914
3157,Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair’s store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress.,914
3158,‘Rapid progress’ was his very words.,914
3159,"There’s them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he ain’t much of a teacher, but I guess he’s all right.”",914
3160,Matthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was “all right.”,915
3161,"“I’m sure I’d get on better with geometry if only he wouldn’t change the letters,” complained Anne.",916
3162,“I learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up.,916
3163,"I don’t think a teacher should take such a mean advantage, do you?",916
3164,We’re studying agriculture now and I’ve found out at last what makes the roads red.,916
3165,It’s a great comfort.,916
3166,I wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves.,916
3167,Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that it’s an awful warning to the electors.,916
3168,She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change.,916
3169,"What way do you vote, Matthew?”",916
3170,"“Conservative,” said Matthew promptly.",917
3171,To vote Conservative was part of Matthew’s religion.,917
3172,"“Then I’m Conservative too,” said Anne decidedly.",918
3173,“I’m glad because Gil--because some of the boys in school are Grits.,918
3174,"I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too because Prissy Andrews’s father is one, and Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl’s mother in religion and her father in politics.",918
3175,"Is that true, Matthew?”",918
3176,"“Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew.",919
3177,"“Did you ever go courting, Matthew?”",920
3178,"“Well now, no, I dunno’s I ever did,” said Matthew, who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence.",921
3179,Anne reflected with her chin in her hands.,922
3180,"“It must be rather interesting, don’t you think, Matthew?",923
3181,Ruby Gillis says when she grows up she’s going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too exciting.,923
3182,I’d rather have just one in his right mind.,923
3183,"But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes.",923
3184,Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.,923
3185,"He says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen’s too, and I should think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because she’s ever so much stupider, but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all.",923
3186,"There are a great many things in this world that I can’t understand very well, Matthew.”",923
3187,"“Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,” acknowledged Matthew.",924
3188,"“Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons.",925
3189,I won’t allow myself to open that new book Jane lent me until I’m through.,925
3190,"But it’s a terrible temptation, Matthew.",925
3191,Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain.,925
3192,Jane said she cried herself sick over it.,925
3193,I love a book that makes me cry.,925
3194,But I think I’ll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key.,925
3195,"And you must _not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if I implore you on my bended knees.",925
3196,"It’s all very well to say resist temptation, but it’s ever so much easier to resist it if you can’t get the key.",925
3197,"And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets, Matthew?",925
3198,Wouldn’t you like some russets?”,925
3199,"“Well now, I dunno but what I would,” said Matthew, who never ate russets but knew Anne’s weakness for them.",926
3200,"Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head.",927
3201,"Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise, and plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day, by Marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn’t been set on fire.",927
3202,"“Whatever is the matter, Diana?” cried Anne.",928
3203,“Has your mother relented at last?”,928
3204,"“Oh, Anne, do come quick,” implored Diana nervously.",929
3205,“Minnie May is awful sick--she’s got croup.,929
3206,Young Mary Joe says--and Father and Mother are away to town and there’s nobody to go for the doctor.,929
3207,"Minnie May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe doesn’t know what to do--and oh, Anne, I’m so scared!”",929
3208,"Matthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past Diana and away into the darkness of the yard.",930
3209,"“He’s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor,”  said Anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket.",931
3210,“I know it as well as if he’d said so.,931
3211,Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his thoughts without words at all.”,931
3212,"“I don’t believe he’ll find the doctor at Carmody,” sobbed Diana.",932
3213,“I know that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer would go too.,932
3214,Young Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away.,932
3215,"Oh, Anne!”",932
3216,"“Don’t cry, Di,” said Anne cheerily.",933
3217,“I know exactly what to do for croup.,933
3218,You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times.,933
3219,When you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience.,933
3220,They all had croup regularly.,933
3221,Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle--you mayn’t have any at your house.,933
3222,Come on now.”,933
3223,"The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through Lover’s Lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way.",934
3224,"Anne, although sincerely sorry for Minnie May, was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit.",934
3225,"The night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them.",935
3226,Anne thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged.,935
3227,"Minnie May, aged three, was really very sick.",936
3228,"She lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house.",936
3229,"Young Mary Joe, a buxom, broad-faced French girl from the creek, whom Mrs. Barry had engaged to stay with the children during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.",936
3230,Anne went to work with skill and promptness.,937
3231,"“Minnie May has croup all right; she’s pretty bad, but I’ve seen them worse.",938
3232,First we must have lots of hot water.,938
3233,"I declare, Diana, there isn’t more than a cupful in the kettle!",938
3234,"There, I’ve filled it up, and, Mary Joe, you may put some wood in the stove.",938
3235,I don’t want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you’d any imagination.,938
3236,"Now, I’ll undress Minnie May and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths, Diana.",938
3237,I’m going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all.”,938
3238,Minnie May did not take kindly to the ipecac but Anne had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing.,939
3239,"Down that ipecac went, not only once, but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently over the suffering Minnie May, and Young Mary Joe, honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.",939
3240,"It was three o’clock when Matthew came with a doctor, for he had been obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one.",940
3241,But the pressing need for assistance was past.,940
3242,Minnie May was much better and was sleeping soundly.,940
3243,"“I was awfully near giving up in despair,” explained Anne.",941
3244,"“She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were, even the last pair.",941
3245,I actually thought she was going to choke to death.,941
3246,"I gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself--not to Diana or Young Mary Joe, because I didn’t want to worry them any more than they were worried, but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--‘This is the last lingering hope and I fear, tis a vain one.’ But in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away.",941
3247,"You must just imagine my relief, doctor, because I can’t express it in words.",941
3248,You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words.”,941
3249,"“Yes, I know,” nodded the doctor.",942
3250,He looked at Anne as if he were thinking some things about her that couldn’t be expressed in words.,942
3251,"Later on, however, he expressed them to Mr. and Mrs. Barry.",942
3252,“That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert’s is as smart as they make ‘em.,943
3253,"I tell you she saved that baby’s life, for it would have been too late by the time I got there.",943
3254,She seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age.,943
3255,I never saw anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me.”,943
3256,"Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the Lover’s Lane maples.",944
3257,"“Oh, Matthew, isn’t it a wonderful morning?",945
3258,"The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure, doesn’t it?",945
3259,Those trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath--pouf!,945
3260,"I’m so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you?",945
3261,And I’m so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all.,945
3262,If she hadn’t I mightn’t have known what to do for Minnie May.,945
3263,I’m real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins.,945
3264,"But, oh, Matthew, I’m so sleepy.",945
3265,I can’t go to school.,945
3266,I just know I couldn’t keep my eyes open and I’d be so stupid.,945
3267,"But I hate to stay home, for Gil--some of the others will get head of the class, and it’s so hard to get up again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up, haven’t you?”",945
3268,"“Well now, I guess you’ll manage all right,” said Matthew, looking at Anne’s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes.",946
3269,“You just go right to bed and have a good sleep.,946
3270,I’ll do all the chores.”,946
3271,"Anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the meantime, was sitting knitting.",947
3272,"“Oh, did you see the Premier?” exclaimed Anne at once.",948
3273,“What did he look like Marilla?”,948
3274,"“Well, he never got to be Premier on account of his looks,” said Marilla.",949
3275,“Such a nose as that man had!,949
3276,But he can speak.,949
3277,I was proud of being a Conservative.,949
3278,"Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no use for him.",949
3279,"Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry.",949
3280,I guess you’re hungry.,949
3281,Matthew has been telling me about last night.,949
3282,I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do.,949
3283,"I wouldn’t have had any idea myself, for I never saw a case of croup.",949
3284,"There now, never mind talking till you’ve had your dinner.",949
3285,"I can tell by the look of you that you’re just full up with speeches, but they’ll keep.”",949
3286,"Marilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then for she knew if she did Anne’s consequent excitement would lift her clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.",950
3287,Not until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:,950
3288,“Mrs.,951
3289,"Barry was here this afternoon, Anne.",951
3290,"She wanted to see you, but I wouldn’t wake you up.",951
3291,"She says you saved Minnie May’s life, and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine.",951
3292,"She says she knows now you didn’t mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes you’ll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again.",951
3293,You’re to go over this evening if you like for Diana can’t stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she caught last night.,951
3294,"Now, Anne Shirley, for pity’s sake don’t fly up into the air.”",951
3295,"The warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne’s expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated with the flame of her spirit.",952
3296,"“Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes?",953
3297,"I’ll wash them when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.”",953
3298,"“Yes, yes, run along,” said Marilla indulgently.",954
3299,“Anne Shirley--are you crazy?,954
3300,Come back this instant and put something on you.,954
3301,I might as well call to the wind.,954
3302,She’s gone without a cap or wrap.,954
3303,Look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming.,954
3304,It’ll be a mercy if she doesn’t catch her death of cold.”,954
3305,Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places.,955
3306,"Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce.",955
3307,"The tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne’s heart and on her lips.",955
3308,"“You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,” she announced.",956
3309,"“I’m perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair.",956
3310,Just at present I have a soul above red hair.,956
3311,Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me.,956
3312,"I felt fearfully embarrassed, Marilla, but I just said as politely as I could, ‘I have no hard feelings for you, Mrs. Barry.",956
3313,"I assure you once for all that I did not mean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion.’ That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn’t it, Marilla?”",956
3314,“I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry’s head.,957
3315,And Diana and I had a lovely afternoon.,957
3316,Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at Carmody taught her.,957
3317,"Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but us, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else.",957
3318,Diana gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry:”,957
3319,      “If you love me as I love you       Nothing but death can part us two.”,958
3320,"“And that is true, Marilla.",959
3321,"We’re going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us sit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.",959
3322,We had an elegant tea.,959
3323,"Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out, Marilla, just as if I was real company.",959
3324,I can’t tell you what a thrill it gave me.,959
3325,Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.,959
3326,"And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves, Marilla.",959
3327,"And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said ‘Pa, why don’t you pass the biscuits to Anne?’ It must be lovely to be grown up, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.”",959
3328,"“I don’t know about that,” said Marilla, with a brief sigh.",960
3329,"“Well, anyway, when I am grown up,” said Anne decidedly, “I’m always going to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I’ll never laugh when they use big words.",961
3330,I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one’s feelings.,961
3331,After tea Diana and I made taffy.,961
3332,"The taffy wasn’t very good, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.",961
3333,Diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away.,961
3334,But the making of it was splendid fun.,961
3335,Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Lover’s Lane.,961
3336,"I assure you, Marilla, that I feel like praying tonight and I’m going to think out a special brand-new prayer in honor of the occasion.”",961
3337, CHAPTER XIX.,963
3338,"A Concert, a Catastrophe, and a Confession",963
3339," MARILLA, can I go over to see Diana just for a minute?” asked Anne, running breathlessly down from the east gable one February evening.",964
3340,"“I don’t see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for,” said Marilla shortly.",965
3341,"“You and Diana walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more, your tongues going the whole blessed time, clickety-clack.",965
3342,So I don’t think you’re very badly off to see her again.”,965
3343,"“But she wants to see me,” pleaded Anne.",966
3344,“She has something very important to tell me.”,966
3345,“How do you know she has?”,967
3346,“Because she just signaled to me from her window.,968
3347,We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard.,968
3348,We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth.,968
3349,So many flashes mean a certain thing.,968
3350,"It was my idea, Marilla.”",968
3351,"“I’ll warrant you it was,” said Marilla emphatically.",969
3352,“And the next thing you’ll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense.”,969
3353,"“Oh, we’re very careful, Marilla.",970
3354,And it’s so interesting.,970
3355,"Two flashes mean, ‘Are you there?’ Three mean ‘yes’ and four ‘no.’ Five mean, ‘Come over as soon as possible, because I have something important to reveal.’ Diana has just signaled five flashes, and I’m really suffering to know what it is.”",970
3356,"“Well, you needn’t suffer any longer,” said Marilla sarcastically.",971
3357,"“You can go, but you’re to be back here in just ten minutes, remember that.”",971
3358,"Anne did remember it and was back in the stipulated time, although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of Diana’s important communication within the limits of ten minutes.",972
3359,But at least she had made good use of them.,972
3360,"“Oh, Marilla, what do you think?",973
3361,You know tomorrow is Diana’s birthday.,973
3362,"Well, her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her.",973
3363,And her cousins are coming over from Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall tomorrow night.,973
3364,"And they are going to take Diana and me to the concert--if you’ll let me go, that is.",973
3365,"You will, won’t you, Marilla?",973
3366,"Oh, I feel so excited.”",973
3367,"“You can calm down then, because you’re not going.",974
3368,"You’re better at home in your own bed, and as for that club concert, it’s all nonsense, and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all.”",974
3369,"“I’m sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair,” pleaded Anne.",975
3370,“I’m not saying it isn’t.,976
3371,But you’re not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night.,976
3372,Pretty doings for children.,976
3373,I’m surprised at Mrs. Barry’s letting Diana go.”,976
3374,"“But it’s such a very special occasion,” mourned Anne, on the verge of tears.",977
3375,“Diana has only one birthday in a year.,977
3376,"It isn’t as if birthdays were common things, Marilla.",977
3377,"Prissy Andrews is going to recite ‘Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight.’ That is such a good moral piece, Marilla, I’m sure it would do me lots of good to hear it.",977
3378,And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns.,977
3379,"And oh, Marilla, the minister is going to take part; yes, indeed, he is; he’s going to give an address.",977
3380,That will be just about the same thing as a sermon.,977
3381,"Please, mayn’t I go, Marilla?”",977
3382,"“You heard what I said, Anne, didn’t you?",978
3383,Take off your boots now and go to bed.,978
3384,It’s past eight.”,978
3385,"“There’s just one more thing, Marilla,” said Anne, with the air of producing the last shot in her locker.",979
3386,“Mrs.,979
3387,Barry told Diana that we might sleep in the spare-room bed.,979
3388,Think of the honor of your little Anne being put in the spare-room bed.”,979
3389,“It’s an honor you’ll have to get along without.,980
3390,"Go to bed, Anne, and don’t let me hear another word out of you.”",980
3391,"When Anne, with tears rolling over her cheeks, had gone sorrowfully upstairs, Matthew, who had been apparently sound asleep on the lounge during the whole dialogue, opened his eyes and said decidedly:",981
3392,"“Well now, Marilla, I think you ought to let Anne go.”",982
3393,"“I don’t then,” retorted Marilla.",983
3394,"“Who’s bringing this child up, Matthew, you or me?”",983
3395,"“Well now, you,” admitted Matthew.",984
3396,“Don’t interfere then.”,985
3397,"“Well now, I ain’t interfering.",986
3398,It ain’t interfering to have your own opinion.,986
3399,And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go.”,986
3400,"“You’d think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the notion, I’ve no doubt,” was Marilla’s amiable rejoinder.",987
3401,"“I might have let her spend the night with Diana, if that was all.",987
3402,But I don’t approve of this concert plan.,987
3403,"She’d go there and catch cold like as not, and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement.",987
3404,It would unsettle her for a week.,987
3405,"I understand that child’s disposition and what’s good for it better than you, Matthew.”",987
3406,"“I think you ought to let Anne go,” repeated Matthew firmly.",988
3407,"Argument was not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.",988
3408,Marilla gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence.,988
3409,"The next morning, when Anne was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry, Matthew paused on his way out to the barn to say to Marilla again:",988
3410,"“I think you ought to let Anne go, Marilla.”",989
3411,For a moment Marilla looked things not lawful to be uttered.,990
3412,Then she yielded to the inevitable and said tartly:,990
3413,"“Very well, she can go, since nothing else ‘ll please you.”",991
3414,"Anne flew out of the pantry, dripping dishcloth in hand.",992
3415,"“Oh, Marilla, Marilla, say those blessed words again.”",993
3416,“I guess once is enough to say them.,994
3417,This is Matthew’s doings and I wash my hands of it.,994
3418,"If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night, don’t blame me, blame Matthew.",994
3419,"Anne Shirley, you’re dripping greasy water all over the floor.",994
3420,I never saw such a careless child.”,994
3421,"“Oh, I know I’m a great trial to you, Marilla,” said Anne repentantly.",995
3422,“I make so many mistakes.,995
3423,"But then just think of all the mistakes I don’t make, although I might.",995
3424,I’ll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school.,995
3425,"Oh, Marilla, my heart was just set on going to that concert.",995
3426,"I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it.",995
3427,"You didn’t know just how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did.",995
3428,"Matthew understands me, and it’s so nice to be understood, Marilla.”",995
3429,Anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in school.,996
3430,Gilbert Blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out of sight in mental arithmetic.,996
3431,"Anne’s consequent humiliation was less than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the spare-room bed.",996
3432,She and Diana talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than Mr. Phillips dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion.,996
3433,"Anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school.",997
3434,"The Avonlea Debating Club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission ten cents, in aid of the library.",997
3435,"The Avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part.",997
3436,"Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go, except Carrie Sloane, whose father shared Marilla’s opinions about small girls going out to night concerts.",997
3437,Carrie Sloane cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living.,997
3438,For Anne the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself.,998
3439,They had a “perfectly elegant tea;” and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in Diana’s little room upstairs.,998
3440,Diana did Anne’s front hair in the new pompadour style and Anne tied Diana’s bows with the especial knack she possessed; and they experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair.,998
3441,"At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement.",998
3442,"True, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with Diana’s jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket.",999
3443,But she remembered in time that she had an imagination and could use it.,999
3444,"Then Diana’s cousins, the Murrays from Newbridge, came; they all crowded into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes.",1000
3445,"Anne reveled in the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners.",1000
3446,"There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire.",1000
3447,"Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.",1000
3448,"“Oh, Diana,” breathed Anne, squeezing Diana’s mittened hand under the fur robe, “isn’t it all like a beautiful dream?",1001
3449,Do I really look the same as usual?,1001
3450,I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks.”,1001
3451,"“You look awfully nice,” said Diana, who having just received a compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.",1002
3452,“You’ve got the loveliest color.”,1002
3453,"The program that night was a series of “thrills” for at least one listener in the audience, and, as Anne assured Diana, every succeeding thrill was thrillier than the last.",1003
3454,"When Prissy Andrews, attired in a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations in her hair--rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her--“climbed the slimy ladder, dark without one ray of light,” Anne shivered in luxurious sympathy; when the choir sang “Far Above the Gentle Daisies” Anne gazed at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels; when Sam Sloane proceeded to explain and illustrate “How Sockery Set a Hen” Anne laughed until people sitting near her laughed too, more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in Avonlea; and when Mr. Phillips gave Mark Antony’s oration over the dead body of Cæsar in the most heart-stirring tones--looking at Prissy Andrews at the end of every sentence--Anne felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led the way.",1003
3455,Only one number on the program failed to interest her.,1004
3456,"When Gilbert Blythe recited “Bingen on the Rhine” Anne picked up Rhoda Murray’s library book and read it until he had finished, when she sat rigidly stiff and motionless while Diana clapped her hands until they tingled.",1004
3457,"It was eleven when they got home, sated with dissipation, but with the exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come.",1005
3458,Everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent.,1005
3459,"Anne and Diana tiptoed into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened.",1005
3460,It was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate.,1005
3461,"“Let’s undress here,” said Diana.",1006
3462,“It’s so nice and warm.”,1006
3463,“Hasn’t it been a delightful time?” sighed Anne rapturously.,1007
3464,“It must be splendid to get up and recite there.,1007
3465,"Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it, Diana?”",1007
3466,"“Yes, of course, someday.",1008
3467,They’re always wanting the big scholars to recite.,1008
3468,Gilbert Blythe does often and he’s only two years older than us.,1008
3469,"Oh, Anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him?",1008
3470,"When he came to the line,",1008
3471,"           ‘There’s Another, _not_ a sister,’",1009
3472,he looked right down at you.”,1010
3473,"“Diana,” said Anne with dignity, “you are my bosom friend, but I cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person.",1011
3474,Are you ready for bed?,1011
3475,Let’s run a race and see who’ll get to the bed first.”,1011
3476,The suggestion appealed to Diana.,1012
3477,"The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same moment.",1012
3478,"And then--something--moved beneath them, there was a gasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents:",1012
3479,“Merciful goodness!”,1013
3480,Anne and Diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out of the room.,1014
3481,They only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.,1014
3482,"“Oh, who was it--_what_ was it?” whispered Anne, her teeth chattering with cold and fright.",1015
3483,"“It was Aunt Josephine,” said Diana, gasping with laughter.",1016
3484,"“Oh, Anne, it was Aunt Josephine, however she came to be there.",1016
3485,"Oh, and I know she will be furious.",1016
3486,"It’s dreadful--it’s really dreadful--but did you ever know anything so funny, Anne?”",1016
3487,“Who is your Aunt Josephine?”,1017
3488,“She’s father’s aunt and she lives in Charlottetown.,1018
3489,She’s awfully old--seventy anyhow--and I don’t believe she was _ever_ a little girl.,1018
3490,"We were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon.",1018
3491,"She’s awfully prim and proper and she’ll scold dreadfully about this, I know.",1018
3492,"Well, we’ll have to sleep with Minnie May--and you can’t think how she kicks.”",1018
3493,Miss Josephine Barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning.,1019
3494,Mrs. Barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.,1019
3495,“Did you have a good time last night?,1020
3496,"I tried to stay awake until you came home, for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all, but I was so tired I fell asleep.",1020
3497,"I hope you didn’t disturb your aunt, Diana.”",1020
3498,"Diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive smiles of guilty amusement across the table.",1021
3499,"Anne hurried home after breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when she went down to Mrs. Lynde’s on an errand for Marilla.",1021
3500,"“So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last night?” said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye.",1022
3501,“Mrs.,1022
3502,Barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody.,1022
3503,She’s feeling real worried over it.,1022
3504,"Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning--and Josephine Barry’s temper is no joke, I can tell you that.",1022
3505,She wouldn’t speak to Diana at all.”,1022
3506,"“It wasn’t Diana’s fault,” said Anne contritely.",1023
3507,“It was mine.,1023
3508,I suggested racing to see who would get into bed first.”,1023
3509,"“I knew it!” said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.",1024
3510,“I knew that idea came out of your head.,1024
3511,"Well, it’s made a nice lot of trouble, that’s what.",1024
3512,"Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but she declares she won’t stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow, Sunday and all as it is.",1024
3513,She’d have gone today if they could have taken her.,1024
3514,"She had promised to pay for a quarter’s music lessons for Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy.",1024
3515,"Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning.",1024
3516,The Barrys must feel cut up.,1024
3517,Old Miss Barry is rich and they’d like to keep on the good side of her.,1024
3518,"Of course, Mrs. Barry didn’t say just that to me, but I’m a pretty good judge of human nature, that’s what.”",1024
3519,"“I’m such an unlucky girl,” mourned Anne.",1025
3520,“I’m always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I’d shed my heart’s blood for--into them too.,1025
3521,"Can you tell me why it is so, Mrs. Lynde?”",1025
3522,"“It’s because you’re too heedless and impulsive, child, that’s what.",1026
3523,You never stop to think--whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moment’s reflection.”,1026
3524,"“Oh, but that’s the best of it,” protested Anne.",1027
3525,"“Something just flashes into your mind, so exciting, and you must out with it.",1027
3526,If you stop to think it over you spoil it all.,1027
3527,"Haven’t you never felt that yourself, Mrs. Lynde?”",1027
3528,"No, Mrs. Lynde had not.",1028
3529,She shook her head sagely.,1028
3530,"“You must learn to think a little, Anne, that’s what.",1029
3531,The proverb you need to go by is ‘Look before you leap’--especially into spare-room beds.”,1029
3532,"Mrs. Lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but Anne remained pensive.",1030
3533,"She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her eyes appeared very serious.",1030
3534,When she left Mrs. Lynde’s she took her way across the crusted fields to Orchard Slope.,1030
3535,Diana met her at the kitchen door.,1030
3536,"“Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn’t she?” whispered Anne.",1031
3537,"“Yes,” answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door.",1032
3538,"“She was fairly dancing with rage, Anne.",1032
3539,"Oh, how she scolded.",1032
3540,She said I was the worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up.,1032
3541,She says she won’t stay and I’m sure I don’t care.,1032
3542,But Father and Mother do.”,1032
3543,“Why didn’t you tell them it was my fault?” demanded Anne.,1033
3544,"“It’s likely I’d do such a thing, isn’t it?” said Diana with just scorn.",1034
3545,"“I’m no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame as you.”",1034
3546,"“Well, I’m going in to tell her myself,” said Anne resolutely.",1035
3547,Diana stared.,1036
3548,"“Anne Shirley, you’d never!",1037
3549,why--she’ll eat you alive!”,1037
3550,"“Don’t frighten me any more than I am frightened,” implored Anne.",1038
3551,“I’d rather walk up to a cannon’s mouth.,1038
3552,"But I’ve got to do it, Diana.",1038
3553,It was my fault and I’ve got to confess.,1038
3554,"I’ve had practice in confessing, fortunately.”",1038
3555,"“Well, she’s in the room,” said Diana.",1039
3556,“You can go in if you want to.,1039
3557,I wouldn’t dare.,1039
3558,And I don’t believe you’ll do a bit of good.”,1039
3559,"With this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to say, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.",1040
3560,A sharp “Come in” followed.,1040
3561,"Miss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by the fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her gold-rimmed glasses.",1041
3562,"She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see Diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.",1041
3563,"“Who are you?” demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.",1042
3564,"“I’m Anne of Green Gables,” said the small visitor tremulously, clasping her hands with her characteristic gesture, “and I’ve come to confess, if you please.”",1043
3565,“Confess what?”,1044
3566,“That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night.,1045
3567,I suggested it.,1045
3568,"Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.",1045
3569,"Diana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry.",1045
3570,So you must see how unjust it is to blame her.”,1045
3571,"“Oh, I must, hey?",1046
3572,I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at least.,1046
3573,Such carryings on in a respectable house!”,1046
3574,"“But we were only in fun,” persisted Anne.",1047
3575,"“I think you ought to forgive us, Miss Barry, now that we’ve apologized.",1047
3576,"And anyhow, please forgive Diana and let her have her music lessons.",1047
3577,"Diana’s heart is set on her music lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it.",1047
3578,"If you must be cross with anyone, be cross with me.",1047
3579,I’ve been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.”,1047
3580,Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady’s eyes by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest.,1048
3581,But she still said severely:,1048
3582,“I don’t think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.,1049
3583,Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young.,1049
3584,"You don’t know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long and arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.”",1049
3585,"“I don’t _know_, but I can _imagine_,” said Anne eagerly.",1050
3586,“I’m sure it must have been very disturbing.,1050
3587,"But then, there is our side of it too.",1050
3588,"Have you any imagination, Miss Barry?",1050
3589,"If you have, just put yourself in our place.",1050
3590,We didn’t know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death.,1050
3591,It was simply awful the way we felt.,1050
3592,And then we couldn’t sleep in the spare room after being promised.,1050
3593,I suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms.,1050
3594,But just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.”,1050
3595,All the snap had gone by this time.,1051
3596,"Miss Barry actually laughed--a sound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside, to give a great gasp of relief.",1051
3597,"“I’m afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it’s so long since I used it,” she said.",1052
3598,“I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine.,1052
3599,It all depends on the way we look at it.,1052
3600,Sit down here and tell me about yourself.”,1052
3601,"“I am very sorry I can’t,” said Anne firmly.",1053
3602,"“I would like to, because you seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred spirit although you don’t look very much like it.",1053
3603,But it is my duty to go home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert.,1053
3604,Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly.,1053
3605,"She is doing her best, but it is very discouraging work.",1053
3606,You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed.,1053
3607,But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.”,1053
3608,"“I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally,” said Miss Barry.",1054
3609,That evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.,1055
3610,"“I’ve made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better acquainted with that Anne-girl,” she said frankly.",1056
3611,"“She amuses me, and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.”",1056
3612,"Marilla’s only comment when she heard the story was, “I told you so.”  This was for Matthew’s benefit.",1057
3613,Miss Barry stayed her month out and over.,1058
3614,"She was a more agreeable guest than usual, for Anne kept her in good humor.",1058
3615,They became firm friends.,1058
3616,When Miss Barry went away she said:,1059
3617,"“Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you’re to visit me and I’ll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.”",1060
3618,"“Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,” Anne confided to Marilla.",1061
3619,"“You wouldn’t think so to look at her, but she is.",1061
3620,"You don’t find it right out at first, as in Matthew’s case, but after a while you come to see it.",1061
3621,Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think.,1061
3622,It’s splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.”,1061
3623, CHAPTER XX.,1063
3624,A Good Imagination Gone Wrong,1063
3625," SPRING had come once more to Green Gables--the beautiful capricious, reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth.",1064
3626,The maples in Lover’s Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad’s Bubble.,1064
3627,"Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane’s place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves.",1064
3628,"All the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming home in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil.",1064
3629,"“I’m so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers,” said Anne.",1065
3630,"“Diana says perhaps they have something better, but there couldn’t be anything better than Mayflowers, could there, Marilla?",1065
3631,And Diana says if they don’t know what they are like they don’t miss them.,1065
3632,But I think that is the saddest thing of all.,1065
3633,"I think it would be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_ to miss them.",1065
3634,"Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla?",1065
3635,I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven.,1065
3636,"But we had a splendid time today, Marilla.",1065
3637,We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.,1065
3638,"Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because he wouldn’t take a dare.",1065
3639,Nobody would in school.,1065
3640,It is very _fashionable_ to dare.,1065
3641,"Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews and I heard him to say ‘sweets to the sweet.’ He got that out of a book, I know; but it shows he has some imagination.",1065
3642,"I was offered some Mayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn.",1065
3643,I can’t tell you the person’s name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips.,1065
3644,"We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two, with our bouquets and wreaths, singing ‘My Home on the Hill.’ Oh, it was so thrilling, Marilla.",1065
3645,All Mr. Silas Sloane’s folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us.,1065
3646,We made a real sensation.”,1065
3647,“Not much wonder!,1066
3648,Such silly doings!” was Marilla’s response.,1066
3649,"After the Mayflowers came the violets, and Violet Vale was empurpled with them.",1067
3650,"Anne walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eyes, as if she trod on holy ground.",1067
3651,"“Somehow,” she told Diana, “when I’m going through here I don’t really care whether Gil--whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not.",1068
3652,But when I’m up in school it’s all different and I care as much as ever.,1068
3653,There’s such a lot of different Annes in me.,1068
3654,I sometimes think that is why I’m such a troublesome person.,1068
3655,"If I was just the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn’t be half so interesting.”",1068
3656,"One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window.",1069
3657,"She had been studying her lessons, but it had grown too dark to see the book, so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie, looking out past the boughs of the Snow Queen, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom.",1069
3658,In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged.,1070
3659,"The walls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly and yellowly upright as ever.",1070
3660,Yet the whole character of the room was altered.,1070
3661,"It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table.",1070
3662,"It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine.",1070
3663,Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne’s freshly ironed school aprons.,1070
3664,She hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh.,1070
3665,"She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and although the pain had gone she felt weak and “tuckered out,” as she expressed it.",1070
3666,Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.,1070
3667,"“I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place, Marilla.",1071
3668,I would have endured it joyfully for your sake.”,1071
3669,"“I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest,” said Marilla.",1072
3670,“You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual.,1072
3671,Of course it wasn’t exactly necessary to starch Matthew’s handkerchiefs!,1072
3672,And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp.,1072
3673,But that doesn’t seem to be your way evidently.”,1072
3674,Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.,1073
3675,"“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Anne penitently.",1074
3676,"“I never thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now, although I felt _instinctively_ that there was something missing on the dinner table.",1074
3677,"I was firmly resolved, when you left me in charge this morning, not to imagine anything, but keep my thoughts on facts.",1074
3678,"I did pretty well until I put the pie in, and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed.",1074
3679,So that is how I came to forget the pie.,1074
3680,I didn’t know I starched the handkerchiefs.,1074
3681,All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook.,1074
3682,"It’s the most ravishing spot, Marilla.",1074
3683,There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it.,1074
3684,At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen’s birthday.,1074
3685,Both Diana and I are very loyal.,1074
3686,But I’m sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs.,1074
3687,I wanted to be extra good today because it’s an anniversary.,1074
3688,"Do you remember what happened this day last year, Marilla?”",1074
3689,"“No, I can’t think of anything special.”",1075
3690,"“Oh, Marilla, it was the day I came to Green Gables.",1076
3691,I shall never forget it.,1076
3692,It was the turning point in my life.,1076
3693,Of course it wouldn’t seem so important to you.,1076
3694,I’ve been here for a year and I’ve been so happy.,1076
3695,"Of course, I’ve had my troubles, but one can live down troubles.",1076
3696,"Are you sorry you kept me, Marilla?”",1076
3697,"“No, I can’t say I’m sorry,” said Marilla, who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before Anne came to Green Gables, “no, not exactly sorry.",1077
3698,"If you’ve finished your lessons, Anne, I want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she’ll lend me Diana’s apron pattern.”",1077
3699,"“Oh--it’s--it’s too dark,” cried Anne.",1078
3700,“Too dark?,1079
3701,"Why, it’s only twilight.",1079
3702,And goodness knows you’ve gone over often enough after dark.”,1079
3703,"“I’ll go over early in the morning,” said Anne eagerly.",1080
3704,"“I’ll get up at sunrise and go over, Marilla.”",1080
3705,"“What has got into your head now, Anne Shirley?",1081
3706,I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening.,1081
3707,Go at once and be smart too.”,1081
3708,"“I’ll have to go around by the road, then,” said Anne, taking up her hat reluctantly.",1082
3709,“Go by the road and waste half an hour!,1083
3710,I’d like to catch you!”,1083
3711,"“I can’t go through the Haunted Wood, Marilla,” cried Anne desperately.",1084
3712,Marilla stared.,1085
3713,“The Haunted Wood!,1086
3714,Are you crazy?,1086
3715,What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood?”,1086
3716,"“The spruce wood over the brook,” said Anne in a whisper.",1087
3717,“Fiddlesticks!,1088
3718,There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere.,1088
3719,Who has been telling you such stuff?”,1088
3720,"“Nobody,” confessed Anne.",1089
3721,“Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted.,1089
3722,All the places around here are so--so--_commonplace_.,1089
3723,We just got this up for our own amusement.,1089
3724,We began it in April.,1089
3725,"A haunted wood is so very romantic, Marilla.",1089
3726,We chose the spruce grove because it’s so gloomy.,1089
3727,"Oh, we have imagined the most harrowing things.",1089
3728,There’s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries.,1089
3729,She appears when there is to be a death in the family.,1089
3730,And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand--so.,1089
3731,"Oh, Marilla, it gives me a shudder to think of it.",1089
3732,And there’s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs.,1089
3733,"Oh, Marilla, I wouldn’t go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything.",1089
3734,I’d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.”,1089
3735,"“Did ever anyone hear the like!” ejaculated Marilla, who had listened in dumb amazement.",1090
3736,"“Anne Shirley, do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?”",1090
3737,"“Not believe _exactly_,” faltered Anne.",1091
3738,"“At least, I don’t believe it in daylight.",1091
3739,"But after dark, Marilla, it’s different.",1091
3740,That is when ghosts walk.”,1091
3741,"“There are no such things as ghosts, Anne.”",1092
3742,"“Oh, but there are, Marilla,” cried Anne eagerly.",1093
3743,“I know people who have seen them.,1093
3744,And they are respectable people.,1093
3745,Charlie Sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he’d been buried for a year.,1093
3746,You know Charlie Sloane’s grandmother wouldn’t tell a story for anything.,1093
3747,She’s a very religious woman.,1093
3748,And Mrs. Thomas’s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin.,1093
3749,He said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days.,1093
3750,"He didn’t, but he died two years after, so you see it was really true.",1093
3751,And Ruby Gillis says--”,1093
3752,"“Anne Shirley,” interrupted Marilla firmly, “I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again.",1094
3753,"I’ve had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along, and if this is going to be the outcome of it, I won’t countenance any such doings.",1094
3754,"You’ll go right over to Barry’s, and you’ll go through that spruce grove, just for a lesson and a warning to you.",1094
3755,And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again.”,1094
3756,"Anne might plead and cry as she liked--and did, for her terror was very real.",1095
3757,Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall.,1095
3758,But Marilla was inexorable.,1095
3759,She marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond.,1095
3760,"“Oh, Marilla, how can you be so cruel?” sobbed Anne.",1096
3761,“What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?”,1096
3762,"“I’ll risk it,” said Marilla unfeelingly.",1097
3763,“You know I always mean what I say.,1097
3764,I’ll cure you of imagining ghosts into places.,1097
3765,"March, now.”",1097
3766,Anne marched.,1098
3767,"That is, she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond.",1098
3768,Anne never forgot that walk.,1098
3769,Bitterly did she repent the license she had given to her imagination.,1098
3770,"The goblins of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold, fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being.",1098
3771,A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still.,1098
3772,The long-drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration in beads on her forehead.,1098
3773,The swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures.,1098
3774,"When she reached Mr. William Bell’s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.",1098
3775,Diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger.,1098
3776,The dreadful return journey had to be faced.,1098
3777,"Anne went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing.",1098
3778,When she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief.,1098
3779,"“Well, so nothing caught you?” said Marilla unsympathetically.",1099
3780,"“Oh, Mar--Marilla,” chattered Anne, “I’ll b-b-be contt-tented with c-c-commonplace places after this.”",1100
3781, CHAPTER XXI.,1102
3782,A New Departure in Flavorings,1102
3783," DEAR me, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,” remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red eyes with a very damp handkerchief.",1103
3784,"“Wasn’t it fortunate, Marilla, that I took an extra handkerchief to school today?",1103
3785,I had a presentiment that it would be needed.”,1103
3786,"“I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you’d require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,” said Marilla.",1104
3787,"“I don’t think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,”  reflected Anne.",1105
3788,“I just cried because all the others did.,1105
3789,It was Ruby Gillis started it.,1105
3790,"Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears.",1105
3791,"Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.",1105
3792,"I tried to hold out, Marilla.",1105
3793,"I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name without an ‘e’ on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn’t, Marilla, and I just had to cry too.",1105
3794,Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she’d be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she’d never shed a tear.,1105
3795,"Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn’t cry--because she hadn’t brought one of her own, not expecting to need it.",1105
3796,"Oh, Marilla, it was heartrending.",1105
3797,"Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning, ‘The time has come for us to part.’ It was very affecting.",1105
3798,"And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla.",1105
3799,"Oh, I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I’d talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.",1105
3800,I can tell you I wished I’d been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews.,1105
3801,She hadn’t anything on her conscience.,1105
3802,The girls cried all the way home from school.,1105
3803,"Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, ‘The time has come for us to part,’ and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up.",1105
3804,"I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla.",1105
3805,"But one can’t feel quite in the depths of despair with two months’ vacation before them, can they, Marilla?",1105
3806,"And besides, we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station.",1105
3807,"For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I couldn’t help taking a little interest in a new minister, could I?",1105
3808,His wife is very pretty.,1105
3809,"Not exactly regally lovely, of course--it wouldn’t do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally lovely wife, because it might set a bad example.",1105
3810,Mrs. Lynde says the minister’s wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably.,1105
3811,Our new minister’s wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.,1105
3812,"Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister’s wife, but I didn’t make any such uncharitable remark, Marilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves.",1105
3813,"Besides, she’s only been a minister’s wife for a little while, so one should make allowances, shouldn’t they?",1105
3814,They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready.”,1105
3815,"If Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde’s that evening, was actuated by any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had borrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the Avonlea people.",1106
3816,"Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes never expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof.",1106
3817,"A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife, was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between.",1106
3818,"Old Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in imagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years.",1107
3819,"He was a widower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year of his sojourn.",1107
3820,"In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator.",1107
3821,Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and “supplies” who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial.,1107
3822,"These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers in Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form.",1107
3823,"“I don’t think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew” was Anne’s final summing up.",1108
3824,“Mrs.,1108
3825,"Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley’s--he had no imagination.",1108
3826,And Mr. Terry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood.,1108
3827,"Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology wasn’t sound.",1108
3828,"Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man, but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church; he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister, mustn’t you, Matthew?",1108
3829,"I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive; but Mrs. Lynde says he isn’t married, or even engaged, because she made special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble.",1108
3830,"Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman, isn’t she, Matthew?",1108
3831,I’m very glad they’ve called Mr. Allan.,1108
3832,I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.,1108
3833,"Mrs. Lynde says he isn’t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn’t expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine.",1108
3834,And she knows his wife’s people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers.,1108
3835,Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a minister’s family.”,1108
3836,"The new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework.",1109
3837,Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.,1109
3838,"Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals, and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse.",1109
3839,With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.,1109
3840,She had discovered another kindred spirit.,1109
3841,“Mrs.,1110
3842,"Allan is perfectly lovely,” she announced one Sunday afternoon.",1110
3843,“She’s taken our class and she’s a splendid teacher.,1110
3844,"She said right away she didn’t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions, and you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I’ve always thought.",1110
3845,She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.,1110
3846,"I’m good at asking questions, Marilla.”",1110
3847,"“I believe you,” was Marilla’s emphatic comment.",1111
3848,"“Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer.",1112
3849,I didn’t think that was a very proper question to ask because it hadn’t any connection with the lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions’ den--but Mrs. Allan just smiled and said she thought there would be.,1112
3850,Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks.,1112
3851,"I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, Marilla.",1112
3852,"I’m not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet.",1112
3853,If I had perhaps I could influence people for good.,1112
3854,Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good.,1112
3855,She talked so nice about everything.,1112
3856,I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing.,1112
3857,"I always thought it was kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan’s isn’t, and I’d like to be a Christian if I could be one like her.",1112
3858,I wouldn’t want to be one like Mr.,1112
3859,Superintendent Bell.”,1112
3860,"“It’s very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,” said Marilla severely.",1113
3861,“Mr.,1113
3862,Bell is a real good man.”,1113
3863,"“Oh, of course he’s good,” agreed Anne, “but he doesn’t seem to get any comfort out of it.",1114
3864,If I could be good I’d dance and sing all day because I was glad of it.,1114
3865,I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it wouldn’t be dignified in a minister’s wife.,1114
3866,But I can just feel she’s glad she’s a Christian and that she’d be one even if she could get to heaven without it.”,1114
3867,"“I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,” said Marilla reflectively.",1115
3868,“They’ve been most everywhere but here.,1115
3869,Let me see.,1115
3870,Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them.,1115
3871,"But don’t say a word to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he’d find some excuse to be away that day.",1115
3872,"He’d got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn’t mind him, but he’s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister, and a new minister’s wife will frighten him to death.”",1115
3873,"“I’ll be as secret as the dead,” assured Anne.",1116
3874,"“But oh, Marilla, will you let me make a cake for the occasion?",1116
3875,"I’d love to do something for Mrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.”",1116
3876,"“You can make a layer cake,” promised Marilla.",1117
3877,Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.,1118
3878,"Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers.",1118
3879,Anne was wild with excitement and delight.,1118
3880,"She talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryad’s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.",1118
3881,"“Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I’m to make in the morning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before teatime.",1119
3882,"I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of it.",1119
3883,It’s such a responsibility having a minister’s family to tea.,1119
3884,I never went through such an experience before.,1119
3885,You should just see our pantry.,1119
3886,It’s a sight to behold.,1119
3887,We’re going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue.,1119
3888,"We’re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and fruit cake, and Marilla’s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister is dyspeptic and can’t eat new.",1119
3889,"Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic, but I don’t think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him.",1119
3890,I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake.,1119
3891,"Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn’t be good!",1119
3892,I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.”,1119
3893,"“It’ll be good, all right,” assured Diana, who was a very comfortable sort of friend.",1120
3894,“I’m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.”,1120
3895,"“Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good,” sighed Anne, setting a particularly well-balsamed twig afloat.",1121
3896,"“However, I suppose I shall just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour.",1121
3897,"Oh, look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow!",1121
3898,Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf?”,1121
3899,"“You know there is no such thing as a dryad,” said Diana.",1122
3900,Diana’s mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it.,1122
3901,As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads.,1122
3902,"“But it’s so easy to imagine there is,” said Anne.",1123
3903,"“Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror.",1123
3904,Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning.,1123
3905,"Oh, Diana, don’t give up your faith in the dryad!”",1123
3906,Wednesday morning came.,1124
3907,Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep.,1124
3908,She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning.,1124
3909,After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.,1124
3910,When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.,1124
3911,"“I’m sure I haven’t forgotten anything this time, Marilla.",1125
3912,But do you think it will rise?,1125
3913,Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn’t good?,1125
3914,I used it out of the new can.,1125
3915,And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.,1125
3916,"Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says we’ll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it.",1125
3917,"Marilla, what if that cake doesn’t rise?”",1125
3918,“We’ll have plenty without it” was Marilla’s unimpassioned way of looking at the subject.,1126
3919,"The cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam.",1127
3920,"Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it and possibly asking for another piece!",1127
3921,"“You’ll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,” she said.",1128
3922,“Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?”,1128
3923,"“I think that’s all nonsense,” sniffed Marilla.",1129
3924,“In my opinion it’s the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.”,1129
3925,“Mrs.,1130
3926,"Barry had _her_ table decorated,” said Anne, who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, “and the minister paid her an elegant compliment.",1130
3927,He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate.”,1130
3928,"“Well, do as you like,” said Marilla, who was quite determined not to be surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else.",1131
3929,“Only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food.”,1131
3930,Anne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave Mrs. Barry’s nowhere.,1132
3931,"Having abundance of roses and ferns and a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a thing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.",1132
3932,"“It’s Anne’s doings,” said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs. Allan’s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.",1133
3933,"Matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness and Anne knew how.",1134
3934,"He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.",1134
3935,"He never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be expected.",1134
3936,All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne’s layer cake was passed.,1135
3937,"Mrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety, declined it.",1135
3938,"But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne’s face, said smilingly:",1135
3939,"“Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan.",1136
3940,Anne made it on purpose for you.”,1136
3941,"“In that case I must sample it,” laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to a plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.",1137
3942,"Mrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away at it.",1138
3943,Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.,1138
3944,"“Anne Shirley!” she exclaimed, “what on earth did you put into that cake?”",1139
3945,"“Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,” cried Anne with a look of anguish.",1140
3946,"“Oh, isn’t it all right?”",1140
3947,“All right!,1141
3948,It’s simply horrible.,1141
3949,"Mr. Allan, don’t try to eat it.",1141
3950,"Anne, taste it yourself.",1141
3951,What flavoring did you use?”,1141
3952,"“Vanilla,” said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting the cake.",1142
3953,“Only vanilla.,1142
3954,"Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking powder.",1142
3955,I had my suspicions of that bak--”,1142
3956,“Baking powder fiddlesticks!,1143
3957,Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used.”,1143
3958,"Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, “Best Vanilla.”",1144
3959,"Marilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.",1145
3960,"“Mercy on us, Anne, you’ve flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_.",1146
3961,I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle.,1146
3962,I suppose it’s partly my fault--I should have warned you--but for pity’s sake why couldn’t you have smelled it?”,1146
3963,Anne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.,1147
3964,"“I couldn’t--I had such a cold!” and with this she fairly fled to the gable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted.",1148
3965,Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room.,1149
3966,"“Oh, Marilla,” sobbed Anne, without looking up, “I’m disgraced forever.",1150
3967,I shall never be able to live this down.,1150
3968,It will get out--things always do get out in Avonlea.,1150
3969,Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I shall have to tell her the truth.,1150
3970,I shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment.,1150
3971,Gil--the boys in school will never get over laughing at it.,1150
3972,"Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark of Christian pity don’t tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after this.",1150
3973,"I’ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but I cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again.",1150
3974,Perhaps she’ll think I tried to poison her.,1150
3975,Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor.,1150
3976,But the liniment isn’t poisonous.,1150
3977,It’s meant to be taken internally--although not in cakes.,1150
3978,"Won’t you tell Mrs. Allan so, Marilla?”",1150
3979,"“Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,” said a merry voice.",1151
3980,"Anne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with laughing eyes.",1152
3981,"“My dear little girl, you mustn’t cry like this,” she said, genuinely disturbed by Anne’s tragic face.",1153
3982,"“Why, it’s all just a funny mistake that anybody might make.”",1153
3983,"“Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,” said Anne forlornly.",1154
3984,"“And I wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.”",1154
3985,"“Yes, I know, dear.",1155
3986,And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right.,1155
3987,"Now, you mustn’t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower garden.",1155
3988,Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own.,1155
3989,"I want to see it, for I’m very much interested in flowers.”",1155
3990,"Anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it was really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit.",1156
3991,"Nothing more was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away Anne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected, considering that terrible incident.",1156
3992,"Nevertheless, she sighed deeply.",1156
3993,"“Marilla, isn’t it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?”",1157
3994,"“I’ll warrant you’ll make plenty in it,” said Marilla.",1158
3995,"“I never saw your beat for making mistakes, Anne.”",1158
3996,"“Yes, and well I know it,” admitted Anne mournfully.",1159
3997,"“But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla?",1159
3998,I never make the same mistake twice.”,1159
3999,“I don’t know as that’s much benefit when you’re always making new ones.”,1160
4000,"“Oh, don’t you see, Marilla?",1161
4001,"There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I’ll be through with them.",1161
4002,That’s a very comforting thought.”,1161
4003,"“Well, you’d better go and give that cake to the pigs,” said Marilla.",1162
4004,"“It isn’t fit for any human to eat, not even Jerry Boute.”",1162
4005, CHAPTER XXII.,1164
4006,Anne Is Invited Out to Tea,1164
4007, AND what are your eyes popping out of your head about.,1165
4008,"Now?” asked Marilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office.",1165
4009,"“Have you discovered another kindred spirit?” Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature.",1165
4010,"She had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.",1165
4011,"“No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think?",1166
4012,I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon!,1166
4013,Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office.,1166
4014,"Just look at it, Marilla.",1166
4015,"‘Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.’ That is the first time I was ever called ‘Miss.’ Such a thrill as it gave me!",1166
4016,I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.”,1166
4017,“Mrs.,1167
4018,"Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her Sunday-school class to tea in turn,” said Marilla, regarding the wonderful event very coolly.",1167
4019,“You needn’t get in such a fever over it.,1167
4020,"Do learn to take things calmly, child.”",1167
4021,For Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature.,1168
4022,"All “spirit and fire and dew,” as she was, the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity.",1168
4023,"Marilla felt this and was vaguely troubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate.",1168
4024,Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill Anne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows.,1168
4025,"She did not make much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself.",1168
4026,The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into “deeps of affliction.” The fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight.,1168
4027,Marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment.,1168
4028,Neither would she have believed that she really liked Anne much better as she was.,1168
4029,Anne went to bed that night speechless with misery because Matthew had said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow.,1169
4030,"The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her, it sounded so like pattering raindrops, and the full, faraway roar of the gulf, to which she listened delightedly at other times, loving its strange, sonorous, haunting rhythm, now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day.",1169
4031,Anne thought that the morning would never come.,1169
4032,"But all things have an end, even nights before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse.",1170
4033,"The morning, in spite of Matthew’s predictions, was fine and Anne’s spirits soared to their highest.",1170
4034,"“Oh, Marilla, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see,” she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes.",1170
4035,“You don’t know how good I feel!,1170
4036,Wouldn’t it be nice if it could last?,1170
4037,I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day.,1170
4038,"But oh, Marilla, it’s a solemn occasion too.",1170
4039,I feel so anxious.,1170
4040,What if I shouldn’t behave properly?,1170
4041,"You know I never had tea at a manse before, and I’m not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette, although I’ve been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I came here.",1170
4042,I’m so afraid I’ll do something silly or forget to do something I should do.,1170
4043,Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_ much?”,1170
4044,"“The trouble with you, Anne, is that you’re thinking too much about yourself.",1171
4045,"You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her,” said Marilla, hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice.",1171
4046,Anne instantly realized this.,1171
4047,"“You are right, Marilla.",1172
4048,I’ll try not to think about myself at all.”,1172
4049,"Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of “etiquette,” for she came home through the twilight, under a great, high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in Marilla’s gingham lap.",1173
4050,A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars.,1174
4051,"One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover’s Lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs.",1174
4052,Anne watched them as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.,1174
4053,"“Oh, Marilla, I’ve had a most _fascinating_ time.",1175
4054,I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again.,1175
4055,When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door.,1175
4056,"She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph.",1175
4057,"I really think I’d like to be a minister’s wife when I grow up, Marilla.",1175
4058,A minister mightn’t mind my red hair because he wouldn’t be thinking of such worldly things.,1175
4059,"But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I’ll never be that, so I suppose there’s no use in thinking about it.",1175
4060,"Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not.",1175
4061,I’m one of the others.,1175
4062,Mrs. Lynde says I’m full of original sin.,1175
4063,No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good.,1175
4064,"It’s a good deal like geometry, I expect.",1175
4065,But don’t you think the trying so hard ought to count for something?,1175
4066,Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people.,1175
4067,I love her passionately.,1175
4068,"You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble.",1175
4069,"And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love.",1175
4070,"You know you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget.",1175
4071,"There was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday-school.",1175
4072,"Her name was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little girl.",1175
4073,"Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice.",1175
4074,"We had an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well.",1175
4075,After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.,1175
4076,Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this.,1175
4077,You can’t think how I was thrilled at the mere thought.,1175
4078,"I’ve longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.",1175
4079,Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it.,1175
4080,"Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite.",1175
4081,Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday.,1175
4082,I just gazed at her in awe.,1175
4083,After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk.,1175
4084,I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry.,1175
4085,"And would you believe it, Marilla?",1175
4086,Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too.,1175
4087,You don’t know how that encouraged me.,1175
4088,"Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla?",1175
4089,The trustees have hired a new teacher and it’s a lady.,1175
4090,Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy.,1175
4091,Isn’t that a romantic name?,1175
4092,Mrs. Lynde says they’ve never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation.,1175
4093,"But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don’t see how I’m going to live through the two weeks before school begins.",1175
4094,I’m so impatient to see her.”,1175
4095, CHAPTER XXIII.,1177
4096,Anne Comes to Grief in an Affair of Honor,1177
4097," ANNE had to live through more than two weeks, as it happened.",1178
4098,"Almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs’ bucket, and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie, not really being worth counting.",1178
4099,A week after the tea at the manse Diana Barry gave a party.,1179
4100,"“Small and select,” Anne assured Marilla.",1180
4101,“Just the girls in our class.”,1180
4102,"They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea, when they found themselves in the Barry garden, a little tired of all their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself.",1181
4103,This presently took the form of “daring.”,1181
4104,Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just then.,1182
4105,"It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were “dared” to do them would fill a book by themselves.",1182
4106,"First of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis, albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the aforesaid Carrie Sloane.",1183
4107,"Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.",1183
4108,"Josie’s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted, Anne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east.",1184
4109,"Now, to “walk” board fences requires more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never tried it.",1184
4110,"But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities that make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly cultivated, for walking board fences.",1184
4111,"Josie walked the Barry fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that wasn’t worth a “dare.” Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things themselves in their efforts to walk fences.",1184
4112,"Josie descended from her perch, flushed with victory, and darted a defiant glance at Anne.",1184
4113,Anne tossed her red braids.,1185
4114,"“I don’t think it’s such a very wonderful thing to walk a little, low, board fence,” she said.",1186
4115,“I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof.”,1186
4116,"“I don’t believe it,” said Josie flatly.",1187
4117,“I don’t believe anybody could walk a ridgepole.,1187
4118,"_You_ couldn’t, anyhow.”",1187
4119,“Couldn’t I?” cried Anne rashly.,1188
4120,"“Then I dare you to do it,” said Josie defiantly.",1189
4121,“I dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry’s kitchen roof.”,1189
4122,"Anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done.",1190
4123,"She walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof.",1190
4124,"All the fifth-class girls said, “Oh!” partly in excitement, partly in dismay.",1190
4125,"“Don’t you do it, Anne,” entreated Diana.",1191
4126,“You’ll fall off and be killed.,1191
4127,Never mind Josie Pye.,1191
4128,It isn’t fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous.”,1191
4129,“I must do it.,1192
4130,"My honor is at stake,” said Anne solemnly.",1192
4131,"“I shall walk that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt.",1192
4132,If I am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring.”,1192
4133,"Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much.",1193
4134,"Nevertheless, she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came.",1193
4135,"Then she swayed, lost her balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper beneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous, terrified shriek.",1193
4136,If Anne had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended Diana would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there.,1194
4137,"Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing.",1194
4138,"Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper.",1194
4139,"“Anne, are you killed?” shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees beside her friend.",1195
4140,"“Oh, Anne, dear Anne, speak just one word to me and tell me if you’re killed.”",1195
4141,"To the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of Josie Pye, who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of Anne Shirley’s early and tragic death, Anne sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly:",1196
4142,"“No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.”",1197
4143,“Where?” sobbed Carrie Sloane.,1198
4144,"“Oh, where, Anne?” Before Anne could answer Mrs. Barry appeared on the scene.",1198
4145,"At sight of her Anne tried to scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain.",1198
4146,“What’s the matter?,1199
4147,Where have you hurt yourself?” demanded Mrs. Barry.,1199
4148,"“My ankle,” gasped Anne.",1200
4149,"“Oh, Diana, please find your father and ask him to take me home.",1200
4150,I know I can never walk there.,1200
4151,And I’m sure I couldn’t hop so far on one foot when Jane couldn’t even hop around the garden.”,1200
4152,"Marilla was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she saw Mr. Barry coming over the log bridge and up the slope, with Mrs. Barry beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him.",1201
4153,"In his arms he carried Anne, whose head lay limply against his shoulder.",1201
4154,At that moment Marilla had a revelation.,1202
4155,In the sudden stab of fear that pierced her very heart she realized what Anne had come to mean to her.,1202
4156,"She would have admitted that she liked Anne--nay, that she was very fond of Anne.",1202
4157,But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne was dearer to her than anything else on earth.,1202
4158,“Mr.,1203
4159,"Barry, what has happened to her?” she gasped, more white and shaken than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years.",1203
4160,"Anne herself answered, lifting her head.",1204
4161,"“Don’t be very frightened, Marilla.",1205
4162,I was walking the ridgepole and I fell off.,1205
4163,I expect I have sprained my ankle.,1205
4164,"But, Marilla, I might have broken my neck.",1205
4165,Let us look on the bright side of things.”,1205
4166,"“I might have known you’d go and do something of the sort when I let you go to that party,” said Marilla, sharp and shrewish in her very relief.",1206
4167,"“Bring her in here, Mr. Barry, and lay her on the sofa.",1206
4168,"Mercy me, the child has gone and fainted!”",1206
4169,It was quite true.,1207
4170,"Overcome by the pain of her injury, Anne had one more of her wishes granted to her.",1207
4171,She had fainted dead away.,1207
4172,"Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway dispatched for the doctor, who in due time came, to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed.",1208
4173,Anne’s ankle was broken.,1208
4174,"That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed.",1209
4175,"“Aren’t you very sorry for me, Marilla?”",1210
4176,"“It was your own fault,” said Marilla, twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp.",1211
4177,"“And that is just why you should be sorry for me,” said Anne, “because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard.",1212
4178,If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better.,1212
4179,"But what would you have done, Marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?”",1212
4180,“I’d have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away.,1213
4181,Such absurdity!” said Marilla.,1213
4182,Anne sighed.,1214
4183,"“But you have such strength of mind, Marilla.",1215
4184,I haven’t.,1215
4185,I just felt that I couldn’t bear Josie Pye’s scorn.,1215
4186,She would have crowed over me all my life.,1215
4187,"And I think I have been punished so much that you needn’t be very cross with me, Marilla.",1215
4188,"It’s not a bit nice to faint, after all.",1215
4189,And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle.,1215
4190,I won’t be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I’ll miss the new lady teacher.,1215
4191,She won’t be new any more by the time I’m able to go to school.,1215
4192,And Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class.,1215
4193,"Oh, I am an afflicted mortal.",1215
4194,"But I’ll try to bear it all bravely if only you won’t be cross with me, Marilla.”",1215
4195,"“There, there, I’m not cross,” said Marilla.",1216
4196,"“You’re an unlucky child, there’s no doubt about that; but as you say, you’ll have the suffering of it.",1216
4197,"Here now, try and eat some supper.”",1216
4198,“Isn’t it fortunate I’ve got such an imagination?” said Anne.,1217
4199,"“It will help me through splendidly, I expect.",1217
4200,"What do people who haven’t any imagination do when they break their bones, do you suppose, Marilla?”",1217
4201,Anne had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during the tedious seven weeks that followed.,1218
4202,But she was not solely dependent on it.,1218
4203,She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her all the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea.,1218
4204,"“Everybody has been so good and kind, Marilla,” sighed Anne happily, on the day when she could first limp across the floor.",1219
4205,"“It isn’t very pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, Marilla.",1219
4206,You find out how many friends you have.,1219
4207,"Why, even Superintendent Bell came to see me, and he’s really a very fine man.",1219
4208,"Not a kindred spirit, of course; but still I like him and I’m awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers.",1219
4209,"I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he didn’t.",1219
4210,He could get over that if he’d take a little trouble.,1219
4211,I gave him a good broad hint.,1219
4212,I told him how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting.,1219
4213,He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy.,1219
4214,It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy.,1219
4215,"Even my imagination has its limits, for I can’t imagine _that_.",1219
4216,"When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he looks in Sunday-school, only small.",1219
4217,"Now, it’s so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl.",1219
4218,Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen times.,1219
4219,"Isn’t that something to be proud of, Marilla?",1219
4220,When a minister’s wife has so many claims on her time!,1219
4221,"She is such a cheerful person to have visit you, too.",1219
4222,She never tells you it’s your own fault and she hopes you’ll be a better girl on account of it.,1219
4223,Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I’d be a better girl but didn’t really believe I would.,1219
4224,Even Josie Pye came to see me.,1219
4225,"I received her as politely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole.",1219
4226,If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life.,1219
4227,Diana has been a faithful friend.,1219
4228,She’s been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow.,1219
4229,"But oh, I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I’ve heard such exciting things about the new teacher.",1219
4230,The girls all think she is perfectly sweet.,1219
4231,Diana says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes.,1219
4232,"She dresses beautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else’s in Avonlea.",1219
4233,Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue.,1219
4234,"Oh, it’s just glorious to think of it.",1219
4235,Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination.,1219
4236,"Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue, called ‘A Morning Visit,’ for next Friday.",1219
4237,And the Friday afternoons they don’t have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a ‘field’ day and they study ferns and flowers and birds.,1219
4238,And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening.,1219
4239,Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher.,1219
4240,But I think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.”,1219
4241,"“There’s one thing plain to be seen, Anne,” said Marilla, “and that is that your fall off the Barry roof hasn’t injured your tongue at all.”",1220
4242, CHAPTER XXIV.,1222
4243,Miss Stacy and Her Pupils Get Up a Concert,1222
4244," IT was October again when Anne was ready to go back to school--a glorious October, all red and gold, with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain--amethyst, pearl, silver, rose, and smoke-blue.",1223
4245,The dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many-stemmed woods to run crisply through.,1223
4246,The Birch Path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it.,1223
4247,"There was a tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping, unlike snails, swiftly and willingly to school; and it _was_ jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis nodding across the aisle and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia Bell passing a “chew” of gum down from the back seat.",1223
4248,Anne drew a long breath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her desk.,1223
4249,Life was certainly very interesting.,1223
4250,In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend.,1224
4251,"Miss Stacy was a bright, sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally.",1224
4252,Anne expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring Matthew and the critical Marilla glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims.,1224
4253,"“I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart, Marilla.",1225
4254,She is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice.,1225
4255,When she pronounces my name I feel _instinctively_ that she’s spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon.,1225
4256,"I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite ‘Mary, Queen of Scots.’ I just put my whole soul into it.",1225
4257,"Ruby Gillis told me coming home that the way I said the line, ‘Now for my father’s arm,’ she said, ‘my woman’s heart farewell,’ just made her blood run cold.”",1225
4258,"“Well now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the barn,” suggested Matthew.",1226
4259,"“Of course I will,” said Anne meditatively, “but I won’t be able to do it so well, I know.",1227
4260,It won’t be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words.,1227
4261,I know I won’t be able to make your blood run cold.”,1227
4262,“Mrs.,1228
4263,"Lynde says it made _her_ blood run cold to see the boys climbing to the very tops of those big trees on Bell’s hill after crows’ nests last Friday,” said Marilla.",1228
4264,“I wonder at Miss Stacy for encouraging it.”,1228
4265,"“But we wanted a crow’s nest for nature study,” explained Anne.",1229
4266,“That was on our field afternoon.,1229
4267,"Field afternoons are splendid, Marilla.",1229
4268,And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully.,1229
4269,We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones.”,1229
4270,“It’s very vain of you to say so then.,1230
4271,You’d better let your teacher say it.”,1230
4272,"“But she _did_ say it, Marilla.",1231
4273,And indeed I’m not vain about it.,1231
4274,"How can I be, when I’m such a dunce at geometry?",1231
4275,"Although I’m really beginning to see through it a little, too.",1231
4276,Miss Stacy makes it so clear.,1231
4277,"Still, I’ll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection.",1231
4278,But I love writing compositions.,1231
4279,Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own subjects; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person.,1231
4280,It’s hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived.,1231
4281,Mustn’t it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you’re dead?,1231
4282,"Oh, I would dearly love to be remarkable.",1231
4283,I think when I grow up I’ll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy.,1231
4284,"That is, if I don’t go out as a foreign missionary.",1231
4285,"That would be very romantic, but one would have to be very good to be a missionary, and that would be a stumbling block.",1231
4286,"We have physical culture exercises every day, too.",1231
4287,They make you graceful and promote digestion.”,1231
4288,"“Promote fiddlesticks!” said Marilla, who honestly thought it was all nonsense.",1232
4289,But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which Miss Stacy brought forward in November.,1233
4290,"This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night, for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag.",1233
4291,"The pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan, the preparations for a program were begun at once.",1233
4292,"And of all the excited performers-elect none was so excited as Anne Shirley, who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul, hampered as she was by Marilla’s disapproval.",1233
4293,Marilla thought it all rank foolishness.,1233
4294,"“It’s just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons,” she grumbled.",1234
4295,“I don’t approve of children’s getting up concerts and racing about to practices.,1234
4296,It makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding.”,1234
4297,"“But think of the worthy object,” pleaded Anne.",1235
4298,"“A flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism, Marilla.”",1235
4299,“Fudge!,1236
4300,There’s precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you.,1236
4301,All you want is a good time.”,1236
4302,"“Well, when you can combine patriotism and fun, isn’t it all right?",1237
4303,Of course it’s real nice to be getting up a concert.,1237
4304,We’re going to have six choruses and Diana is to sing a solo.,1237
4305,I’m in two dialogues--‘The Society for the Suppression of Gossip’ and ‘The Fairy Queen.’ The boys are going to have a dialogue too.,1237
4306,"And I’m to have two recitations, Marilla.",1237
4307,"I just tremble when I think of it, but it’s a nice thrilly kind of tremble.",1237
4308,"And we’re to have a tableau at the last--‘Faith, Hope and Charity.’ Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair.",1237
4309,"I’m to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes uplifted.",1237
4310,I’m going to practice my recitations in the garret.,1237
4311,Don’t be alarmed if you hear me groaning.,1237
4312,"I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them, and it’s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.",1237
4313,Josie Pye is sulky because she didn’t get the part she wanted in the dialogue.,1237
4314,She wanted to be the fairy queen.,1237
4315,"That would have been ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie?",1237
4316,Fairy queens must be slender.,1237
4317,Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor.,1237
4318,"Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says.",1237
4319,I’m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I haven’t any of my own.,1237
4320,"It’s necessary for fairies to have slippers, you know.",1237
4321,"You couldn’t imagine a fairy wearing boots, could you?",1237
4322,Especially with copper toes?,1237
4323,We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them.,1237
4324,"And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the organ.",1237
4325,"Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am, but don’t you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?”",1237
4326,“All I hope is that you’ll behave yourself.,1238
4327,I’ll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and you’ll be able to settle down.,1238
4328,You are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus.,1238
4329,"As for your tongue, it’s a marvel it’s not clean worn out.”",1238
4330,"Anne sighed and betook herself to the back yard, over which a young new moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green western sky, and where Matthew was splitting wood.",1239
4331,"Anne perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him, sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least.",1239
4332,"“Well now, I reckon it’s going to be a pretty good concert.",1240
4333,"And I expect you’ll do your part fine,” he said, smiling down into her eager, vivacious little face.",1240
4334,Anne smiled back at him.,1240
4335,Those two were the best of friends and Matthew thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to do with bringing her up.,1240
4336,That was Marilla’s exclusive duty; if it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty.,1240
4337,"As it was, he was free to, “spoil Anne”--Marilla’s phrasing--as much as he liked.",1240
4338,But it was not such a bad arrangement after all; a little “appreciation” sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious “bringing up” in the world.,1240
4339, CHAPTER XXV.,1242
4340,Matthew Insists on Puffed Sleeves,1242
4341, MATTHEW was having a bad ten minutes of it.,1243
4342,"He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of “The Fairy Queen” in the sitting room.",1243
4343,"Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering gaily.",1243
4344,"They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert.",1243
4345,"Anne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different from her mates.",1243
4346,And what worried Matthew was that the difference impressed him as being something that should not exist.,1243
4347,"Anne had a brighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features than the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note of these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any of these respects.",1243
4348,Then in what did it consist?,1243
4349,"Matthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm in arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself to her books.",1244
4350,"He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while Anne never did.",1244
4351,"This, Matthew felt, would be no great help.",1244
4352,"He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much to Marilla’s disgust.",1245
4353,After two hours of smoking and hard reflection Matthew arrived at a solution of his problem.,1245
4354,Anne was not dressed like the other girls!,1245
4355,The more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that Anne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she had come to Green Gables.,1246
4356,"Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses, all made after the same unvarying pattern.",1246
4357,If Matthew knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was quite sure that Anne’s sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore.,1246
4358,He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned.,1246
4359,"Of course, it must be all right.",1247
4360,Marilla knew best and Marilla was bringing her up.,1247
4361,"Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served thereby.",1247
4362,But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress--something like Diana Barry always wore.,1247
4363,Matthew decided that he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar.,1247
4364,Christmas was only a fortnight off.,1247
4365,A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present.,1247
4366,"Matthew, with a sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla opened all the doors and aired the house.",1247
4367,"The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it.",1248
4368,"It would be, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal.",1248
4369,There were some things Matthew could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl’s dress.,1248
4370,After much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson’s store instead of William Blair’s.,1249
4371,"To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to William Blair’s; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative.",1249
4372,But William Blair’s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew held them in absolute dread.,1249
4373,"He could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter as this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter.",1249
4374,"So he would go to Lawson’s, where Samuel or his son would wait on him.",1249
4375,Alas!,1250
4376,"Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his business, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife’s and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile.",1250
4377,She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.,1250
4378,Matthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.,1250
4379,"“What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?” Miss Lucilla Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both hands.",1251
4380,"“Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?” stammered Matthew.",1252
4381,"Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.",1253
4382,"“I believe we have one or two left over,” she said, “but they’re upstairs in the lumber room.",1254
4383,I’ll go and see.” During her absence Matthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.,1254
4384,"When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired: “Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?” Matthew took his courage in both hands and replied: “Well now, since you suggest it, I might as well--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.”",1255
4385,Miss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd.,1256
4386,She now concluded that he was entirely crazy.,1256
4387,"“We only keep hayseed in the spring,” she explained loftily.",1257
4388,“We’ve none on hand just now.”,1257
4389,"“Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,” stammered unhappy Matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door.",1258
4390,At the threshold he recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.,1258
4391,While Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a final desperate attempt.,1258
4392,“Well now--if it isn’t too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I’d like to look at--at--some sugar.”,1259
4393,“White or brown?” queried Miss Harris patiently.,1260
4394,"“Oh--well now--brown,” said Matthew feebly.",1261
4395,"“There’s a barrel of it over there,” said Miss Harris, shaking her bangles at it.",1262
4396,“It’s the only kind we have.”,1262
4397,"“I’ll--I’ll take twenty pounds of it,” said Matthew, with beads of perspiration standing on his forehead.",1263
4398,Matthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again.,1264
4399,"It had been a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for committing the heresy of going to a strange store.",1264
4400,"When he reached home he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to Marilla.",1264
4401,“Brown sugar!” exclaimed Marilla.,1265
4402,“Whatever possessed you to get so much?,1265
4403,You know I never use it except for the hired man’s porridge or black fruit cake.,1265
4404,Jerry’s gone and I’ve made my cake long ago.,1265
4405,"It’s not good sugar, either--it’s coarse and dark--William Blair doesn’t usually keep sugar like that.”",1265
4406,"“I--I thought it might come in handy sometime,” said Matthew, making good his escape.",1266
4407,When Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was required to cope with the situation.,1267
4408,Marilla was out of the question.,1267
4409,Matthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.,1267
4410,Remained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew have dared to ask advice.,1267
4411,"To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man’s hands.",1267
4412,“Pick out a dress for you to give Anne?,1268
4413,To be sure I will.,1268
4414,I’m going to Carmody tomorrow and I’ll attend to it.,1268
4415,Have you something particular in mind?,1268
4416,No?,1268
4417,"Well, I’ll just go by my own judgment then.",1268
4418,"I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in that’s real pretty.",1268
4419,"Perhaps you’d like me to make it up for her, too, seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise?",1268
4420,"Well, I’ll do it.",1268
4421,"No, it isn’t a mite of trouble.",1268
4422,I like sewing.,1268
4423,"I’ll make it to fit my niece, Jenny Gillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.”",1268
4424,"“Well now, I’m much obliged,” said Matthew, “and--and--I dunno--but I’d like--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be.",1269
4425,If it wouldn’t be asking too much I--I’d like them made in the new way.”,1269
4426,“Puffs?,1270
4427,Of course.,1270
4428,"You needn’t worry a speck more about it, Matthew.",1270
4429,"I’ll make it up in the very latest fashion,” said Mrs. Lynde.",1270
4430,To herself she added when Matthew had gone:,1270
4431,“It’ll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once.,1271
4432,"The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous, that’s what, and I’ve ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times.",1271
4433,"I’ve held my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn’t want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she’s an old maid.",1271
4434,But that’s always the way.,1271
4435,Folks that has brought up children know that there’s no hard and fast method in the world that’ll suit every child.,1271
4436,"But them as never have think it’s all as plain and easy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and the sum ‘ll work out correct.",1271
4437,But flesh and blood don’t come under the head of arithmetic and that’s where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake.,1271
4438,I suppose she’s trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does; but it’s more likely to cultivate envy and discontent.,1271
4439,I’m sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls’.,1271
4440,But to think of Matthew taking notice of it!,1271
4441,That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years.”,1271
4442,"Marilla knew all the following fortnight that Matthew had something on his mind, but what it was she could not guess, until Christmas Eve, when Mrs. Lynde brought up the new dress.",1272
4443,"Marilla behaved pretty well on the whole, although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde’s diplomatic explanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne would find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.",1272
4444,"“So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?” she said a little stiffly but tolerantly.",1273
4445,“I knew he was up to some foolishness.,1273
4446,"Well, I must say I don’t think Anne needed any more dresses.",1273
4447,"I made her three good, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer extravagance.",1273
4448,"There’s enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist, I declare there is.",1273
4449,"You’ll just pamper Anne’s vanity, Matthew, and she’s as vain as a peacock now.",1273
4450,"Well, I hope she’ll be satisfied at last, for I know she’s been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in, although she never said a word after the first.",1273
4451,The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they’re as big as balloons now.,1273
4452,Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways.”,1273
4453,Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world.,1274
4454,It had been a very mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea.,1274
4455,Anne peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes.,1274
4456,The firs in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches and wild cherry-trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious.,1274
4457,Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed through Green Gables.,1274
4458,"“Merry Christmas, Marilla!",1275
4459,"Merry Christmas, Matthew!",1275
4460,Isn’t it a lovely Christmas?,1275
4461,I’m so glad it’s white.,1275
4462,"Any other kind of Christmas doesn’t seem real, does it?",1275
4463,I don’t like green Christmases.,1275
4464,They’re not green--they’re just nasty faded browns and grays.,1275
4465,What makes people call them green?,1275
4466,"Why--why--Matthew, is that for me?",1275
4467,"Oh, Matthew!”",1275
4468,"Matthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.",1276
4469,Anne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence.,1277
4470,"Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.",1277
4471,But the sleeves--they were the crowning glory!,1277
4472,"Long elbow cuffs, and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown-silk ribbon.",1277
4473,"“That’s a Christmas present for you, Anne,” said Matthew shyly.",1278
4474,"“Why--why--Anne, don’t you like it?",1278
4475,Well now--well now.”,1278
4476,For Anne’s eyes had suddenly filled with tears.,1279
4477,“Like it!,1280
4478,"Oh, Matthew!” Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped her hands.",1280
4479,"“Matthew, it’s perfectly exquisite.",1280
4480,"Oh, I can never thank you enough.",1280
4481,Look at those sleeves!,1280
4482,"Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy dream.”",1280
4483,"“Well, well, let us have breakfast,” interrupted Marilla.",1281
4484,"“I must say, Anne, I don’t think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it for you, see that you take good care of it.",1281
4485,There’s a hair ribbon Mrs. Lynde left for you.,1281
4486,"It’s brown, to match the dress.",1281
4487,"Come now, sit in.”",1281
4488,"“I don’t see how I’m going to eat breakfast,” said Anne rapturously.",1282
4489,“Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment.,1282
4490,I’d rather feast my eyes on that dress.,1282
4491,I’m so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable.,1282
4492,It did seem to me that I’d never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them.,1282
4493,"I’d never have felt quite satisfied, you see.",1282
4494,It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too.,1282
4495,I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed.,1282
4496,It’s at times like this I’m sorry I’m not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will be in future.,1282
4497,But somehow it’s hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come.,1282
4498,"Still, I really will make an extra effort after this.”",1282
4499,"When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster.",1283
4500,Anne flew down the slope to meet her.,1283
4501,"“Merry Christmas, Diana!",1284
4502,"And oh, it’s a wonderful Christmas.",1284
4503,I’ve something splendid to show you.,1284
4504,"Matthew has given me the loveliest dress, with _such_ sleeves.",1284
4505,I couldn’t even imagine any nicer.”,1284
4506,"“I’ve got something more for you,” said Diana breathlessly.",1285
4507,“Here--this box.,1285
4508,Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it--and this is for you.,1285
4509,"I’d have brought it over last night, but it didn’t come until after dark, and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now.”",1285
4510,Anne opened the box and peeped in.,1286
4511,"First a card with “For the Anne-girl and Merry Christmas,” written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles.",1286
4512,"“Oh,” said Anne, “Diana, this is too much.",1287
4513,I must be dreaming.”,1287
4514,"“I call it providential,” said Diana.",1288
4515,"“You won’t have to borrow Ruby’s slippers now, and that’s a blessing, for they’re two sizes too big for you, and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling.",1288
4516,Josie Pye would be delighted.,1288
4517,"Mind you, Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the practice night before last.",1288
4518,Did you ever hear anything equal to that?”,1288
4519,"All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.",1289
4520,The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success.,1290
4521,"The little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but Anne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in the shape of Josie Pye, dared not deny.",1290
4522,"“Oh, hasn’t it been a brilliant evening?” sighed Anne, when it was all over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry sky.",1291
4523,"“Everything went off very well,” said Diana practically.",1292
4524,“I guess we must have made as much as ten dollars.,1292
4525,"Mind you, Mr. Allan is going to send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers.”",1292
4526,"“Oh, Diana, will we really see our names in print?",1293
4527,It makes me thrill to think of it.,1293
4528,"Your solo was perfectly elegant, Diana.",1293
4529,I felt prouder than you did when it was encored.,1293
4530,"I just said to myself, ‘It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored.’”",1293
4531,"“Well, your recitations just brought down the house, Anne.",1294
4532,That sad one was simply splendid.”,1294
4533,"“Oh, I was so nervous, Diana.",1295
4534,When Mr. Allan called out my name I really cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform.,1295
4535,"I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me, and for one dreadful moment I was sure I couldn’t begin at all.",1295
4536,Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage.,1295
4537,"I knew that I must live up to those sleeves, Diana.",1295
4538,"So I started in, and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away.",1295
4539,I just felt like a parrot.,1295
4540,"It’s providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret, or I’d never have been able to get through.",1295
4541,Did I groan all right?”,1295
4542,"“Yes, indeed, you groaned lovely,” assured Diana.",1296
4543,“I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down.,1297
4544,It was splendid to think I had touched somebody’s heart.,1297
4545,"It’s so romantic to take part in a concert, isn’t it?",1297
4546,"Oh, it’s been a very memorable occasion indeed.”",1297
4547,“Wasn’t the boys’ dialogue fine?” said Diana.,1298
4548,“Gilbert Blythe was just splendid.,1298
4549,"Anne, I do think it’s awful mean the way you treat Gil.",1298
4550,Wait till I tell you.,1298
4551,When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair.,1298
4552,I saw Gil pick it up and put it in his breast pocket.,1298
4553,There now.,1298
4554,You’re so romantic that I’m sure you ought to be pleased at that.”,1298
4555,"“It’s nothing to me what that person does,” said Anne loftily.",1299
4556,"“I simply never waste a thought on him, Diana.”",1299
4557,"That night Marilla and Matthew, who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenty years, sat for a while by the kitchen fire after Anne had gone to bed.",1300
4558,"“Well now, I guess our Anne did as well as any of them,” said Matthew proudly.",1301
4559,"“Yes, she did,” admitted Marilla.",1302
4560,"“She’s a bright child, Matthew.",1302
4561,And she looked real nice too.,1302
4562,"I’ve been kind of opposed to this concert scheme, but I suppose there’s no real harm in it after all.",1302
4563,"Anyhow, I was proud of Anne tonight, although I’m not going to tell her so.”",1302
4564,"“Well now, I was proud of her and I did tell her so ‘fore she went upstairs,” said Matthew.",1303
4565,"“We must see what we can do for her some of these days, Marilla.",1303
4566,I guess she’ll need something more than Avonlea school by and by.”,1303
4567,"“There’s time enough to think of that,” said Marilla.",1304
4568,“She’s only thirteen in March.,1304
4569,Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl.,1304
4570,"Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long, and it makes Anne look so tall.",1304
4571,She’s quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to Queen’s after a spell.,1304
4572,But nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet.”,1304
4573,"“Well now, it’ll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on,” said Matthew.",1305
4574,“Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over.”,1305
4575, CHAPTER XXVI.,1307
4576,The Story Club Is Formed,1307
4577, JUNIOR Avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again.,1308
4578,"To Anne in particular things seemed fearfully flat, stale, and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks.",1308
4579,Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert?,1308
4580,"At first, as she told Diana, she did not really think she could.",1308
4581,"“I’m positively certain, Diana, that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days,” she said mournfully, as if referring to a period of at least fifty years back.",1309
4582,"“Perhaps after a while I’ll get used to it, but I’m afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life.",1309
4583,I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them.,1309
4584,Marilla is such a sensible woman.,1309
4585,"It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but still, I don’t believe I’d really want to be a sensible person, because they are so unromantic.",1309
4586,"Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one, but you can never tell.",1309
4587,I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible yet.,1309
4588,But perhaps that is only because I’m tired.,1309
4589,I simply couldn’t sleep last night for ever so long.,1309
4590,I just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again.,1309
4591,That’s one splendid thing about such affairs--it’s so lovely to look back to them.”,1309
4592,"Eventually, however, Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests.",1310
4593,"To be sure, the concert left traces.",1310
4594,"Ruby Gillis and Emma White, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising friendship of three years was broken up.",1310
4595,"Josie Pye and Julia Bell did not “speak” for three months, because Josie Pye had told Bessie Wright that Julia Bell’s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head, and Bessie told Julia.",1310
4596,"None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells, because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly.",1310
4597,"Finally, Charlie Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, because Moody Spurgeon had said that Anne Shirley put on airs about her recitations, and Moody Spurgeon was “licked”; consequently Moody Spurgeon’s sister, Ella May, would not “speak” to Anne Shirley all the rest of the winter.",1310
4598,"With the exception of these trifling frictions, work in Miss Stacy’s little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.",1310
4599,The winter weeks slipped by.,1311
4600,"It was an unusually mild winter, with so little snow that Anne and Diana could go to school nearly every day by way of the Birch Path.",1311
4601,"On Anne’s birthday they were tripping lightly down it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss Stacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on “A Winter’s Walk in the Woods,” and it behooved them to be observant.",1311
4602,"“Just think, Diana, I’m thirteen years old today,” remarked Anne in an awed voice.",1312
4603,“I can scarcely realize that I’m in my teens.,1312
4604,When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different.,1312
4605,"You’ve been thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn’t seem such a novelty to you as it does to me.",1312
4606,It makes life seem so much more interesting.,1312
4607,In two more years I’ll be really grown up.,1312
4608,It’s a great comfort to think that I’ll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.”,1312
4609,"“Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she’s fifteen,”  said Diana.",1313
4610,"“Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,” said Anne disdainfully.",1314
4611,“She’s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad.,1314
4612,But I’m afraid that is an uncharitable speech.,1314
4613,"Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don’t they?",1314
4614,"I simply can’t talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech, so I never mention her at all.",1314
4615,You may have noticed that.,1314
4616,"I’m trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she’s perfect.",1314
4617,Mr. Allan thinks so too.,1314
4618,Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she doesn’t really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being.,1314
4619,"But then, Diana, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else.",1314
4620,I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon.,1314
4621,There are just a few things it’s proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them.,1314
4622,My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties.,1314
4623,I’m striving very hard to overcome it and now that I’m really thirteen perhaps I’ll get on better.”,1314
4624,"“In four more years we’ll be able to put our hair up,” said Diana.",1315
4625,"“Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think that’s ridiculous.",1315

4627,"“If I had Alice Bell’s crooked nose,” said Anne decidedly, “I wouldn’t--but there!",1316
4628,I won’t say what I was going to because it was extremely uncharitable.,1316
4629,"Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and that’s vanity.",1316
4630,I’m afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago.,1316
4631,It really is a great comfort to me.,1316
4632,"Oh, Diana, look, there’s a rabbit.",1316
4633,That’s something to remember for our woods composition.,1316
4634,I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer.,1316

4636,"“I won’t mind writing that composition when its time comes,” sighed Diana.",1317
4637,"“I can manage to write about the woods, but the one we’re to hand in Monday is terrible.",1317
4638,The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a story out of our own heads!”,1317
4639,"“Why, it’s as easy as wink,” said Anne.",1318
4640,"“It’s easy for you because you have an imagination,” retorted Diana, “but what would you do if you had been born without one?",1319
4641,I suppose you have your composition all done?”,1319
4642,"Anne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing miserably.",1320
4643,“I wrote it last Monday evening.,1321
4644,It’s called ‘The Jealous Rival; or In Death Not Divided.’ I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense.,1321
4645,Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine.,1321
4646,That is the kind of critic I like.,1321
4647,"It’s a sad, sweet story.",1321
4648,I just cried like a child while I was writing it.,1321
4649,It’s about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other.,1321
4650,Cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes.,1321
4651,Geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.”,1321
4652,"“I never saw anybody with purple eyes,” said Diana dubiously.",1322
4653,“Neither did I. I just imagined them.,1323
4654,I wanted something out of the common.,1323
4655,Geraldine had an alabaster brow too.,1323
4656,I’ve found out what an alabaster brow is.,1323
4657,That is one of the advantages of being thirteen.,1323
4658,You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve.”,1323
4659,"“Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?” asked Diana, who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate.",1324
4660,“They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen.,1325
4661,Then Bertram DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair Geraldine.,1325
4662,"He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up.",1325
4663,I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by.,1325
4664,"I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she’d likely be an authority on the subject, having so many sisters married.",1325
4665,Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan.,1325
4666,"She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, ‘What do you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?’ And Susan said, ‘Yes--no--I don’t know--let me see’--and there they were, engaged as quick as that.",1325
4667,"But I didn’t think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.",1325
4668,"I made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees, although Ruby Gillis says it isn’t done nowadays.",1325
4669,Geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long.,1325
4670,I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech.,1325
4671,I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece.,1325
4672,"Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was immensely wealthy.",1325
4673,"But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their path.",1325
4674,"Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious, especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring.",1325
4675,All her affection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry Bertram.,1325
4676,But she pretended to be Geraldine’s friend the same as ever.,1325
4677,"One evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed Geraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, ‘Ha, ha, ha.’ But Bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, ‘I will save thee, my peerless Geraldine.’ But alas, he had forgotten he couldn’t swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other’s arms.",1325
4678,Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards.,1325
4679,"They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana.",1325
4680,It’s so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding.,1325
4681,"As for Cordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum.",1325
4682,I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.”,1325
4683,"“How perfectly lovely!” sighed Diana, who belonged to Matthew’s school of critics.",1326
4684,"“I don’t see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head, Anne.",1326
4685,I wish my imagination was as good as yours.”,1326
4686,"“It would be if you’d only cultivate it,” said Anne cheeringly.",1327
4687,"“I’ve just thought of a plan, Diana.",1327
4688,Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice.,1327
4689,I’ll help you along until you can do them by yourself.,1327
4690,"You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know.",1327
4691,Miss Stacy says so.,1327
4692,Only we must take the right way.,1327
4693,"I told her about the Haunted Wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that.”",1327
4694,This was how the story club came into existence.,1328
4695,"It was limited to Diana and Anne at first, but soon it was extended to include Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed cultivating.",1328
4696,No boys were allowed in it--although Ruby Gillis opined that their admission would make it more exciting--and each member had to produce one story a week.,1328
4697,"“It’s extremely interesting,” Anne told Marilla.",1329
4698,“Each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over.,1329
4699,We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants.,1329
4700,We each write under a nom-de-plume.,1329
4701,Mine is Rosamond Montmorency.,1329
4702,All the girls do pretty well.,1329
4703,Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental.,1329
4704,She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little.,1329
4705,Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud.,1329
4706,Jane’s stories are extremely sensible.,1329
4707,Then Diana puts too many murders into hers.,1329
4708,She says most of the time she doesn’t know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them.,1329
4709,"I mostly always have to tell them what to write about, but that isn’t hard for I’ve millions of ideas.”",1329
4710,"“I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet,” scoffed Marilla.",1330
4711,“You’ll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons.,1330
4712,Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse.”,1330
4713,"“But we’re so careful to put a moral into them all, Marilla,” explained Anne.",1331
4714,“I insist upon that.,1331
4715,All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished.,1331
4716,I’m sure that must have a wholesome effect.,1331
4717,The moral is the great thing.,1331
4718,Mr. Allan says so.,1331
4719,I read one of my stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent.,1331
4720,Only they laughed in the wrong places.,1331
4721,I like it better when people cry.,1331
4722,Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts.,1331
4723,Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt Josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories.,1331
4724,So we copied out four of our very best and sent them.,1331
4725,Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life.,1331
4726,That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died.,1331
4727,But I’m glad Miss Barry liked them.,1331
4728,It shows our club is doing some good in the world.,1331
4729,Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our object in everything.,1331
4730,I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when I’m having fun.,1331
4731,I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan when I grow up.,1331
4732,"Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?”",1331
4733,“I shouldn’t say there was a great deal” was Marilla’s encouraging answer.,1332
4734,"“I’m sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little girl as you are.”",1332
4735,"“No; but she wasn’t always so good as she is now either,” said Anne seriously.",1333
4736,"“She told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes.",1333
4737,I felt so encouraged when I heard that.,1333
4738,"Is it very wicked of me, Marilla, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous?",1333
4739,Mrs. Lynde says it is.,1333
4740,"Mrs. Lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how small they were.",1333
4741,Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt’s pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again.,1333
4742,"Now, I wouldn’t have felt that way.",1333
4743,"I’d have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it, and I’d have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it.",1333
4744,"That’s how I’d feel, Marilla.”",1333
4745,"“The way I feel at present, Anne,” said Marilla, “is that it’s high time you had those dishes washed.",1334
4746,You’ve taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering.,1334
4747,Learn to work first and talk afterwards.”,1334
4748, CHAPTER XXVII.,1336
4749,Vanity and Vexation of Spirit,1336
4750," MARILLA, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting, realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest.",1337
4751,Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings.,1337
4752,"She probably imagined that she was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod.",1337
4753,"The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla’s sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.",1337
4754,"Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, peering through its network of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory.",1338
4755,"Marilla, as she picked her steps along the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea, instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before Anne had come to Green Gables.",1338
4756,"Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated.",1339
4757,"She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five o’clock, but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and prepare the meal herself against Matthew’s return from plowing.",1339
4758,"“I’ll settle Miss Anne when she comes home,” said Marilla grimly, as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary.",1340
4759,Matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner.,1340
4760,"“She’s gadding off somewhere with Diana, writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never thinking once about the time or her duties.",1340
4761,She’s just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing.,1340
4762,I don’t care if Mrs. Allan does say she’s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew.,1340
4763,"She may be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there’s never any knowing what shape it’ll break out in next.",1340
4764,Just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another.,1340
4765,But there!,1340
4766,Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today.,1340
4767,"I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne, for if she hadn’t I know I’d have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody.",1340
4768,"Anne’s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it from me to deny it.",1340
4769,"But I’m bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde, who’d pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea.",1340
4770,"Just the same, Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things.",1340
4771,"I must say, with all her faults, I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I’m real sorry to find her so now.”",1340
4772,"“Well now, I dunno,” said Matthew, who, being patient and wise and, above all, hungry, had deemed it best to let Marilla talk her wrath out unhindered, having learned by experience that she got through with whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument.",1341
4773,"“Perhaps you’re judging her too hasty, Marilla.",1341
4774,Don’t call her untrustworthy until you’re sure she has disobeyed you.,1341
4775,Mebbe it can all be explained--Anne’s a great hand at explaining.”,1341
4776,"“She’s not here when I told her to stay,” retorted Marilla.",1342
4777,“I reckon she’ll find it hard to explain _that_ to my satisfaction.,1342
4778,"Of course I knew you’d take her part, Matthew.",1342
4779,"But I’m bringing her up, not you.”",1342
4780,"It was dark when supper was ready, and still no sign of Anne, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover’s Lane, breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties.",1343
4781,Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly.,1343
4782,"Then, wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar, she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on Anne’s table.",1343
4783,"Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself lying on the bed, face downward among the pillows.",1343
4784,"“Mercy on us,” said astonished Marilla, “have you been asleep, Anne?”",1344
4785,"“No,” was the muffled reply.",1345
4786,"“Are you sick then?” demanded Marilla anxiously, going over to the bed.",1346
4787,Anne cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes.,1347
4788,“No.,1348
4789,"But please, Marilla, go away and don’t look at me.",1348
4790,I’m in the depths of despair and I don’t care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more.,1348
4791,Little things like that are of no importance now because I don’t suppose I’ll ever be able to go anywhere again.,1348
4792,My career is closed.,1348
4793,"Please, Marilla, go away and don’t look at me.”",1348
4794,“Did anyone ever hear the like?” the mystified Marilla wanted to know.,1349
4795,"“Anne Shirley, whatever is the matter with you?",1349
4796,What have you done?,1349
4797,Get right up this minute and tell me.,1349
4798,"This minute, I say.",1349
4799,"There now, what is it?”",1349
4800,Anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience.,1350
4801,"“Look at my hair, Marilla,” she whispered.",1351
4802,"Accordingly, Marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at Anne’s hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back.",1352
4803,It certainly had a very strange appearance.,1352
4804,"“Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair?",1353
4805,"Why, it’s _green!_”",1353
4806,"Green it might be called, if it were any earthly color--a queer, dull, bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect.",1354
4807,Never in all her life had Marilla seen anything so grotesque as Anne’s hair at that moment.,1354
4808,"“Yes, it’s green,” moaned Anne.",1355
4809,“I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair.,1355
4810,But now I know it’s ten times worse to have green hair.,1355
4811,"Oh, Marilla, you little know how utterly wretched I am.”",1355
4812,"“I little know how you got into this fix, but I mean to find out,” said Marilla.",1356
4813,“Come right down to the kitchen--it’s too cold up here--and tell me just what you’ve done.,1356
4814,I’ve been expecting something queer for some time.,1356
4815,"You haven’t got into any scrape for over two months, and I was sure another one was due.",1356
4816,"Now, then, what did you do to your hair?”",1356
4817,“I dyed it.”,1357
4818,“Dyed it!,1358
4819,Dyed your hair!,1358
4820,"Anne Shirley, didn’t you know it was a wicked thing to do?”",1358
4821,"“Yes, I knew it was a little wicked,” admitted Anne.",1359
4822,“But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair.,1359
4823,"I counted the cost, Marilla.",1359
4824,"Besides, I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it.”",1359
4825,"“Well,” said Marilla sarcastically, “if I’d decided it was worth while to dye my hair I’d have dyed it a decent color at least.",1360
4826,I wouldn’t have dyed it green.”,1360
4827,"“But I didn’t mean to dye it green, Marilla,” protested Anne dejectedly.",1361
4828,“If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose.,1361
4829,He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it would.,1361
4830,"How could I doubt his word, Marilla?",1361
4831,I know what it feels like to have your word doubted.,1361
4832,And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they’re not.,1361
4833,I have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody.,1361
4834,But I hadn’t then and I believed every word he said _implicitly_.”,1361
4835,“Who said?,1362
4836,Who are you talking about?”,1362
4837,“The peddler that was here this afternoon.,1363
4838,I bought the dye from him.”,1363
4839,"“Anne Shirley, how often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house!",1364
4840,I don’t believe in encouraging them to come around at all.”,1364
4841,"“Oh, I didn’t let him in the house.",1365
4842,"I remembered what you told me, and I went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.",1365
4843,"Besides, he wasn’t an Italian--he was a German Jew.",1365
4844,He had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany.,1365
4845,He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart.,1365
4846,I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object.,1365
4847,Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye.,1365
4848,The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn’t wash off.,1365
4849,In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible.,1365
4850,But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money.,1365
4851,"I think the peddler had a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he’d sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away.",1365
4852,"So I bought it, and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said.",1365
4853,"I used up the whole bottle, and oh, Marilla, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked, I can tell you.",1365
4854,And I’ve been repenting ever since.”,1365
4855,"“Well, I hope you’ll repent to good purpose,” said Marilla severely, “and that you’ve got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you, Anne.",1366
4856,Goodness knows what’s to be done.,1366
4857,I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good.”,1366
4858,"Accordingly, Anne washed her hair, scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water, but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red.",1367
4859,"The peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he declared that the dye wouldn’t wash off, however his veracity might be impeached in other respects.",1367
4860,"“Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?” questioned Anne in tears.",1368
4861,“I can never live this down.,1368
4862,People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes--the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with Mrs. Lynde.,1368
4863,But they’ll never forget this.,1368
4864,They will think I am not respectable.,1368
4865,"Oh, Marilla, ‘what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.’ That is poetry, but it is true.",1368
4866,"And oh, how Josie Pye will laugh!",1368
4867,"Marilla, I _cannot_ face Josie Pye.",1368
4868,I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island.”,1368
4869,Anne’s unhappiness continued for a week.,1369
4870,During that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day.,1369
4871,"Diana alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may be stated here and now that she kept her word.",1369
4872,At the end of the week Marilla said decidedly:,1369
4873,"“It’s no use, Anne.",1370
4874,That is fast dye if ever there was any.,1370
4875,Your hair must be cut off; there is no other way.,1370
4876,You can’t go out with it looking like that.”,1370
4877,"Anne’s lips quivered, but she realized the bitter truth of Marilla’s remarks.",1371
4878,With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors.,1371
4879,"“Please cut it off at once, Marilla, and have it over.",1372
4880,"Oh, I feel that my heart is broken.",1372
4881,This is such an unromantic affliction.,1372
4882,"The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed, and I’m sure I wouldn’t mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much.",1372
4883,"But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you’ve dyed it a dreadful color, is there?",1372
4884,"I’m going to weep all the time you’re cutting it off, if it won’t interfere.",1372
4885,It seems such a tragic thing.”,1372
4886,"Anne wept then, but later on, when she went upstairs and looked in the glass, she was calm with despair.",1373
4887,Marilla had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible.,1373
4888,"The result was not becoming, to state the case as mildly as may be.",1373
4889,Anne promptly turned her glass to the wall.,1373
4890,"“I’ll never, never look at myself again until my hair grows,” she exclaimed passionately.",1374
4891,Then she suddenly righted the glass.,1375
4892,"“Yes, I will, too.",1376
4893,I’d do penance for being wicked that way.,1376
4894,I’ll look at myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am.,1376
4895,"And I won’t try to imagine it away, either.",1376
4896,"I never thought I was vain about my hair, of all things, but now I know I was, in spite of its being red, because it was so long and thick and curly.",1376
4897,I expect something will happen to my nose next.”,1376
4898,"Anne’s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday, but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it, not even Josie Pye, who, however, did not fail to inform Anne that she looked like a perfect scarecrow.",1377
4899,"“I didn’t say anything when Josie said that to me,” Anne confided that evening to Marilla, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches, “because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently.",1378
4900,It’s hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back.,1378
4901,But I didn’t.,1378
4902,I just swept her one scornful look and then I forgave her.,1378
4903,"It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people, doesn’t it?",1378
4904,I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again.,1378
4905,Of course it’s better to be good.,1378
4906,"I know it is, but it’s sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it.",1378
4907,"I do really want to be good, Marilla, like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy, and grow up to be a credit to you.",1378
4908,Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side.,1378
4909,She says she thinks it will be very becoming.,1378
4910,I will call it a snood--that sounds so romantic.,1378
4911,"But am I talking too much, Marilla?",1378
4912,Does it hurt your head?”,1378
4913,“My head is better now.,1379
4914,"It was terrible bad this afternoon, though.",1379
4915,These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse.,1379
4916,I’ll have to see a doctor about them.,1379
4917,"As for your chatter, I don’t know that I mind it--I’ve got so used to it.”",1379
4918,Which was Marilla’s way of saying that she liked to hear it.,1380
4919, CHAPTER XXVIII.,1382
4920,An Unfortunate Lily Maid,1382
4921," OF course you must be Elaine, Anne,” said Diana.",1383
4922,“I could never have the courage to float down there.”,1383
4923,"“Nor I,” said Ruby Gillis, with a shiver.",1384
4924,“I don’t mind floating down when there’s two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up.,1384
4925,It’s fun then.,1384
4926,But to lie down and pretend I was dead--I just couldn’t.,1384
4927,I’d die really of fright.”,1384
4928,"“Of course it would be romantic,” conceded Jane Andrews, “but I know I couldn’t keep still.",1385
4929,I’d be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I wasn’t drifting too far out.,1385
4930,"And you know, Anne, that would spoil the effect.”",1385
4931,"“But it’s so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine,” mourned Anne.",1386
4932,“I’m not afraid to float down and I’d love to be Elaine.,1386
4933,But it’s ridiculous just the same.,1386
4934,"Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair--Elaine had ‘all her bright hair streaming down,’ you know.",1386
4935,And Elaine was the lily maid.,1386
4936,"Now, a red-haired person cannot be a lily maid.”",1386
4937,"“Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby’s,” said Diana earnestly, “and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it.”",1387
4938,"“Oh, do you really think so?” exclaimed Anne, flushing sensitively with delight.",1388
4939,“I’ve sometimes thought it was myself--but I never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it wasn’t.,1388
4940,"Do you think it could be called auburn now, Diana?”",1388
4941,"“Yes, and I think it is real pretty,” said Diana, looking admiringly at the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne’s head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow.",1389
4942,"They were standing on the bank of the pond, below Orchard Slope, where a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and duck hunters.",1390
4943,"Ruby and Jane were spending the midsummer afternoon with Diana, and Anne had come over to play with them.",1390
4944,Anne and Diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the pond.,1391
4945,"Idlewild was a thing of the past, Mr. Bell having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring.",1391
4946,"Anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the romance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and Diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond.",1391
4947,It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat-bottomed dory Mr. Barry kept for duck shooting.,1391
4948,It was Anne’s idea that they dramatize Elaine.,1392
4949,"They had studied Tennyson’s poem in school the preceding winter, the Superintendent of Education having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince Edward Island schools.",1392
4950,"They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them, but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and Guinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them, and Anne was devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot.",1392
4951,"Those days, she said, were so much more romantic than the present.",1392
4952,Anne’s plan was hailed with enthusiasm.,1393
4953,The girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond.,1393
4954,They had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing Elaine.,1393
4955,"“Well, I’ll be Elaine,” said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although she would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her limitations made impossible.",1394
4956,"“Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot.",1394
4957,But first you must be the brothers and the father.,1394
4958,We can’t have the old dumb servitor because there isn’t room for two in the flat when one is lying down.,1394
4959,We must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite.,1394
4960,"That old black shawl of your mother’s will be just the thing, Diana.”",1394
4961,"The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast.",1395
4962,"“Oh, she does look really dead,” whispered Ruby Gillis nervously, watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches.",1396
4963,"“It makes me feel frightened, girls.",1396
4964,Do you suppose it’s really right to act like this?,1396
4965,Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is abominably wicked.”,1396
4966,"“Ruby, you shouldn’t talk about Mrs. Lynde,” said Anne severely.",1397
4967,“It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was born.,1397
4968,"Jane, you arrange this.",1397
4969,It’s silly for Elaine to be talking when she’s dead.”,1397
4970,Jane rose to the occasion.,1398
4971,"Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute.",1398
4972,"A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne’s folded hands was all that could be desired.",1398
4973,"“Now, she’s all ready,” said Jane.",1399
4974,"“We must kiss her quiet brows and, Diana, you say, ‘Sister, farewell forever,’ and Ruby, you say, ‘Farewell, sweet sister,’ both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can.",1399
4975,"Anne, for goodness sake smile a little.",1399
4976,You know Elaine ‘lay as though she smiled.’ That’s better.,1399
4977,Now push the flat off.”,1399
4978,"The flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process.",1400
4979,"Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower headland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid.",1400
4980,"For a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full.",1401
4981,Then something happened not at all romantic.,1401
4982,The flat began to leak.,1401
4983,"In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine to scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring.",1401
4984,That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat.,1401
4985,"Anne did not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight.",1401
4986,At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland.,1401
4987,Where were the oars?,1401
4988,Left behind at the landing!,1401
4989,"Anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession.",1402
4990,There was one chance--just one.,1402
4991,"“I was horribly frightened,” she told Mrs. Allan the next day, “and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment.",1403
4992,"I prayed, Mrs. Allan, most earnestly, but I didn’t shut my eyes to pray, for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it.",1403
4993,You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them.,1403
4994,"It was proper to pray, but I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it.",1403
4995,"I just said, ‘Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile and I’ll do the rest,’ over and over again.",1403
4996,Under such circumstances you don’t think much about making a flowery prayer.,1403
4997,"But mine was answered, for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub.",1403
4998,"And there I was, Mrs. Allan, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down.",1403
4999,"It was a very unromantic position, but I didn’t think about that at the time.",1403
5000,You don’t think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave.,1403
5001,"I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight, for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land.”",1403
5002,The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream.,1404
5003,"Ruby, Jane, and Diana, already awaiting it on the lower headland, saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that Anne had gone down with it.",1404
5004,"For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of their voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge.",1404
5005,"Anne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks.",1404
5006,"Help would soon come, but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one.",1404
5007,"The minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid.",1405
5008,Why didn’t somebody come?,1405
5009,Where had the girls gone?,1405
5010,"Suppose they had fainted, one and all!",1405
5011,Suppose nobody ever came!,1405
5012,Suppose she grew so tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer!,1405
5013,"Anne looked at the wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered.",1405
5014,Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her.,1405
5015,"Then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the bridge in Harmon Andrews’s dory!",1406
5016,"Gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also scornful gray eyes.",1407
5017,“Anne Shirley!,1408
5018,How on earth did you get there?” he exclaimed.,1408
5019,Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand.,1409
5020,"There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe’s hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious, in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe.",1409
5021,It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!,1409
5022,"“What has happened, Anne?” asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.",1410
5023,"“We were playing Elaine,” explained Anne frigidly, without even looking at her rescuer, “and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I mean the flat.",1411
5024,The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile.,1411
5025,The girls went for help.,1411
5026,Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing?”,1411
5027,"Gilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance, sprang nimbly on shore.",1412
5028,"“I’m very much obliged to you,” she said haughtily as she turned away.",1413
5029,But Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her arm.,1413
5030,"“Anne,” he said hurriedly, “look here.",1414
5031,Can’t we be good friends?,1414
5032,I’m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time.,1414
5033,I didn’t mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke.,1414
5034,"Besides, it’s so long ago.",1414
5035,I think your hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do.,1414
5036,Let’s be friends.”,1414
5037,For a moment Anne hesitated.,1415
5038,"She had an odd, newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy, half-eager expression in Gilbert’s hazel eyes was something that was very good to see.",1415
5039,"Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat.",1415
5040,But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination.,1415
5041,That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday.,1415
5042,Gilbert had called her “carrots” and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school.,1415
5043,"Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly.",1415
5044,She hated Gilbert Blythe!,1415
5045,She would never forgive him!,1415
5046,"“No,” she said coldly, “I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert Blythe; and I don’t want to be!”",1416
5047,“All right!” Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks.,1417
5048,"“I’ll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley.",1417
5049,And I don’t care either!”,1417
5050,"He pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep, ferny little path under the maples.",1418
5051,"She held her head very high, but she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret.",1418
5052,She almost wished she had answered Gilbert differently.,1418
5053,"Of course, he had insulted her terribly, but still--!",1418
5054,"Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry.",1418
5055,"She was really quite unstrung, for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.",1418
5056,Halfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy.,1419
5057,"They had found nobody at Orchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away.",1419
5058,"Here Ruby Gillis had succumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she might, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the brook to Green Gables.",1419
5059,"There they had found nobody either, for Marilla had gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.",1419
5060,"“Oh, Anne,” gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former’s neck and weeping with relief and delight, “oh, Anne--we thought--you were--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you be--Elaine.",1420
5061,"And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?”",1420
5062,"“I climbed up on one of the piles,” explained Anne wearily, “and Gilbert Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews’s dory and brought me to land.”",1421
5063,"“Oh, Anne, how splendid of him!",1422
5064,"Why, it’s so romantic!” said Jane, finding breath enough for utterance at last.",1422
5065,“Of course you’ll speak to him after this.”,1422
5066,"“Of course I won’t,” flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old spirit.",1423
5067,"“And I don’t want ever to hear the word ‘romantic’ again, Jane Andrews.",1423
5068,"I’m awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls.",1423
5069,It is all my fault.,1423
5070,I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star.,1423
5071,Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape.,1423
5072,"We’ve gone and lost your father’s flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we’ll not be allowed to row on the pond any more.”",1423
5073,Anne’s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do.,1424
5074,Great was the consternation in the Barry and Cuthbert households when the events of the afternoon became known.,1424
5075,"“Will you ever have any sense, Anne?” groaned Marilla.",1425
5076,"“Oh, yes, I think I will, Marilla,” returned Anne optimistically.",1426
5077,"A good cry, indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable, had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness.",1426
5078,“I think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever.”,1426
5079,"“I don’t see how,” said Marilla.",1427
5080,"“Well,” explained Anne, “I’ve learned a new and valuable lesson today.",1428
5081,"Ever since I came to Green Gables I’ve been making mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming.",1428
5082,The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn’t belong to me.,1428
5083,The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me.,1428
5084,The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking.,1428
5085,Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity.,1428
5086,"I never think about my hair and nose now--at least, very seldom.",1428
5087,And today’s mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic.,1428
5088,I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea.,1428
5089,"It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now.",1428
5090,"I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla.”",1428
5091,"“I’m sure I hope so,” said Marilla skeptically.",1429
5092,"But Matthew, who had been sitting mutely in his corner, laid a hand on Anne’s shoulder when Marilla had gone out.",1430
5093,"“Don’t give up all your romance, Anne,” he whispered shyly, “a little of it is a good thing--not too much, of course--but keep a little of it, Anne, keep a little of it.”",1431
5094, CHAPTER XXIX.,1433
5095,An Epoch in Anne’s Life,1433
5096, ANNE was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover’s Lane.,1434
5097,It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light.,1434
5098,"Here and there the lane was splashed with it, but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine.",1434
5099,"The winds were out in their tops, and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening.",1434
5100,"The cows swung placidly down the lane, and Anne followed them dreamily, repeating aloud the battle canto from _Marmion_--which had also been part of their English course the preceding winter and which Miss Stacy had made them learn off by heart--and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery.",1435
5101,When she came to the lines,1435
5102,"       The stubborn spearsmen still made good        Their dark impenetrable wood,",1436
5103,she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy herself one of that heroic ring.,1437
5104,When she opened them again it was to behold Diana coming through the gate that led into the Barry field and looking so important that Anne instantly divined there was news to be told.,1437
5105,But betray too eager curiosity she would not.,1437
5106,"“Isn’t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana?",1438
5107,It makes me so glad to be alive.,1438
5108,In the mornings I always think the mornings are best; but when evening comes I think it’s lovelier still.”,1438
5109,"“It’s a very fine evening,” said Diana, “but oh, I have such news, Anne.",1439
5110,Guess.,1439
5111,You can have three guesses.”,1439
5112,"“Charlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and Mrs. Allan wants us to decorate it,” cried Anne.",1440
5113,“No.,1441
5114,"Charlotte’s beau won’t agree to that, because nobody ever has been married in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral.",1441
5115,"It’s too mean, because it would be such fun.",1441
5116,Guess again.”,1441
5117,“Jane’s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?”,1442
5118,"Diana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment.",1443
5119,"“I can’t think what it can be,” said Anne in despair, “unless it’s that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night.",1444
5120,Did he?”,1444
5121,"“I should think not,” exclaimed Diana indignantly.",1445
5122,"“I wouldn’t be likely to boast of it if he did, the horrid creature!",1445
5123,I knew you couldn’t guess it.,1445
5124,"Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today, and Aunt Josephine wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the Exhibition.",1445
5125,There!”,1445
5126,"“Oh, Diana,” whispered Anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support, “do you really mean it?",1446
5127,But I’m afraid Marilla won’t let me go.,1446
5128,She will say that she can’t encourage gadding about.,1446
5129,That was what she said last week when Jane invited me to go with them in their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel.,1446
5130,"I wanted to go, but Marilla said I’d be better at home learning my lessons and so would Jane.",1446
5131,"I was bitterly disappointed, Diana.",1446
5132,I felt so heartbroken that I wouldn’t say my prayers when I went to bed.,1446
5133,But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them.”,1446
5134,"“I’ll tell you,” said Diana, “we’ll get Mother to ask Marilla.",1447
5135,"She’ll be more likely to let you go then; and if she does we’ll have the time of our lives, Anne.",1447
5136,"I’ve never been to an Exhibition, and it’s so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips.",1447
5137,"Jane and Ruby have been twice, and they’re going this year again.”",1447
5138,"“I’m not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not,” said Anne resolutely.",1448
5139,"“If I did and then was disappointed, it would be more than I could bear.",1448
5140,But in case I do go I’m very glad my new coat will be ready by that time.,1448
5141,Marilla didn’t think I needed a new coat.,1448
5142,She said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress.,1448
5143,"The dress is very pretty, Diana--navy blue and made so fashionably.",1448
5144,"Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now, because she says she doesn’t intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them.",1448
5145,I’m so glad.,1448
5146,It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable.,1448
5147,"At least, it is easier for me.",1448
5148,I suppose it doesn’t make such a difference to naturally good people.,1448
5149,"But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth, and it’s being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody.",1448
5150,"It’s to be done Saturday night, and I’m trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap, because I’m afraid it isn’t right to imagine such things.",1448
5151,But it just slips into my mind in spite of me.,1448
5152,My cap is so pretty.,1448
5153,Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody.,1448
5154,"It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold cord and tassels.",1448
5155,"Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and so becoming.",1448
5156,When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend.,1448
5157,Do you suppose it’s wrong for us to think so much about our clothes?,1448
5158,Marilla says it is very sinful.,1448
5159,"But it is such an interesting subject, isn’t it?”",1448
5160,"Marilla agreed to let Anne go to town, and it was arranged that Mr. Barry should take the girls in on the following Tuesday.",1449
5161,"As Charlottetown was thirty miles away and Mr. Barry wished to go and return the same day, it was necessary to make a very early start.",1449
5162,"But Anne counted it all joy, and was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning.",1449
5163,"A glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine, for the eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all silvery and cloudless.",1449
5164,"Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the western gable of Orchard Slope, a token that Diana was also up.",1449
5165,"Anne was dressed by the time Matthew had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when Marilla came down, but for her own part was much too excited to eat.",1450
5166,"After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned, and Anne hastened over the brook and up through the firs to Orchard Slope.",1450
5167,"Mr. Barry and Diana were waiting for her, and they were soon on the road.",1450
5168,"It was a long drive, but Anne and Diana enjoyed every minute of it.",1451
5169,It was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields.,1451
5170,"The air was fresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills.",1451
5171,"Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made Anne’s flesh cringe with the old, half-delightful fear; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss.",1451
5172,"It was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to “Beechwood.”  It was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches.",1451
5173,Miss Barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes.,1451
5174,"“So you’ve come to see me at last, you Anne-girl,” she said.",1452
5175,"“Mercy, child, how you have grown!",1452
5176,"You’re taller than I am, I declare.",1452
5177,"And you’re ever so much better-looking than you used to be, too.",1452
5178,But I dare say you know that without being told.”,1452
5179,"“Indeed I didn’t,” said Anne radiantly.",1453
5180,"“I know I’m not so freckled as I used to be, so I’ve much to be thankful for, but I really hadn’t dared to hope there was any other improvement.",1453
5181,"I’m so glad you think there is, Miss Barry.” Miss Barry’s house was furnished with “great magnificence,”  as Anne told Marilla afterward.",1453
5182,The two little country girls were rather abashed by the splendor of the parlor where Miss Barry left them when she went to see about dinner.,1453
5183,“Isn’t it just like a palace?” whispered Diana.,1454
5184,"“I never was in Aunt Josephine’s house before, and I’d no idea it was so grand.",1454
5185,I just wish Julia Bell could see this--she puts on such airs about her mother’s parlor.”,1454
5186,"“Velvet carpet,” sighed Anne luxuriously, “and silk curtains!",1455
5187,"I’ve dreamed of such things, Diana.",1455
5188,But do you know I don’t believe I feel very comfortable with them after all.,1455
5189,There are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination.,1455
5190,That is one consolation when you are poor--there are so many more things you can imagine about.”,1455
5191,Their sojourn in town was something that Anne and Diana dated from for years.,1456
5192,From first to last it was crowded with delights.,1456
5193,On Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept them there all day.,1457
5194,"“It was splendid,” Anne related to Marilla later on.",1458
5195,“I never imagined anything so interesting.,1458
5196,I don’t really know which department was the most interesting.,1458
5197,I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best.,1458
5198,Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace.,1458
5199,I was real glad she did.,1458
5200,"And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I’m improving, don’t you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie’s success?",1458
5201,Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig.,1458
5202,"Diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs, but I don’t see why.",1458
5203,Do you?,1458
5204,She said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly.,1458
5205,"Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese.",1458
5206,"So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn’t it?",1458
5207,"Mrs. Lynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all those strangers.",1458
5208,"There were thousands of people there, Marilla.",1458
5209,It made me feel dreadfully insignificant.,1458
5210,And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races.,1458
5211,"Mrs. Lynde wouldn’t go; she said horse racing was an abomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away.",1458
5212,But there were so many there I don’t believe Mrs. Lynde’s absence would ever be noticed.,1458
5213,"I don’t think, though, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_ awfully fascinating.",1458
5214,Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win.,1458
5215,"I didn’t believe he would, but I refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about everything, and I felt sure it wouldn’t do to tell her that.",1458
5216,It’s always wrong to do anything you can’t tell the minister’s wife.,1458
5217,It’s as good as an extra conscience to have a minister’s wife for your friend.,1458
5218,"And I was very glad I didn’t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have lost ten cents.",1458
5219,So you see that virtue was its own reward.,1458
5220,We saw a man go up in a balloon.,1458
5221,"I’d love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would be simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes.",1458
5222,You paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you.,1458
5223,Miss Barry gave Diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told.,1458
5224,"Mine was that I would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go across water to live.",1458
5225,"I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that, but I didn’t care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose it’s too early to be looking out for him yet.",1458
5226,"Oh, it was a never-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla.",1458
5227,I was so tired I couldn’t sleep at night.,1458
5228,"Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise.",1458
5229,"It was an elegant room, Marilla, but somehow sleeping in a spare room isn’t what I used to think it was.",1458
5230,"That’s the worst of growing up, and I’m beginning to realize it.",1458
5231,The things you wanted so much when you were a child don’t seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.”,1458
5232,"Thursday the girls had a drive in the park, and in the evening Miss Barry took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna was to sing.",1459
5233,To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of delight.,1459
5234,"“Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description.",1460
5235,"I was so excited I couldn’t even talk, so you may know what it was like.",1460
5236,I just sat in enraptured silence.,1460
5237,"Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin and diamonds.",1460
5238,But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else.,1460
5239,"Oh, I can’t tell you how I felt.",1460
5240,But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more.,1460
5241,I felt like I do when I look up to the stars.,1460
5242,"Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.",1460
5243,"I was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn’t see how I was ever to return to common life again.",1460
5244,She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me.,1460
5245,That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found it true.,1460
5246,"The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o’clock at night.",1460
5247,Diana said she believed she was born for city life.,1460
5248,"Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought.",1460
5249,So I thought it over after I went to bed.,1460
5250,That is the best time to think things out.,1460
5251,"And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn’t born for city life and that I was glad of it.",1460
5252,"It’s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o’clock at night once in a while; but as a regular thing I’d rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook.",1460
5253,I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed.,1460
5254,"Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things.",1460
5255,"I don’t think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn’t trying to be funny.",1460
5256,But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.”,1460
5257,"Friday brought going-home time, and Mr. Barry drove in for the girls.",1461
5258,"“Well, I hope you’ve enjoyed yourselves,” said Miss Barry, as she bade them good-bye.",1462
5259,"“Indeed we have,” said Diana.",1463
5260,"“And you, Anne-girl?”",1464
5261,"“I’ve enjoyed every minute of the time,” said Anne, throwing her arms impulsively about the old woman’s neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek.",1465
5262,Diana would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at Anne’s freedom.,1465
5263,"But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her veranda and watched the buggy out of sight.",1465
5264,Then she went back into her big house with a sigh.,1465
5265,"It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young lives.",1465
5266,"Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself.",1465
5267,She valued people only as they were of service to her or amused her.,1465
5268,"Anne had amused her, and consequently stood high in the old lady’s good graces.",1465
5269,"But Miss Barry found herself thinking less about Anne’s quaint speeches than of her fresh enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little winning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes and lips.",1465
5270,"“I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she’d adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum,” she said to herself, “but I guess she didn’t make much of a mistake after all.",1466
5271,If I’d a child like Anne in the house all the time I’d be a better and happier woman.”,1466
5272,"Anne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in--pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at the end of it.",1467
5273,It was sunset when they passed through White Sands and turned into the shore road.,1467
5274,"Beyond, the Avonlea hills came out darkly against the saffron sky.",1467
5275,Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light.,1467
5276,Every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples.,1467
5277,"The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and the tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.",1467
5278,"“Oh, but it’s good to be alive and to be going home,” breathed Anne.",1468
5279,"When she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open door shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night.",1469
5280,"Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen, where a hot supper was waiting on the table.",1469
5281,"“So you’ve got back?” said Marilla, folding up her knitting.",1470
5282,"“Yes, and oh, it’s so good to be back,” said Anne joyously.",1471
5283,"“I could kiss everything, even to the clock.",1471
5284,"Marilla, a broiled chicken!",1471
5285,You don’t mean to say you cooked that for me!”,1471
5286,"“Yes, I did,” said Marilla.",1472
5287,“I thought you’d be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing.,1472
5288,"Hurry and take off your things, and we’ll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in.",1472
5289,"I’m glad you’ve got back, I must say.",1472
5290,"It’s been fearful lonesome here without you, and I never put in four longer days.”",1472
5291,"After supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and gave them a full account of her visit.",1473
5292,"“I’ve had a splendid time,” she concluded happily, “and I feel that it marks an epoch in my life.",1474
5293,But the best of it all was the coming home.”,1474
5294, CHAPTER XXX.,1476
5295,The Queen’s Class Is Organized,1476
5296, MARILLA laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair.,1477
5297,"Her eyes were tired, and she thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the next time she went to town, for her eyes had grown tired very often of late.",1477
5298,"It was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around Green Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove.",1478
5299,"Anne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood.",1479
5300,"She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.",1479
5301,Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in cloudland--adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life.,1479
5302,Marilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and shadow.,1480
5303,The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn.,1480
5304,"But she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness.",1480
5305,"Her love made her afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed.",1480
5306,"She had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set one’s heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her.",1480
5307,Certainly Anne herself had no idea how Marilla loved her.,1480
5308,She sometimes thought wistfully that Marilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding.,1480
5309,"But she always checked the thought reproachfully, remembering what she owed to Marilla.",1480
5310,"“Anne,” said Marilla abruptly, “Miss Stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with Diana.”",1481
5311,Anne came back from her other world with a start and a sigh.,1482
5312,“Was she?,1483
5313,"Oh, I’m so sorry I wasn’t in.",1483
5314,"Why didn’t you call me, Marilla?",1483
5315,Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood.,1483
5316,It’s lovely in the woods now.,1483
5317,"All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves.",1483
5318,I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it.,1483
5319,"Diana wouldn’t say much about that, though.",1483
5320,Diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood.,1483
5321,It had a very bad effect on Diana’s imagination.,1483
5322,It blighted it.,1483
5323,Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a blighted being.,1483
5324,"I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her.",1483
5325,"Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse she is.",1483
5326,"Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn’t do to drag them into everything, does it?",1483
5327,Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever.,1483
5328,"Diana hasn’t quite made up her mind though, because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild, dashing, wicked young man and reform him.",1483
5329,"Diana and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now, you know.",1483
5330,We feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it isn’t becoming to talk of childish matters.,1483
5331,"It’s such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla.",1483
5332,"Miss Stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and talked to us about it.",1483
5333,"She said we couldn’t be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life.",1483
5334,And she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it.,1483
5335,Diana and I talked the matter over coming home from school.,1483
5336,"We felt extremely solemn, Marilla.",1483
5337,"And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed.",1483
5338,"It’s perfectly appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla.",1483
5339,It sounds so fearfully old and grown up.,1483
5340,But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon?”,1483
5341,"“That is what I want to tell you, Anne, if you’ll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise.",1484
5342,She was talking about you.”,1484
5343,“About me?” Anne looked rather scared.,1485
5344,Then she flushed and exclaimed:,1485
5345,"“Oh, I know what she was saying.",1486
5346,"I meant to tell you, Marilla, honestly I did, but I forgot.",1486
5347,Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history.,1486
5348,Jane Andrews lent it to me.,1486
5349,"I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in.",1486
5350,"I was simply wild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldn’t be poetical justice if he didn’t--so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee.",1486
5351,"I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur.",1486
5352,"I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so reproachful-like.",1486
5353,"I can’t tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling.",1486
5354,"Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she never said a word then.",1486
5355,She kept me in at recess and talked to me.,1486
5356,She said I had done very wrong in two respects.,1486
5357,"First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead.",1486
5358,"I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful.",1486
5359,I was shocked.,1486
5360,"I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I’d never do such a thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned out.",1486
5361,"But Miss Stacy said she wouldn’t require that, and she forgave me freely.",1486
5362,So I think it wasn’t very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all.”,1486
5363,"“Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me, Anne, and its only your guilty conscience that’s the matter with you.",1487
5364,You have no business to be taking storybooks to school.,1487
5365,You read too many novels anyhow.,1487
5366,When I was a girl I wasn’t so much as allowed to look at a novel.”,1487
5367,"“Oh, how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it’s really such a religious book?” protested Anne.",1488
5368,"“Of course it’s a little too exciting to be proper reading for Sunday, and I only read it on weekdays.",1488
5369,And I never read _any_ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read.,1488
5370,Miss Stacy made me promise that.,1488
5371,"She found me reading a book one day called, The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall.",1488
5372,"It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me, and, oh, Marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy.",1488
5373,It just curdled the blood in my veins.,1488
5374,"But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome book, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it.",1488
5375,"I didn’t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it was _agonizing_ to give back that book without knowing how it turned out.",1488
5376,But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test and I did.,1488
5377,"It’s really wonderful, Marilla, what you can do when you’re truly anxious to please a certain person.”",1488
5378,"“Well, I guess I’ll light the lamp and get to work,” said Marilla.",1489
5379,“I see plainly that you don’t want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say.,1489
5380,You’re more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else.”,1489
5381,"“Oh, indeed, Marilla, I do want to hear it,” cried Anne contritely.",1490
5382,“I won’t say another word--not one.,1490
5383,"I know I talk too much, but I am really trying to overcome it, and although I say far too much, yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and don’t, you’d give me some credit for it.",1490
5384,"Please tell me, Marilla.”",1490
5385,"“Well, Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen’s.",1491
5386,She intends to give them extra lessons for an hour after school.,1491
5387,And she came to ask Matthew and me if we would like to have you join it.,1491
5388,"What do you think about it yourself, Anne?",1491
5389,Would you like to go to Queen’s and pass for a teacher?”,1491
5390,"“Oh, Marilla!” Anne straightened to her knees and clasped her hands.",1492
5391,"“It’s been the dream of my life--that is, for the last six months, ever since Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance.",1492
5392,"But I didn’t say anything about it, because I supposed it would be perfectly useless.",1492
5393,I’d love to be a teacher.,1492
5394,But won’t it be dreadfully expensive?,1492
5395,"Mr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy through, and Prissy wasn’t a dunce in geometry.”",1492
5396,“I guess you needn’t worry about that part of it.,1493
5397,When Matthew and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education.,1493
5398,I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not.,1493
5399,"You’ll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world, and it’s just as well to be prepared.",1493
5400,"So you can join the Queen’s class if you like, Anne.”",1493
5401,"“Oh, Marilla, thank you.” Anne flung her arms about Marilla’s waist and looked up earnestly into her face.",1494
5402,“I’m extremely grateful to you and Matthew.,1494
5403,And I’ll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you.,1494
5404,"I warn you not to expect much in geometry, but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard.”",1494
5405,“I dare say you’ll get along well enough.,1495
5406,Miss Stacy says you are bright and diligent.” Not for worlds would Marilla have told Anne just what Miss Stacy had said about her; that would have been to pamper vanity.,1495
5407,“You needn’t rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books.,1495
5408,There is no hurry.,1495
5409,You won’t be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half yet.,1495
5410,"But it’s well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded, Miss Stacy says.”",1495
5411,"“I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,” said Anne blissfully, “because I have a purpose in life.",1496
5412,Mr. Allan says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully.,1496
5413,Only he says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose.,1496
5414,"I would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy, wouldn’t you, Marilla?",1496
5415,I think it’s a very noble profession.”,1496
5416,The Queen’s class was organized in due time.,1497
5417,"Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, Ruby Gillis, Jane Andrews, Josie Pye, Charlie Sloane, and Moody Spurgeon MacPherson joined it.",1497
5418,"Diana Barry did not, as her parents did not intend to send her to Queen’s.",1497
5419,This seemed nothing short of a calamity to Anne.,1497
5420,"Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the croup, had she and Diana been separated in anything.",1497
5421,"On the evening when the Queen’s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and Anne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through the Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum.",1497
5422,"A lump came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes.",1497
5423,Not for worlds would Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.,1497
5424,"“But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out alone,” she said mournfully that night.",1498
5425,"“I thought how splendid it would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too.",1498
5426,"But we can’t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says.",1498
5427,"Mrs. Lynde isn’t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there’s no doubt she says a great many very true things.",1498
5428,And I think the Queen’s class is going to be extremely interesting.,1498
5429,Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers.,1498
5430,That is the height of their ambition.,1498
5431,"Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married.",1498
5432,"Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won’t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money.",1498
5433,"I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings.",1498
5434,"Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education’s sake, because she won’t have to earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--_they_ have to hustle.",1498
5435,Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister.,1498
5436,Mrs. Lynde says he couldn’t be anything else with a name like that to live up to.,1498
5437,"I hope it isn’t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.",1498
5438,"He’s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps.",1498
5439,But perhaps he will be more intellectual-looking when he grows up.,1498
5440,"Charlie Sloane says he’s going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde says he’ll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest people, and it’s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.”",1498
5441,"“What is Gilbert Blythe going to be?” queried Marilla, seeing that Anne was opening her Cæsar.",1499
5442,"“I don’t happen to know what Gilbert Blythe’s ambition in life is--if he has any,” said Anne scornfully.",1500
5443,There was open rivalry between Gilbert and Anne now.,1501
5444,"Previously the rivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt that Gilbert was as determined to be first in class as Anne was.",1501
5445,He was a foeman worthy of her steel.,1501
5446,"The other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete with them.",1501
5447,"Since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for forgiveness, Gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry, had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of Anne Shirley.",1502
5448,"He talked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with them, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club.",1502
5449,"But Anne Shirley he simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored.",1502
5450,It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care.,1502
5451,"Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart she knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake of Shining Waters again she would answer very differently.",1502
5452,"All at once, as it seemed, and to her secret dismay, she found that the old resentment she had cherished against him was gone--gone just when she most needed its sustaining power.",1502
5453,It was in vain that she recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger.,1502
5454,That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker.,1502
5455,Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it.,1502
5456,But it was too late.,1502
5457,"And at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should ever suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn’t been so proud and horrid!",1503
5458,"She determined to “shroud her feelings in deepest oblivion,” and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so successfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his retaliatory scorn.",1503
5459,"The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed Charlie Sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.",1503
5460,Otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies.,1504
5461,For Anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year.,1504
5462,"She was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be learned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be practiced for the Sunday-school choir; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the manse with Mrs. Allan; and then, almost before Anne realized it, spring had come again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once more.",1504
5463,"Studies palled just a wee bit then; the Queen’s class, left behind in school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that Latin verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months.",1505
5464,Even Anne and Gilbert lagged and grew indifferent.,1505
5465,Teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them.,1505
5466,"“But you’ve done good work this past year,” Miss Stacy told them on the last evening, “and you deserve a good, jolly vacation.",1506
5467,Have the best time you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year.,1506
5468,"It will be the tug of war, you know--the last year before the Entrance.”",1506
5469,"“Are you going to be back next year, Miss Stacy?” asked Josie Pye.",1507
5470,"Josie Pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of the class felt grateful to her; none of them would have dared to ask it of Miss Stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors running at large through the school for some time that Miss Stacy was not coming back the next year--that she had been offered a position in the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept.",1508
5471,The Queen’s class listened in breathless suspense for her answer.,1508
5472,"“Yes, I think I will,” said Miss Stacy.",1509
5473,"“I thought of taking another school, but I have decided to come back to Avonlea.",1509
5474,"To tell the truth, I’ve grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I couldn’t leave them.",1509
5475,So I’ll stay and see you through.”,1509
5476,“Hurrah!” said Moody Spurgeon.,1510
5477,"Moody Spurgeon had never been so carried away by his feelings before, and he blushed uncomfortably every time he thought about it for a week.",1510
5478,"“Oh, I’m so glad,” said Anne, with shining eyes.",1511
5479,"“Dear Stacy, it would be perfectly dreadful if you didn’t come back.",1511
5480,I don’t believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here.”,1511
5481,"When Anne got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box.",1512
5482,"“I’m not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,” she told Marilla.",1513
5483,"“I’ve studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I’ve pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart, even when the letters _are_ changed.",1513
5484,I just feel tired of everything sensible and I’m going to let my imagination run riot for the summer.,1513
5485,"Oh, you needn’t be alarmed, Marilla.",1513
5486,I’ll only let it run riot within reasonable limits.,1513
5487,"But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it’s the last summer I’ll be a little girl.",1513
5488,Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I’ve done this I’ll have to put on longer skirts.,1513
5489,She says I’m all running to legs and eyes.,1513
5490,And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified.,1513
5491,"It won’t even do to believe in fairies then, I’m afraid; so I’m going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer.",1513
5492,I think we’re going to have a very gay vacation.,1513
5493,Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there’s the Sunday-school picnic and the missionary concert next month.,1513
5494,And Mr. Barry says that some evening he’ll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there.,1513
5495,"They have dinner there in the evening, you know.",1513
5496,Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses.,1513
5497,Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and she’ll never forget it to her dying day.”,1513
5498,Mrs. Lynde came up the next afternoon to find out why Marilla had not been at the Aid meeting on Thursday.,1514
5499,When Marilla was not at Aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at Green Gables.,1514
5500,"“Matthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,” Marilla explained, “and I didn’t feel like leaving him.",1515
5501,"Oh, yes, he’s all right again now, but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I’m anxious about him.",1515
5502,The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement.,1515
5503,"That’s easy enough, for Matthew doesn’t go about looking for excitement by any means and never did, but he’s not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work.",1515
5504,"Come and lay off your things, Rachel.",1515
5505,You’ll stay to tea?”,1515
5506,"“Well, seeing you’re so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay” said Mrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.",1516
5507,Mrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even Mrs. Rachel’s criticism.,1517
5508,"“I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,” admitted Mrs. Rachel, as Marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset.",1518
5509,“She must be a great help to you.”,1518
5510,"“She is,” said Marilla, “and she’s real steady and reliable now.",1519
5511,"I used to be afraid she’d never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has and I wouldn’t be afraid to trust her in anything now.”",1519
5512,"“I never would have thought she’d have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago,” said Mrs. Rachel.",1520
5513,"“Lawful heart, shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers!",1520
5514,"When I went home that night I says to Thomas, says I, ‘Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert ‘ll live to rue the step she’s took.’ But I was mistaken and I’m real glad of it.",1520
5515,"I ain’t one of those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to own up that they’ve made a mistake.",1520
5516,"No, that never was my way, thank goodness.",1520
5517,"I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren’t no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that’s what.",1520
5518,There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children.,1520
5519,"It’s nothing short of wonderful how she’s improved these three years, but especially in looks.",1520
5520,"She’s a real pretty girl got to be, though I can’t say I’m overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself.",1520
5521,"I like more snap and color, like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis.",1520
5522,Ruby Gillis’s looks are real showy.,1520
5523,"But somehow--I don’t know how it is but when Anne and them are together, though she ain’t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common and overdone--something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that’s what.”",1520
5524, CHAPTER XXXI.,1522
5525,Where the Brook and River Meet,1522
5526, ANNE had her “good” summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly.,1523
5527,"She and Diana fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover’s Lane and the Dryad’s Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded.",1523
5528,Marilla offered no objections to Anne’s gypsyings.,1523
5529,"The Spencervale doctor who had come the night Minnie May had the croup met Anne at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to Marilla Cuthbert by another person.",1523
5530,It was:,1523
5531,“Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don’t let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.”,1524
5532,This message frightened Marilla wholesomely.,1525
5533,She read Anne’s death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed.,1525
5534,"As a result, Anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went.",1525
5535,"She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart’s content; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more.",1525
5536,"“I feel just like studying with might and main,” she declared as she brought her books down from the attic.",1526
5537,"“Oh, you good old friends, I’m glad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry.",1526
5538,"I’ve had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I’m rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday.",1526
5539,Doesn’t Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons?,1526
5540,Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we’ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher.,1526
5541,"But I don’t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla?",1526
5542,I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him.,1526
5543,If I were a man I think I’d be a minister.,1526
5544,"They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers’ hearts.",1526
5545,"Why can’t women be ministers, Marilla?",1526
5546,I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing.,1526
5547,"She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn’t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would.",1526
5548,But I don’t see why.,1526
5549,I think women would make splendid ministers.,1526
5550,When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.,1526
5551,I’m sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell and I’ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.”,1526
5552,"“Yes, I believe she could,” said Marilla dryly.",1527
5553,“She does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is.,1527
5554,Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.”,1527
5555,"“Marilla,” said Anne in a burst of confidence, “I want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it.",1528
5556,"It has worried me terribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such matters.",1528
5557,I do really want to be good; and when I’m with you or Mrs. Allan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of.,1528
5558,But mostly when I’m with Mrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I oughtn’t to do.,1528
5559,I feel irresistibly tempted to do it.,1528
5560,"Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that?",1528
5561,Do you think it’s because I’m really bad and unregenerate?”,1528
5562,Marilla looked dubious for a moment.,1529
5563,Then she laughed.,1529
5564,"“If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very effect on me.",1530
5565,"I sometimes think she’d have more of an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she didn’t keep nagging people to do right.",1530
5566,There should have been a special commandment against nagging.,1530
5567,"But there, I shouldn’t talk so.",1530
5568,Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well.,1530
5569,There isn’t a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.”,1530
5570,"“I’m very glad you feel the same,” said Anne decidedly.",1531
5571,“It’s so encouraging.,1531
5572,I shan’t worry so much over that after this.,1531
5573,But I dare say there’ll be other things to worry me.,1531
5574,"They keep coming up new all the time--things to perplex you, you know.",1531
5575,You settle one question and there’s another right after.,1531
5576,There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you’re beginning to grow up.,1531
5577,It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right.,1531
5578,"It’s a serious thing to grow up, isn’t it, Marilla?",1531
5579,"But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully, and I’m sure it will be my own fault if I don’t.",1531
5580,I feel it’s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance.,1531
5581,If I don’t grow up right I can’t go back and begin over again.,1531
5582,"I’ve grown two inches this summer, Marilla.",1531
5583,Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby’s party.,1531
5584,I’m so glad you made my new dresses longer.,1531
5585,That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce.,1531
5586,"Of course I know it wasn’t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses.",1531
5587,I know I’ll be able to study better because of mine.,1531
5588,I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce.”,1531
5589,"“It’s worth something to have that,” admitted Marilla.",1532
5590,Miss Stacy came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more.,1533
5591,"Especially did the Queen’s class gird up their loins for the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as “the Entrance,”  at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes.",1533
5592,Suppose they did not pass!,1533
5593,"That thought was doomed to haunt Anne through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems.",1533
5594,"When Anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Gilbert Blythe’s name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.",1533
5595,"But it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter.",1534
5596,"Schoolwork was as interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore.",1534
5597,"New worlds of thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before Anne’s eager eyes.",1534
5598,      “Hills peeped o’er hill and Alps on Alps arose.”,1535
5599,"Much of all this was due to Miss Stacy’s tactful, careful, broadminded guidance.",1536
5600,"She led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked Mrs. Lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously.",1536
5601,"Apart from her studies Anne expanded socially, for Marilla, mindful of the Spencervale doctor’s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings.",1537
5602,The Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore.,1537
5603,"Between times Anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that Marilla was astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl was taller than herself.",1538
5604,"“Why, Anne, how you’ve grown!” she said, almost unbelievingly.",1539
5605,A sigh followed on the words.,1539
5606,Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne’s inches.,1539
5607,"The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head, in her place.",1539
5608,"Marilla loved the girl as much as she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss.",1539
5609,"And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting with Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry.",1539
5610,"Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through her tears.",1539
5611,"“I was thinking about Anne,” she explained.",1540
5612,“She’s got to be such a big girl--and she’ll probably be away from us next winter.,1540
5613,I’ll miss her terrible.”,1540
5614,"“She’ll be able to come home often,” comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was as yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home from Bright River on that June evening four years before.",1541
5615,“The branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time.”,1541
5616,"“It won’t be the same thing as having her here all the time,” sighed Marilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.",1542
5617,“But there--men can’t understand these things!”,1542
5618,There were other changes in Anne no less real than the physical change.,1543
5619,"For one thing, she became much quieter.",1543
5620,"Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less.",1543
5621,Marilla noticed and commented on this also.,1543
5622,"“You don’t chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as many big words.",1544
5623,What has come over you?”,1544
5624,"Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.",1545
5625,"“I don’t know--I don’t want to talk as much,” she said, denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger.",1546
5626,"“It’s nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one’s heart, like treasures.",1546
5627,I don’t like to have them laughed at or wondered over.,1546
5628,And somehow I don’t want to use big words any more.,1546
5629,"It’s almost a pity, isn’t it, now that I’m really growing big enough to say them if I did want to.",1546
5630,"It’s fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it’s not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla.",1546
5631,There’s so much to learn and do and think that there isn’t time for big words.,1546
5632,"Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better.",1546
5633,She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible.,1546
5634,It was hard at first.,1546
5635,I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of--and I thought of any number of them.,1546
5636,But I’ve got used to it now and I see it’s so much better.”,1546
5637,“What has become of your story club?,1547
5638,I haven’t heard you speak of it for a long time.”,1547
5639,“The story club isn’t in existence any longer.,1548
5640,We hadn’t time for it--and anyhow I think we had got tired of it.,1548
5641,It was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries.,1548
5642,"Miss Stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she won’t let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too.",1548
5643,I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them myself.,1548
5644,"I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic.",1548
5645,And so I am trying to.”,1548
5646,"“You’ve only two more months before the Entrance,” said Marilla.",1549
5647,“Do you think you’ll be able to get through?”,1549
5648,Anne shivered.,1550
5649,“I don’t know.,1551
5650,Sometimes I think I’ll be all right--and then I get horribly afraid.,1551
5651,"We’ve studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us thoroughly, but we mayn’t get through for all that.",1551
5652,We’ve each got a stumbling block.,1551
5653,"Mine is geometry of course, and Jane’s is Latin, and Ruby and Charlie’s is algebra, and Josie’s is arithmetic.",1551
5654,Moody Spurgeon says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history.,1551
5655,"Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we’ll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we’ll have some idea.",1551
5656,"I wish it was all over, Marilla.",1551
5657,It haunts me.,1551
5658,Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I’ll do if I don’t pass.”,1551
5659,"“Why, go to school next year and try again,” said Marilla unconcernedly.",1552
5660,"“Oh, I don’t believe I’d have the heart for it.",1553
5661,"It would be such a disgrace to fail, especially if Gil--if the others passed.",1553
5662,And I get so nervous in an examination that I’m likely to make a mess of it.,1553
5663,I wish I had nerves like Jane Andrews.,1553
5664,Nothing rattles her.”,1553
5665,"Anne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book.",1554
5666,"There would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the Entrance, Anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them.",1554
5667, CHAPTER XXXII.,1556
5668,The Pass List Is Out,1556
5669, WITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss Stacy’s rule in Avonlea school.,1557
5670,Anne and Diana walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed.,1557
5671,Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy’s farewell words must have been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips’s had been under similar circumstances three years before.,1557
5672,Diana looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.,1557
5673,"“It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn’t it?” she said dismally.",1558
5674,"“You oughtn’t to feel half as badly as I do,” said Anne, hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief.",1559
5675,"“You’ll be back again next winter, but I suppose I’ve left the dear old school forever--if I have good luck, that is.”",1559
5676,“It won’t be a bit the same.,1560
5677,"Miss Stacy won’t be there, nor you nor Jane nor Ruby probably.",1560
5678,"I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn’t bear to have another deskmate after you.",1560
5679,"Oh, we have had jolly times, haven’t we, Anne?",1560
5680,It’s dreadful to think they’re all over.”,1560
5681,Two big tears rolled down by Diana’s nose.,1561
5682,"“If you would stop crying I could,” said Anne imploringly.",1562
5683,“Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again.,1562
5684,"As Mrs. Lynde says, ‘If you can’t be cheerful, be as cheerful as you can.’ After all, I dare say I’ll be back next year.",1562
5685,This is one of the times I _know_ I’m not going to pass.,1562
5686,They’re getting alarmingly frequent.”,1562
5687,"“Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.”",1563
5688,"“Yes, but those exams didn’t make me nervous.",1564
5689,When I think of the real thing you can’t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart.,1564
5690,And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it’s so unlucky.,1564
5691,I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference.,1564
5692,But still I wish it wasn’t thirteen.”,1564
5693,"“I do wish I was going in with you,” said Diana.",1565
5694,“Wouldn’t we have a perfectly elegant time?,1565
5695,But I suppose you’ll have to cram in the evenings.”,1565
5696,“No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all.,1566
5697,She says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early.,1566
5698,"It’s good advice, but I expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think.",1566
5699,Prissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up _at least_ as long as she did.,1566
5700,It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to ask me to stay at Beechwood while I’m in town.”,1566
5701,"“You’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”",1567
5702,"“I’ll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,” promised Anne.",1568
5703,"“I’ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,” vowed Diana.",1569
5704,"Anne went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Diana haunted the post office, as agreed, and got her letter.",1570
5706,“Here it is Tuesday night and I’m writing this in the library at Beechwood.,1572
5707,Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me.,1572
5708,"I couldn’t ‘cram’ because I’d promised Miss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned.",1572
5709,"“This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way.",1573
5710,Ruby asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice.,1573
5711,Josie said I looked as if I hadn’t slept a wink and she didn’t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher’s course even if I did get through.,1573
5712,There are times and seasons even yet when I don’t feel that I’ve made any great headway in learning to like Josie Pye!,1573
5713,“When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island.,1574
5714,The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself.,1574
5715,"Jane asked him what on earth he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity’s sake not to interrupt him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place!",1574
5716,“When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us.,1575
5717,Jane and I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her.,1575
5718,"No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane!",1575
5719,I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room.,1575
5720,Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets.,1575
5721,My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up.,1575
5722,"Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.",1575
5723,“At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon.,1576
5724,The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates.,1576
5725,"Still, I think I did fairly well today.",1576
5726,"But oh, Diana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid.",1576
5727,If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.,1576
5728,“I went down to see the other girls this evening.,1577
5729,On my way I met Moody Spurgeon wandering distractedly around.,1577
5730,"He said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister, anyhow.",1577
5731,I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn’t.,1577
5732,"Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I’m always glad I’m a girl and not his sister.",1577
5733,“Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper.,1578
5734,When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream.,1578
5735,How we wished you had been with us.,1578
5736,"“Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over!",1579
5737,"But there, as Mrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in geometry or not.",1579
5738,That is true but not especially comforting.,1579
5739,I think I’d rather it didn’t go on if I failed!,1579
5740,"“Yours devotedly, “Anne”",1580
5741," The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and Anne arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her.",1581
5742,Diana was over at Green Gables when she arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years.,1581
5743,"“You old darling, it’s perfectly splendid to see you back again.",1582
5744,"It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Anne, how did you get along?”",1582
5745,"“Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry.",1583
5746,"I don’t know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I didn’t.",1583
5747,"Oh, how good it is to be back!",1583
5748,"Green Gables is the dearest, loveliest spot in the world.”",1583
5749,“How did the others do?”,1584
5750,"“The girls say they know they didn’t pass, but I think they did pretty well.",1585
5751,Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!,1585
5752,Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he failed in algebra.,1585
5753,But we don’t really know anything about it and won’t until the pass list is out.,1585
5754,That won’t be for a fortnight.,1585
5755,Fancy living a fortnight in such suspense!,1585
5756,I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over.”,1585
5757,"Diana knew it would be useless to ask how Gilbert Blythe had fared, so she merely said:",1586
5758,"“Oh, you’ll pass all right.",1587
5759,Don’t worry.”,1587
5760,"“I’d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list,” flashed Anne, by which she meant--and Diana knew she meant--that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of Gilbert Blythe.",1588
5761,With this end in view Anne had strained every nerve during the examinations.,1589
5762,So had Gilbert.,1589
5763,"They had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Anne had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friends with Gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination.",1589
5764,She knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question and that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed.,1589
5765,But she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well.,1590
5766,She wanted to “pass high” for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.,1590
5767,"Matthew had declared to her his conviction that she “would beat the whole Island.” That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dreams.",1590
5768,"But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew’s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement.",1590
5769,"That, she felt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.",1590
5770,"At the end of the fortnight Anne took to “haunting” the post office also, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings as bad as any experienced during the Entrance week.",1591
5771,"Charlie and Gilbert were not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely away.",1591
5772,"“I haven’t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,”  he told Anne.",1592
5773,“I’m just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I’ve passed or not.”,1592
5774,When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began to feel that she really couldn’t stand the strain much longer.,1593
5775,Her appetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.,1593
5776,"Mrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting Anne’s paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if he hadn’t better vote Grit at the next election.",1593
5777,But one evening the news came.,1594
5778,"Anne was sitting at her open window, for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars.",1594
5779,"The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.",1594
5780,"Anne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained.",1595
5781,The pass list was out!,1595
5782,Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her.,1595
5783,She could not move a step.,1595
5784,"It seemed an hour to her before Diana came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so great was her excitement.",1595
5785,"“Anne, you’ve passed,” she cried, “passed the _very first_--you and Gilbert both--you’re ties--but your name is first.",1596
5786,"Oh, I’m so proud!”",1596
5787,"Diana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne’s bed, utterly breathless and incapable of further speech.",1597
5788,"Anne lighted the lamp, oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could accomplish the task.",1597
5789,Then she snatched up the paper.,1597
5790,"Yes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred!",1597
5791,That moment was worth living for.,1597
5792,"“You did just splendidly, Anne,” puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word.",1598
5793,"“Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won’t be here till tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing.",1598
5794,"You’ve all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon and all, although he’s conditioned in history.",1598
5795,Jane and Ruby did pretty well--they’re halfway up--and so did Charlie.,1598
5796,"Josie just scraped through with three marks to spare, but you’ll see she’ll put on as many airs as if she’d led.",1598
5797,Won’t Miss Stacy be delighted?,1598
5798,"Oh, Anne, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that?",1598
5799,If it were me I know I’d go crazy with joy.,1598
5800,"I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you’re as calm and cool as a spring evening.”",1598
5801,"“I’m just dazzled inside,” said Anne.",1599
5802,"“I want to say a hundred things, and I can’t find words to say them in.",1599
5803,"I never dreamed of this--yes, I did too, just once!",1599
5804,"I let myself think _once_, ‘What if I should come out first?’ quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island.",1599
5805,"Excuse me a minute, Diana.",1599
5806,I must run right out to the field to tell Matthew.,1599
5807,Then we’ll go up the road and tell the good news to the others.”,1599
5808,"They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at the lane fence.",1600
5809,"“Oh, Matthew,” exclaimed Anne, “I’ve passed and I’m first--or one of the first!",1601
5810,"I’m not vain, but I’m thankful.”",1601
5811,"“Well now, I always said it,” said Matthew, gazing at the pass list delightedly.",1602
5812,“I knew you could beat them all easy.”,1602
5813,"“You’ve done pretty well, I must say, Anne,” said Marilla, trying to hide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel’s critical eye.",1603
5814,But that good soul said heartily:,1603
5815,"“I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in saying it.",1604
5816,"You’re a credit to your friends, Anne, that’s what, and we’re all proud of you.”",1604
5817,"That night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her heart.",1605
5818,There was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire.,1605
5819, CHAPTER XXXIII.,1607
5820,The Hotel Concert,1607
5821," PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,” advised Diana decidedly.",1608
5822,They were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only twilight--a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless sky.,1609
5823,"A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet summer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway voices and laughter.",1609
5824,"But in Anne’s room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted, for an important toilet was being made.",1609
5825,"The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill.",1610
5826,"Changes had crept in, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire.",1610
5827,"The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of Anne’s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams had kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented them.",1611
5828,"The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin.",1611
5829,"The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few good pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan.",1611
5830,"Miss Stacy’s photograph occupied the place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it.",1611
5831,Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance.,1611
5832,"There was no “mahogany furniture,” but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a low white bed.",1611
5833,Anne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel.,1612
5834,"The guests had got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along.",1612
5835,Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a violin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad; and Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to recite.,1612
5836,"As Anne would have said at one time, it was “an epoch in her life,” and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it.",1613
5837,"Matthew was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his Anne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather than admit it, and said she didn’t think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them.",1613
5838,Anne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother Billy in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and boys were going too.,1614
5839,"There was a party of visitors expected out from town, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.",1614
5840,“Do you really think the organdy will be best?” queried Anne anxiously.,1615
5841,“I don’t think it’s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it certainly isn’t so fashionable.”,1615
5842,"“But it suits you ever so much better,” said Diana.",1616
5843,“It’s so soft and frilly and clinging.,1616
5844,"The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too dressed up.",1616
5845,But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.”,1616
5846,Anne sighed and yielded.,1617
5847,"Diana was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much sought after.",1617
5848,"She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance.",1617
5849,"All her pains were bestowed upon Anne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and combed and adorned to the Queen’s taste.",1617
5850,"“Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now for your slippers.",1618
5851,"I’m going to braid your hair in two thick braids, and tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don’t pull out a single curl over your forehead--just have the soft part.",1618
5852,"There is no way you do your hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a Madonna when you part it so.",1618
5853,I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear.,1618
5854,"There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for you.”",1618
5855,“Shall I put my pearl beads on?” asked Anne.,1619
5856,"“Matthew brought me a string from town last week, and I know he’d like to see them on me.”",1619
5857,"Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Anne’s slim milk-white throat.",1620
5858,"“There’s something so stylish about you, Anne,” said Diana, with unenvious admiration.",1621
5859,“You hold your head with such an air.,1621
5860,I suppose it’s your figure.,1621
5861,I am just a dumpling.,1621
5862,"I’ve always been afraid of it, and now I know it is so.",1621
5863,"Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.”",1621
5864,"“But you have such dimples,” said Anne, smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her own.",1622
5865,"“Lovely dimples, like little dents in cream.",1622
5866,I have given up all hope of dimples.,1622
5867,My dimple-dream will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn’t complain.,1622
5868,Am I all ready now?”,1622
5869,"“All ready,” assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much softer face.",1623
5870,"“Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.",1623
5871,Doesn’t she look lovely?”,1623
5872,Marilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.,1624
5873,“She looks neat and proper.,1625
5874,I like that way of fixing her hair.,1625
5875,"But I expect she’ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights.",1625
5876,"Organdy’s the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when he got it.",1625
5877,But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.,1625
5878,"Time was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Anne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him.",1625
5879,"Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Matthew plunks his money down for it.",1625
5880,"Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.”",1625
5881,"Then Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked, with that",1626
5882,     “One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown”,1627
5883,and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl recite.,1628
5884,"“I wonder if it _is_ too damp for my dress,” said Anne anxiously.",1629
5885,"“Not a bit of it,” said Diana, pulling up the window blind.",1630
5886,"“It’s a perfect night, and there won’t be any dew.",1630
5887,Look at the moonlight.”,1630
5888,"“I’m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,” said Anne, going over to Diana.",1631
5889,“It’s so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops.,1631
5890,"It’s new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine.",1631
5891,"Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly.",1631
5892,I don’t know how I’ll get along without it when I go to town next month.”,1631
5893,"“Don’t speak of your going away tonight,” begged Diana.",1632
5894,"“I don’t want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening.",1632
5895,"What are you going to recite, Anne?",1632
5896,And are you nervous?”,1632
5897,“Not a bit.,1633
5898,I’ve recited so often in public I don’t mind at all now.,1633
5899,I’ve decided to give ‘The Maiden’s Vow.’ It’s so pathetic.,1633
5900,"Laura Spencer is going to give a comic recitation, but I’d rather make people cry than laugh.”",1633
5901,“What will you recite if they encore you?”,1634
5902,"“They won’t dream of encoring me,” scoffed Anne, who was not without her own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling Matthew all about it at the next morning’s breakfast table.",1635
5903,“There are Billy and Jane now--I hear the wheels.,1635
5904,Come on.”,1635
5905,"Billy Andrews insisted that Anne should ride on the front seat with him, so she unwillingly climbed up.",1636
5906,"She would have much preferred to sit back with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart’s content.",1636
5907,There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy.,1636
5908,"He was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts.",1636
5909,"But he admired Anne immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him.",1636
5910,"Anne, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to Billy--who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late--contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all.",1637
5911,It was a night for enjoyment.,1637
5912,"The road was full of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed and reechoed along it.",1637
5913,When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom.,1637
5914,"They were met by the ladies of the concert committee, one of whom took Anne off to the performers’ dressing room which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among whom Anne felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified.",1637
5915,"Her dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now seemed simple and plain--too simple and plain, she thought, among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her.",1637
5916,"What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her?",1637
5917,And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore!,1637
5918,"Anne laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into a corner.",1637
5919,She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables.,1637
5920,"It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel, where she presently found herself.",1638
5921,"The electric lights dazzled her eyes, the perfume and hum bewildered her.",1638
5922,"She wished she were sitting down in the audience with Diana and Jane, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back.",1638
5923,"She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress.",1638
5924,"The stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Anne through her eyeglasses until Anne, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the “country bumpkins”  and “rustic belles” in the audience, languidly anticipating “such fun”  from the displays of local talent on the program.",1638
5925,Anne believed that she would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.,1638
5926,"Unfortunately for Anne, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite.",1639
5927,"She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her neck and in her dark hair.",1639
5928,She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her selection.,1639
5929,"Anne, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face.",1639
5930,She could never get up and recite after that--never.,1639
5931,Had she ever thought she could recite?,1639
5932,"Oh, if she were only back at Green Gables!",1639
5933,At this unpropitious moment her name was called.,1640
5934,"Somehow Anne--who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.",1640
5935,"She was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each other’s hands in nervous sympathy.",1640
5936,Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright.,1641
5937,"Often as she had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience as this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.",1641
5938,"Everything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of ladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her.",1641
5939,"Very different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors.",1641
5940,"These people, she thought, would be merciless critics.",1641
5941,"Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her “rustic” efforts.",1641
5942,"She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and miserable.",1641
5943,"Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt, must ever after be her portion if she did so.",1641
5944,"But suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending forward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once triumphant and taunting.",1642
5945,In reality it was nothing of the kind.,1642
5946,Gilbert was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by Anne’s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular.,1642
5947,"Josie Pye, whom he had driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting.",1642
5948,"But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if she had.",1642
5949,"She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock.",1642
5950,"She _would not_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her, never, never!",1642
5951,"Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break.",1642
5952,"Self-possession was fully restored to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before.",1642
5953,When she finished there were bursts of honest applause.,1642
5954,"Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk.",1642
5955,"“My dear, you did splendidly,” she puffed.",1643
5956,"“I’ve been crying like a baby, actually I have.",1643
5957,"There, they’re encoring you--they’re bound to have you back!”",1643
5958,"“Oh, I can’t go,” said Anne confusedly.",1644
5959,"“But yet--I must, or Matthew will be disappointed.",1644
5960,He said they would encore me.”,1644
5961,"“Then don’t disappoint Matthew,” said the pink lady, laughing.",1645
5962,"Smiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint, funny little selection that captivated her audience still further.",1646
5963,The rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.,1646
5964,"When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of an American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her.",1647
5965,"The professional elocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that she had a charming voice and “interpreted” her selections beautifully.",1647
5966,Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment.,1647
5967,"They had supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne, but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation.",1647
5968,"He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance.",1647
5969,"Anne breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.",1647
5970,"Oh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!",1648
5971,"How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts.",1648
5972,"“Hasn’t it been a perfectly splendid time?” sighed Jane, as they drove away.",1649
5973,“I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day.,1649
5974,I’m sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school.,1649
5975,"Anne, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you were never going to begin.",1649
5976,I think it was better than Mrs. Evans’s.”,1649
5977,"“Oh, no, don’t say things like that, Jane,” said Anne quickly, “because it sounds silly.",1650
5978,"It couldn’t be better than Mrs. Evans’s, you know, for she is a professional, and I’m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting.",1650
5979,I’m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.”,1650
5980,"“I’ve a compliment for you, Anne,” said Diana.",1651
5981,“At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in.,1651
5982,Part of it was anyhow.,1651
5983,"There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes.",1651
5984,"Josie Pye says he is a distinguished artist, and that her mother’s cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him.",1651
5985,"Well, we heard him say--didn’t we, Jane?--‘Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair?",1651
5986,"She has a face I should like to paint.’ There now, Anne.",1651
5987,But what does Titian hair mean?”,1651
5988,"“Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,” laughed Anne.",1652
5989,“Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.”,1652
5990,“_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?” sighed Jane.,1653
5991,“They were simply dazzling.,1653
5992,"Wouldn’t you just love to be rich, girls?”",1653
5993,"“We _are_ rich,” said Anne staunchly.",1654
5994,"“Why, we have sixteen years to our credit, and we’re happy as queens, and we’ve all got imaginations, more or less.",1654
5995,"Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen.",1654
5996,We couldn’t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds.,1654
5997,You wouldn’t change into any of those women if you could.,1654
5998,"Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you’d been born turning up your nose at the world?",1654
5999,"Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that you’d really no figure at all?",1654
6000,"Or even Mrs. Evans, with that sad, sad look in her eyes?",1654
6001,She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look.,1654
6002,"You _know_ you wouldn’t, Jane Andrews!”",1654
6003,"“I _don’t_ know--exactly,” said Jane unconvinced.",1655
6004,“I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.”,1655
6005,"“Well, I don’t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life,” declared Anne.",1656
6006,"“I’m quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads.",1656
6007,I know Matthew gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady’s jewels.”,1656
6008, CHAPTER XXXIV.,1658
6009,A Queen’s Girl,1658
6010," THE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Anne was getting ready to go to Queen’s, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be talked over and arranged.",1659
6011,"Anne’s outfit was ample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested.",1659
6012,More--one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material.,1659
6013,"“Anne, here’s something for a nice light dress for you.",1660
6014,"I don’t suppose you really need it; you’ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe you’d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that.",1660
6015,"I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got ‘evening dresses,’ as they call them, and I don’t mean you shall be behind them.",1660
6016,"I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town last week, and we’ll get Emily Gillis to make it for you.",1660
6017,"Emily has got taste, and her fits aren’t to be equaled.”",1660
6018,"“Oh, Marilla, it’s just lovely,” said Anne.",1661
6019,“Thank you so much.,1661
6020,I don’t believe you ought to be so kind to me--it’s making it harder every day for me to go away.”,1661
6021,The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily’s taste permitted.,1662
6022,"Anne put it on one evening for Matthew’s and Marilla’s benefit, and recited “The Maiden’s Vow” for them in the kitchen.",1662
6023,"As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes.",1662
6024,Something in the memory brought tears to Marilla’s own eyes.,1662
6025,"“I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,” said Anne gaily stooping over Marilla’s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady’s cheek.",1663
6026,"“Now, I call that a positive triumph.”",1663
6027,"“No, I wasn’t crying over your piece,” said Marilla, who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff.",1664
6028,"“I just couldn’t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne.",1664
6029,"And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways.",1664
6030,You’ve grown up now and you’re going away; and you look so tall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if you didn’t belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.”,1664
6031,"“Marilla!” Anne sat down on Marilla’s gingham lap, took Marilla’s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla’s eyes.",1665
6032,“I’m not a bit changed--not really.,1665
6033,I’m only just pruned down and branched out.,1665
6034,The real _me_--back here--is just the same.,1665
6035,"It won’t make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life.”",1665
6036,"Anne laid her fresh young cheek against Marilla’s faded one, and reached out a hand to pat Matthew’s shoulder.",1666
6037,"Marilla would have given much just then to have possessed Anne’s power of putting her feelings into words; but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing that she need never let her go.",1666
6038,"Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors.",1667
6039,Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.,1667
6040,"“Well now, I guess she ain’t been much spoiled,” he muttered, proudly.",1668
6041,“I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.,1668
6042,"She’s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the rest.",1668
6043,"She’s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake than what Mrs. Spencer made--if it _was_ luck.",1668
6044,I don’t believe it was any such thing.,1668
6045,"It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I reckon.”",1668
6046,The day finally came when Anne must go to town.,1669
6047,"She and Matthew drove in one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Diana and an untearful practical one--on Marilla’s side at least--with Marilla.",1669
6048,"But when Anne had gone Diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Marilla plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache--the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears.",1669
6049,"But that night, when Marilla went to bed, acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.",1669
6050,Anne and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the Academy.,1670
6051,"That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes.",1670
6052,Anne intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Stacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same.,1670
6053,"This meant getting a First Class teacher’s license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant much more and harder work.",1670
6054,"Jane, Ruby, Josie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.",1670
6055,"Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion she did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.",1670
6056,"Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old rivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking.",1670
6057,"“I wouldn’t feel comfortable without it,” she thought.",1671
6058,“Gilbert looks awfully determined.,1671
6059,"I suppose he’s making up his mind, here and now, to win the medal.",1671
6060,What a splendid chin he has!,1671
6061,I never noticed it before.,1671
6062,"I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too.",1671
6063,"I suppose I won’t feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted, though.",1671
6064,I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.,1671
6065,It’s really an interesting speculation.,1671
6066,"Of course I promised Diana that no Queen’s girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear to me as she is; but I’ve lots of second-best affections to bestow.",1671
6067,I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.,1671
6068,"She looks vivid and red-rosy; there’s that pale, fair one gazing out of the window.",1671
6069,"She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams.",1671
6070,"I’d like to know them both--know them well--well enough to walk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames.",1671
6071,"But just now I don’t know them and they don’t know me, and probably don’t want to know me particularly.",1671
6072,"Oh, it’s lonesome!”",1671
6073,It was lonesomer still when Anne found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight.,1672
6074,"She was not to board with the other girls, who all had relatives in town to take pity on them.",1672
6075,"Miss Josephine Barry would have liked to board her, but Beechwood was so far from the Academy that it was out of the question; so Miss Barry hunted up a boarding-house, assuring Matthew and Marilla that it was the very place for Anne.",1672
6076,"“The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman,” explained Miss Barry.",1673
6077,"“Her husband was a British officer, and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes.",1673
6078,Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons under her roof.,1673
6079,"The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in a quiet neighborhood.”",1673
6080,"All this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did not materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her.",1674
6081,"She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its dull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty bookcase; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in the garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a vast starry sky, and the light from Diana’s window shining out through the gap in the trees.",1674
6082,"Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that outside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger faces.",1674
6083,"She knew that she was going to cry, and fought against it.",1674
6084,“I _won’t_ cry.,1675
6085,It’s silly--and weak--there’s the third tear splashing down by my nose.,1675
6086,There are more coming!,1675
6087,I must think of something funny to stop them.,1675
6088,"But there’s nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I’m going home next Friday, but that seems a hundred years away.",1675
6089,"Oh, Matthew is nearly home by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for him--six--seven--eight--oh, there’s no use in counting them!",1675
6090,They’re coming in a flood presently.,1675
6091,I can’t cheer up--I don’t _want_ to cheer up.,1675
6092,It’s nicer to be miserable!”,1675
6093,"The flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not Josie Pye appeared at that moment.",1676
6094,In the joy of seeing a familiar face Anne forgot that there had never been much love lost between her and Josie.,1676
6095,As a part of Avonlea life even a Pye was welcome.,1676
6096,"“I’m so glad you came up,” Anne said sincerely.",1677
6097,"“You’ve been crying,” remarked Josie, with aggravating pity.",1678
6098,“I suppose you’re homesick--some people have so little self-control in that respect.,1678
6099,"I’ve no intention of being homesick, I can tell you.",1678
6100,Town’s too jolly after that poky old Avonlea.,1678
6101,I wonder how I ever existed there so long.,1678
6102,"You shouldn’t cry, Anne; it isn’t becoming, for your nose and eyes get red, and then you seem _all_ red.",1678
6103,I’d a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today.,1678
6104,Our French professor is simply a duck.,1678
6105,His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart.,1678
6106,"Have you anything eatable around, Anne?",1678
6107,I’m literally starving.,1678
6108,"Ah, I guessed likely Marilla ‘d load you up with cake.",1678
6109,That’s why I called round.,1678
6110,Otherwise I’d have gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley.,1678
6111,"He boards same place as I do, and he’s a sport.",1678
6112,"He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was.",1678
6113,"I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you’d been before that.”",1678
6114,"Anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more satisfactory than Josie Pye’s companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared, each with an inch of Queen’s color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned proudly to her coat.",1679
6115,As Josie was not “speaking” to Jane just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness.,1679
6116,"“Well,” said Jane with a sigh, “I feel as if I’d lived many moons since the morning.",1680
6117,I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow.,1680
6118,But I simply couldn’t settle down to study tonight.,1680
6119,"Anne, methinks I see the traces of tears.",1680
6120,If you’ve been crying _do_ own up.,1680
6121,"It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along.",1680
6122,"I don’t mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too.",1680
6123,Cake?,1680
6124,"You’ll give me a teeny piece, won’t you?",1680
6125,Thank you.,1680
6126,It has the real Avonlea flavor.”,1680
6127,"Ruby, perceiving the Queen’s calendar lying on the table, wanted to know if Anne meant to try for the gold medal.",1681
6128,Anne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.,1682
6129,"“Oh, that reminds me,” said Josie, “Queen’s is to get one of the Avery scholarships after all.",1683
6130,The word came today.,1683
6131,"Frank Stockley told me--his uncle is one of the board of governors, you know.",1683
6132,It will be announced in the Academy tomorrow.”,1683
6133,An Avery scholarship!,1684
6134,"Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic.",1684
6135,"Before Josie had told the news Anne’s highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teacher’s provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and perhaps the medal!",1684
6136,"But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning the Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and graduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie’s words had died away.",1684
6137,"For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt that here her foot was on native heath.",1684
6138,"A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces, according to their respective standings.",1685
6139,"There had been much doubt whether one would be allotted to Queen’s, but the matter was settled at last, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College.",1685
6140,No wonder that Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!,1685
6141,"“I’ll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,” she resolved.",1686
6142,“Wouldn’t Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.?,1686
6143,"Oh, it’s delightful to have ambitions.",1686
6144,I’m so glad I have such a lot.,1686
6145,And there never seems to be any end to them--that’s the best of it.,1686
6146,Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still.,1686
6147,It does make life so interesting.”,1686
6148, CHAPTER XXXV.,1688
6149,The Winter at Queen’s,1688
6150," ANNE’S homesickness wore off, greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home.",1689
6151,As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to Carmody on the new branch railway every Friday night.,1689
6152,Diana and several other Avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked over to Avonlea in a merry party.,1689
6153,"Anne thought those Friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air, with the homelights of Avonlea twinkling beyond, were the best and dearest hours in the whole week.",1689
6154,Gilbert Blythe nearly always walked with Ruby Gillis and carried her satchel for her.,1690
6155,"Ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking herself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had to take it down when she went home.",1690
6156,"She had large, bright-blue eyes, a brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure.",1690
6157,"She laughed a great deal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of life frankly.",1690
6158,"“But I shouldn’t think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like,”  whispered Jane to Anne.",1691
6159,"Anne did not think so either, but she would not have said so for the Avery scholarship.",1691
6160,"She could not help thinking, too, that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as Gilbert to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions.",1691
6161,"Gilbert had ambitions, she knew, and Ruby Gillis did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed.",1691
6162,There was no silly sentiment in Anne’s ideas concerning Gilbert.,1692
6163,"Boys were to her, when she thought about them at all, merely possible good comrades.",1692
6164,If she and Gilbert had been friends she would not have cared how many other friends he had nor with whom he walked.,1692
6165,She had a genius for friendship; girl friends she had in plenty; but she had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out one’s conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison.,1692
6166,Not that Anne could have put her feelings on the matter into just such clear definition.,1692
6167,"But she thought that if Gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein.",1692
6168,"Gilbert was a clever young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it.",1692
6169,Ruby Gillis told Jane Andrews that she didn’t understand half the things Gilbert Blythe said; he talked just like Anne Shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part she didn’t think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of thing when you didn’t have to.,1692
6170,"Frank Stockley had lots more dash and go, but then he wasn’t half as good-looking as Gilbert and she really couldn’t decide which she liked best!",1692
6171,"In the Academy Anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about her, thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself.",1693
6172,"With the “rose-red” girl, Stella Maynard, and the “dream girl,” Priscilla Grant, she soon became intimate, finding the latter pale spiritual-looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun, while the vivid, black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies, as aerial and rainbow-like as Anne’s own.",1693
6173,After the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home on Fridays and settled down to hard work.,1694
6174,By this time all the Queen’s scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality.,1694
6175,Certain facts had become generally accepted.,1694
6176,"It was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three--Gilbert Blythe, Anne Shirley, and Lewis Wilson; the Avery scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible winner.",1694
6177,"The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat.",1694
6178,"Ruby Gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy; in the Second Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with small but critical minority in favor of Anne Shirley.",1695
6179,"Ethel Marr was admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair-dressing, and Jane Andrews--plain, plodding, conscientious Jane--carried off the honors in the domestic science course.",1695
6180,Even Josie Pye attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in attendance at Queen’s.,1695
6181,So it may be fairly stated that Miss Stacy’s old pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course.,1695
6182,Anne worked hard and steadily.,1696
6183,"Her rivalry with Gilbert was as intense as it had ever been in Avonlea school, although it was not known in the class at large, but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it.",1696
6184,"Anne no longer wished to win for the sake of defeating Gilbert; rather, for the proud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman.",1696
6185,"It would be worth while to win, but she no longer thought life would be insupportable if she did not.",1696
6186,In spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times.,1697
6187,Anne spent many of her spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her Sunday dinners there and went to church with Miss Barry.,1697
6188,"The latter was, as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated.",1697
6189,"But she never sharpened the latter on Anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady.",1697
6190,"“That Anne-girl improves all the time,” she said.",1698
6191,“I get tired of other girls--there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them.,1698
6192,Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts.,1698
6193,"I don’t know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love them.",1698
6194,It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them.”,1698
6195,"Then, almost before anybody realized it, spring had come; out in Avonlea the Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow-wreaths lingered; and the “mist of green” was on the woods and in the valleys.",1699
6196,But in Charlottetown harassed Queen’s students thought and talked only of examinations.,1699
6197,"“It doesn’t seem possible that the term is nearly over,” said Anne.",1700
6198,"“Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter of studies and classes.",1700
6199,"And here we are, with the exams looming up next week.",1700
6200,"Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but when I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they don’t seem half so important.”",1700
6201,"Jane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view of it.",1701
6202,To them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed--far more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes.,1701
6203,"It was all very well for Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her moments of belittling them, but when your whole future depended on them--as the girls truly thought theirs did--you could not regard them philosophically.",1701
6204,"“I’ve lost seven pounds in the last two weeks,” sighed Jane.",1702
6205,“It’s no use to say don’t worry.,1702
6206,I _will_ worry.,1702
6207,Worrying helps you some--it seems as if you were doing something when you’re worrying.,1702
6208,It would be dreadful if I failed to get my license after going to Queen’s all winter and spending so much money.”,1702
6209,"“_I_ don’t care,” said Josie Pye.",1703
6210,“If I don’t pass this year I’m coming back next.,1703
6211,My father can afford to send me.,1703
6212,"Anne, Frank Stockley says that Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe was sure to get the medal and that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery scholarship.”",1703
6213,"“That may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,” laughed Anne, “but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers’ Lane, it’s not a great deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not.",1704
6214,"I’ve done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the ‘joy of the strife.’ Next to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing.",1704
6215,"Girls, don’t talk about exams!",1704
6216,Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back of Avonlea.”,1704
6217,"“What are you going to wear for commencement, Jane?” asked Ruby practically.",1705
6218,Jane and Josie both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy of fashions.,1706
6219,"But Anne, with her elbows on the window sill, her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions, looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth’s own optimism.",1706
6220,All the Beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years--each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet.,1706
6221, CHAPTER XXXVI.,1708
6222,The Glory and the Dream,1708
6223," ON the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at Queen’s, Anne and Jane walked down the street together.",1709
6224,Jane was smiling and happy; examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least; further considerations troubled Jane not at all; she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon.,1709
6225,"For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.",1709
6226,Anne was pale and quiet; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who the Avery.,1709
6227,"Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.",1709
6228,"“Of course you’ll win one of them anyhow,” said Jane, who couldn’t understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise.",1710
6229,"“I have not hope of the Avery,” said Anne.",1711
6230,“Everybody says Emily Clay will win it.,1711
6231,And I’m not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody.,1711
6232,I haven’t the moral courage.,1711
6233,I’m going straight to the girls’ dressing room.,1711
6234,"You must read the announcements and then come and tell me, Jane.",1711
6235,And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible.,1711
6236,"If I have failed just say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _don’t_ sympathize with me.",1711
6237,"Promise me this, Jane.”",1711
6238,"Jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for such a promise.",1712
6239,"When they went up the entrance steps of Queen’s they found the hall full of boys who were carrying Gilbert Blythe around on their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, “Hurrah for Blythe, Medalist!”",1712
6240,For a moment Anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment.,1713
6241,So she had failed and Gilbert had won!,1713
6242,"Well, Matthew would be sorry--he had been so sure she would win.",1713
6243,And then!,1714
6244,Somebody called out:,1715
6245,"“Three cheers for Miss Shirley, winner of the Avery!”",1716
6246,"“Oh, Anne,” gasped Jane, as they fled to the girls’ dressing room amid hearty cheers.",1717
6247,"“Oh, Anne I’m so proud!",1717
6248,Isn’t it splendid?”,1717
6249,"And then the girls were around them and Anne was the center of a laughing, congratulating group.",1718
6250,Her shoulders were thumped and her hands shaken vigorously.,1718
6251,She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she managed to whisper to Jane:,1718
6252,"“Oh, won’t Matthew and Marilla be pleased!",1719
6253,I must write the news home right away.”,1719
6254,Commencement was the next important happening.,1720
6255,The exercises were held in the big assembly hall of the Academy.,1720
6256,"Addresses were given, essays read, songs sung, the public award of diplomas, prizes and medals made.",1720
6257,"Matthew and Marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student on the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed cheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as the Avery winner.",1721
6258,"“Reckon you’re glad we kept her, Marilla?” whispered Matthew, speaking for the first time since he had entered the hall, when Anne had finished her essay.",1722
6259,"“It’s not the first time I’ve been glad,” retorted Marilla.",1723
6260,"“You do like to rub things in, Matthew Cuthbert.”",1723
6261,"Miss Barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked Marilla in the back with her parasol.",1724
6262,“Aren’t you proud of that Anne-girl?,1725
6263,"I am,” she said.",1725
6264,Anne went home to Avonlea with Matthew and Marilla that evening.,1726
6265,She had not been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another day.,1726
6266,The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.,1726
6267,Diana was at Green Gables to meet her.,1726
6268,"In her own white room, where Marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness.",1726
6269,"“Oh, Diana, it’s so good to be back again.",1727
6270,It’s so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky--and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen.,1727
6271,Isn’t the breath of the mint delicious?,1727
6272,"And that tea rose--why, it’s a song and a hope and a prayer all in one.",1727
6273,"And it’s _good_ to see you again, Diana!”",1727
6274,"“I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me,” said Diana reproachfully.",1728
6275,“Josie Pye told me you did.,1728
6276,Josie said you were _infatuated_ with her.”,1728
6277,Anne laughed and pelted Diana with the faded “June lilies” of her bouquet.,1729
6278,"“Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one, Diana,” she said.",1730
6279,“I love you more than ever--and I’ve so many things to tell you.,1730
6280,But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you.,1730
6281,"I’m tired, I think--tired of being studious and ambitious.",1730
6282,"I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.”",1730
6283,"“You’ve done splendidly, Anne.",1731
6284,I suppose you won’t be teaching now that you’ve won the Avery?”,1731
6285,“No.,1732
6286,I’m going to Redmond in September.,1732
6287,Doesn’t it seem wonderful?,1732
6288,"I’ll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious, golden months of vacation.",1732
6289,Jane and Ruby are going to teach.,1732
6290,Isn’t it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and Josie Pye?”,1732
6291,"“The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already,” said Diana.",1733
6292,"“Gilbert Blythe is going to teach, too.",1733
6293,He has to.,1733
6294,"His father can’t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means to earn his own way through.",1733
6295,I expect he’ll get the school here if Miss Ames decides to leave.”,1733
6296,Anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise.,1734
6297,She had not known this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also.,1734
6298,What would she do without their inspiring rivalry?,1734
6299,"Would not work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat without her friend the enemy?",1734
6300,The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck Anne that Matthew was not looking well.,1735
6301,Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before.,1735
6302,"“Marilla,” she said hesitatingly when he had gone out, “is Matthew quite well?”",1736
6303,"“No, he isn’t,” said Marilla in a troubled tone.",1737
6304,“He’s had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he won’t spare himself a mite.,1737
6305,"I’ve been real worried about him, but he’s some better this while back and we’ve got a good hired man, so I’m hoping he’ll kind of rest and pick up.",1737
6306,Maybe he will now you’re home.,1737
6307,You always cheer him up.”,1737
6308,Anne leaned across the table and took Marilla’s face in her hands.,1738
6309,"“You are not looking as well yourself as I’d like to see you, Marilla.",1739
6310,You look tired.,1739
6311,I’m afraid you’ve been working too hard.,1739
6312,"You must take a rest, now that I’m home.",1739
6313,"I’m just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will be your turn to be lazy while I do the work.”",1739
6314,Marilla smiled affectionately at her girl.,1740
6315,“It’s not the work--it’s my head.,1741
6316,I’ve got a pain so often now--behind my eyes.,1741
6317,"Doctor Spencer’s been fussing with glasses, but they don’t do me any good.",1741
6318,There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the last of June and the doctor says I must see him.,1741
6319,I guess I’ll have to.,1741
6320,I can’t read or sew with any comfort now.,1741
6321,"Well, Anne, you’ve done real well at Queen’s I must say.",1741
6322,"To take First Class License in one year and win the Avery scholarship--well, well, Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before a fall and she doesn’t believe in the higher education of women at all; she says it unfits them for woman’s true sphere.",1741
6323,I don’t believe a word of it.,1741
6324,"Speaking of Rachel reminds me--did you hear anything about the Abbey Bank lately, Anne?”",1741
6325,"“I heard it was shaky,” answered Anne.",1742
6326,“Why?”,1742
6327,“That is what Rachel said.,1743
6328,She was up here one day last week and said there was some talk about it.,1743
6329,Matthew felt real worried.,1743
6330,All we have saved is in that bank--every penny.,1743
6331,"I wanted Matthew to put it in the Savings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of father’s and he’d always banked with him.",1743
6332,Matthew said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody.”,1743
6333,"“I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,” said Anne.",1744
6334,“He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the institution.”,1744
6335,"“Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money right out and he said he’d think of it.",1745
6336,But Mr. Russell told him yesterday that the bank was all right.”,1745
6337,Anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world.,1746
6338,"She never forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free from shadow and so lavish of blossom.",1746
6339,"Anne spent some of its rich hours in the orchard; she went to the Dryad’s Bubble and Willowmere and Violet Vale; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with Mrs. Allan; and finally in the evening she went with Matthew for the cows, through Lovers’ Lane to the back pasture.",1746
6340,The woods were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west.,1746
6341,"Matthew walked slowly with bent head; Anne, tall and erect, suited her springing step to his.",1746
6342,"“You’ve been working too hard today, Matthew,” she said reproachfully.",1747
6343,“Why won’t you take things easier?”,1747
6344,"“Well now, I can’t seem to,” said Matthew, as he opened the yard gate to let the cows through.",1748
6345,"“It’s only that I’m getting old, Anne, and keep forgetting it.",1748
6346,"Well, well, I’ve always worked pretty hard and I’d rather drop in harness.”",1748
6347,"“If I had been the boy you sent for,” said Anne wistfully, “I’d be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways.",1749
6348,"I could find it in my heart to wish I had been, just for that.”",1749
6349,"“Well now, I’d rather have you than a dozen boys, Anne,” said Matthew patting her hand.",1750
6350,“Just mind you that--rather than a dozen boys.,1750
6351,"Well now, I guess it wasn’t a boy that took the Avery scholarship, was it?",1750
6352,It was a girl--my girl--my girl that I’m proud of.”,1750
6353,He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard.,1751
6354,"Anne took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window, thinking of the past and dreaming of the future.",1751
6355,Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine; the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope.,1751
6356,"Anne always remembered the silvery, peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night.",1751
6357,"It was the last night before sorrow touched her life; and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold, sanctifying touch has been laid upon it.",1751
6358, CHAPTER XXXVII.,1753
6359,The Reaper Whose Name Is Death,1753
6360, MATTHEW--Matthew--what is the matter?,1754
6361,"Matthew, are you sick?”",1754
6362,"It was Marilla who spoke, alarm in every jerky word.",1755
6363,"Anne came through the hall, her hands full of white narcissus,--it was long before Anne could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,--in time to hear her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray.",1755
6364,Anne dropped her flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as Marilla.,1755
6365,They were both too late; before they could reach him Matthew had fallen across the threshold.,1755
6366,"“He’s fainted,” gasped Marilla.",1756
6367,"“Anne, run for Martin--quick, quick!",1756
6368,He’s at the barn.”,1756
6369,"Martin, the hired man, who had just driven home from the post office, started at once for the doctor, calling at Orchard Slope on his way to send Mr. and Mrs. Barry over.",1757
6370,"Mrs. Lynde, who was there on an errand, came too.",1757
6371,They found Anne and Marilla distractedly trying to restore Matthew to consciousness.,1757
6372,"Mrs. Lynde pushed them gently aside, tried his pulse, and then laid her ear over his heart.",1758
6373,She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears came into her eyes.,1758
6374,"“Oh, Marilla,” she said gravely.",1759
6375,“I don’t think--we can do anything for him.”,1759
6376,“Mrs.,1760
6377,"Lynde, you don’t think--you can’t think Matthew is--is--” Anne could not say the dreadful word; she turned sick and pallid.",1760
6378,"“Child, yes, I’m afraid of it.",1761
6379,Look at his face.,1761
6380,When you’ve seen that look as often as I have you’ll know what it means.”,1761
6381,Anne looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great Presence.,1762
6382,"When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock.",1763
6383,The secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper Matthew had held and which Martin had brought from the office that morning.,1763
6384,It contained an account of the failure of the Abbey Bank.,1763
6385,"The news spread quickly through Avonlea, and all day friends and neighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and living.",1764
6386,"For the first time shy, quiet Matthew Cuthbert was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned.",1764
6387,When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was hushed and tranquil.,1765
6388,"In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams.",1765
6389,"There were flowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which Matthew had always had a secret, wordless love.",1765
6390,"Anne had gathered them and brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white face.",1765
6391,It was the last thing she could do for him.,1765
6392,The Barrys and Mrs. Lynde stayed with them that night.,1766
6393,"Diana, going to the east gable, where Anne was standing at her window, said gently:",1766
6394,"“Anne dear, would you like to have me sleep with you tonight?”",1767
6395,"“Thank you, Diana.” Anne looked earnestly into her friend’s face.",1768
6396,“I think you won’t misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone.,1768
6397,I’m not afraid.,1768
6398,I haven’t been alone one minute since it happened--and I want to be.,1768
6399,I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it.,1768
6400,I can’t realize it.,1768
6401,Half the time it seems to me that Matthew can’t be dead; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I’ve had this horrible dull ache ever since.”,1768
6402,Diana did not quite understand.,1769
6403,"Marilla’s impassioned grief, breaking all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush, she could comprehend better than Anne’s tearless agony.",1769
6404,"But she went away kindly, leaving Anne alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow.",1769
6405,Anne hoped that the tears would come in solitude.,1770
6406,"It seemed to her a terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for Matthew, whom she had loved so much and who had been so kind to her, Matthew who had walked with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his brow.",1770
6407,"But no tears came at first, even when she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed, looking up to the stars beyond the hills--no tears, only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep, worn out with the day’s pain and excitement.",1770
6408,"In the night she awakened, with the stillness and the darkness about her, and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow.",1771
6409,"She could see Matthew’s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening--she could hear his voice saying, “My girl--my girl that I’m proud of.” Then the tears came and Anne wept her heart out.",1771
6410,Marilla heard her and crept in to comfort her.,1771
6411,"“There--there--don’t cry so, dearie.",1772
6412,It can’t bring him back.,1772
6413,It--it--isn’t right to cry so.,1772
6414,"I knew that today, but I couldn’t help it then.",1772
6415,"He’d always been such a good, kind brother to me--but God knows best.”",1772
6416,"“Oh, just let me cry, Marilla,” sobbed Anne.",1773
6417,“The tears don’t hurt me like that ache did.,1773
6418,Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me--so.,1773
6419,"I couldn’t have Diana stay, she’s good and kind and sweet--but it’s not her sorrow--she’s outside of it and she couldn’t come close enough to my heart to help me.",1773
6420,It’s our sorrow--yours and mine.,1773
6421,"Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?”",1773
6422,"“We’ve got each other, Anne.",1774
6423,I don’t know what I’d do if you weren’t here--if you’d never come.,1774
6424,"Oh, Anne, I know I’ve been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe--but you mustn’t think I didn’t love you as well as Matthew did, for all that.",1774
6425,I want to tell you now when I can.,1774
6426,"It’s never been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this it’s easier.",1774
6427,I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you’ve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables.”,1774
6428,"Two days afterwards they carried Matthew Cuthbert over his homestead threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the trees he had planted; and then Avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before, although always with the aching sense of “loss in all familiar things.”  Anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that they _could_ go on in the old way without Matthew.",1775
6429,"She felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them--that Diana’s visits were pleasant to her and that Diana’s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices.",1775
6430,"“It seems like disloyalty to Matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in these things now that he has gone,” she said wistfully to Mrs. Allan one evening when they were together in the manse garden.",1776
6431,"“I miss him so much--all the time--and yet, Mrs. Allan, the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all.",1776
6432,Today Diana said something funny and I found myself laughing.,1776
6433,I thought when it happened I could never laugh again.,1776
6434,And it somehow seems as if I oughtn’t to.”,1776
6435,"“When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,” said Mrs. Allan gently.",1777
6436,“He is just away now; and he likes to know it just the same.,1777
6437,I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us.,1777
6438,But I can understand your feeling.,1777
6439,I think we all experience the same thing.,1777
6440,"We resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us, and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us.”",1777
6441,"“I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew’s grave this afternoon,” said Anne dreamily.",1778
6442,“I took a slip of the little white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago; Matthew always liked those roses the best--they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems.,1778
6443,It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave--as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him.,1778
6444,I hope he has roses like them in heaven.,1778
6445,Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him.,1778
6446,I must go home now.,1778
6447,Marilla is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight.”,1778
6448,"“She will be lonelier still, I fear, when you go away again to college,”  said Mrs. Allan.",1779
6449,Anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to Green Gables.,1780
6450,Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down beside her.,1780
6451,"The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.",1780
6452,Anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair.,1781
6453,"She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial benediction, above her every time she moved.",1781
6454,"“Doctor Spencer was here while you were away,” Marilla said.",1782
6455,“He says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must go in and have my eyes examined.,1782
6456,I suppose I’d better go and have it over.,1782
6457,I’ll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to suit my eyes.,1782
6458,"You won’t mind staying here alone while I’m away, will you?",1782
6459,Martin will have to drive me in and there’s ironing and baking to do.”,1782
6460,“I shall be all right.,1783
6461,Diana will come over for company for me.,1783
6462,I shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn’t fear that I’ll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.”,1783
6463,Marilla laughed.,1784
6464,"“What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne.",1785
6465,You were always getting into scrapes.,1785
6466,I did use to think you were possessed.,1785
6467,Do you mind the time you dyed your hair?”,1785
6468,"“Yes, indeed.",1786
6469,"I shall never forget it,” smiled Anne, touching the heavy braid of hair that was wound about her shapely head.",1786
6470,"“I laugh a little now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I don’t laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then.",1786
6471,I did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles.,1786
6472,My freckles are really gone; and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie Pye.,1786
6473,"She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it.",1786
6474,"Marilla, I’ve almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye.",1786
6475,"I’ve made what I would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won’t _be_ liked.”",1786
6476,"“Josie is a Pye,” said Marilla sharply, “so she can’t help being disagreeable.",1787
6477,"I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society, but I must say I don’t know what it is any more than I know the use of thistles.",1787
6478,Is Josie going to teach?”,1787
6479,"“No, she is going back to Queen’s next year.",1788
6480,So are Moody Spurgeon and Charlie Sloane.,1788
6481,Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got schools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.”,1788
6482,"“Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn’t he?”",1789
6483,“Yes”--briefly.,1790
6484,"“What a nice-looking fellow he is,” said Marilla absently.",1791
6485,“I saw him in church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly.,1791
6486,He looks a lot like his father did at the same age.,1791
6487,John Blythe was a nice boy.,1791
6488,"We used to be real good friends, he and I.",1791
6489,People called him my beau.”,1791
6490,Anne looked up with swift interest.,1792
6491,"“Oh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn’t you--”",1793
6492,“We had a quarrel.,1794
6493,I wouldn’t forgive him when he asked me to.,1794
6494,"I meant to, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him first.",1794
6495,He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent.,1794
6496,But I always felt--rather sorry.,1794
6497,I’ve always kind of wished I’d forgiven him when I had the chance.”,1794
6498,"“So you’ve had a bit of romance in your life, too,” said Anne softly.",1795
6499,"“Yes, I suppose you might call it that.",1796
6500,"You wouldn’t think so to look at me, would you?",1796
6501,But you never can tell about people from their outsides.,1796
6502,Everybody has forgot about me and John.,1796
6503,I’d forgotten myself.,1796
6504,But it all came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.”,1796
6505, CHAPTER XXXVIII.,1798
6506,The Bend in the Road,1798
6507, MARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening.,1799
6508,"Anne had gone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in the kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.",1799
6509,Something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne’s heart.,1799
6510,She had never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.,1799
6511,"“Are you very tired, Marilla?”",1800
6512,"“Yes--no--I don’t know,” said Marilla wearily, looking up.",1801
6513,“I suppose I am tired but I haven’t thought about it.,1801
6514,It’s not that.”,1801
6515,“Did you see the oculist?,1802
6516,What did he say?” asked Anne anxiously.,1802
6517,"“Yes, I saw him.",1803
6518,He examined my eyes.,1803
6519,"He says that if I give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes, and if I’m careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he’s given me he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.",1803
6520,But if I don’t he says I’ll certainly be stone-blind in six months.,1803
6521,Blind!,1803
6522,"Anne, just think of it!”",1803
6523,"For a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was silent.",1804
6524,It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak.,1804
6525,"Then she said bravely, but with a catch in her voice:",1804
6526,"“Marilla, _don’t_ think of it.",1805
6527,You know he has given you hope.,1805
6528,If you are careful you won’t lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing.”,1805
6529,"“I don’t call it much hope,” said Marilla bitterly.",1806
6530,“What am I to live for if I can’t read or sew or do anything like that?,1806
6531,I might as well be blind--or dead.,1806
6532,"And as for crying, I can’t help that when I get lonesome.",1806
6533,"But there, it’s no good talking about it.",1806
6534,If you’ll get me a cup of tea I’ll be thankful.,1806
6535,I’m about done out.,1806
6536,"Don’t say anything about this to any one for a spell yet, anyway.",1806
6537,I can’t bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.”,1806
6538,When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed.,1807
6539,Then Anne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart.,1807
6540,How sadly things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!,1807
6541,Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise.,1807
6542,"Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.",1807
6543,She had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a friend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.,1807
6544,One afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front yard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by sight as Sadler from Carmody.,1808
6545,Anne wondered what he could have been saying to bring that look to Marilla’s face.,1808
6546,"“What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?”",1809
6547,Marilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne.,1810
6548,There were tears in her eyes in defiance of the oculist’s prohibition and her voice broke as she said:,1810
6549,“He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it.”,1811
6550,“Buy it!,1812
6551,Buy Green Gables?” Anne wondered if she had heard aright.,1812
6552,"“Oh, Marilla, you don’t mean to sell Green Gables!”",1812
6553,"“Anne, I don’t know what else is to be done.",1813
6554,I’ve thought it all over.,1813
6555,"If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage, with a good hired man.",1813
6556,But as it is I can’t.,1813
6557,I may lose my sight altogether; and anyway I’ll not be fit to run things.,1813
6558,"Oh, I never thought I’d live to see the day when I’d have to sell my home.",1813
6559,"But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till nobody would want to buy it.",1813
6560,Every cent of our money went in that bank; and there’s some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay.,1813
6561,Mrs. Lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose.,1813
6562,It won’t bring much--it’s small and the buildings are old.,1813
6563,But it’ll be enough for me to live on I reckon.,1813
6564,"I’m thankful you’re provided for with that scholarship, Anne.",1813
6565,"I’m sorry you won’t have a home to come to in your vacations, that’s all, but I suppose you’ll manage somehow.”",1813
6566,Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.,1814
6567,"“You mustn’t sell Green Gables,” said Anne resolutely.",1815
6568,"“Oh, Anne, I wish I didn’t have to.",1816
6569,But you can see for yourself.,1816
6570,I can’t stay here alone.,1816
6571,I’d go crazy with trouble and loneliness.,1816
6572,And my sight would go--I know it would.”,1816
6573,"“You won’t have to stay here alone, Marilla.",1817
6574,I’ll be with you.,1817
6575,I’m not going to Redmond.”,1817
6576,“Not going to Redmond!” Marilla lifted her worn face from her hands and looked at Anne.,1818
6577,"“Why, what do you mean?”",1818
6578,“Just what I say.,1819
6579,I’m not going to take the scholarship.,1819
6580,I decided so the night after you came home from town.,1819
6581,"You surely don’t think I could leave you alone in your trouble, Marilla, after all you’ve done for me.",1819
6582,I’ve been thinking and planning.,1819
6583,Let me tell you my plans.,1819
6584,Mr. Barry wants to rent the farm for next year.,1819
6585,So you won’t have any bother over that.,1819
6586,And I’m going to teach.,1819
6587,I’ve applied for the school here--but I don’t expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to Gilbert Blythe.,1819
6588,But I can have the Carmody school--Mr. Blair told me so last night at the store.,1819
6589,Of course that won’t be quite as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school.,1819
6590,"But I can board home and drive myself over to Carmody and back, in the warm weather at least.",1819
6591,And even in winter I can come home Fridays.,1819
6592,We’ll keep a horse for that.,1819
6593,"Oh, I have it all planned out, Marilla.",1819
6594,And I’ll read to you and keep you cheered up.,1819
6595,You sha’n’t be dull or lonesome.,1819
6596,"And we’ll be real cozy and happy here together, you and I.”",1819
6597,Marilla had listened like a woman in a dream.,1820
6598,"“Oh, Anne, I could get on real well if you were here, I know.",1821
6599,But I can’t let you sacrifice yourself so for me.,1821
6600,It would be terrible.”,1821
6601,“Nonsense!” Anne laughed merrily.,1822
6602,“There is no sacrifice.,1822
6603,Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables--nothing could hurt me more.,1822
6604,We must keep the dear old place.,1822
6605,"My mind is quite made up, Marilla.",1822
6606,I’m _not_ going to Redmond; and I _am_ going to stay here and teach.,1822
6607,Don’t you worry about me a bit.”,1822
6608,“But your ambitions--and--”,1823
6609,“I’m just as ambitious as ever.,1824
6610,"Only, I’ve changed the object of my ambitions.",1824
6611,I’m going to be a good teacher--and I’m going to save your eyesight.,1824
6612,"Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself.",1824
6613,"Oh, I’ve dozens of plans, Marilla.",1824
6614,I’ve been thinking them out for a week.,1824
6615,"I shall give life here my best, and I believe it will give its best to me in return.",1824
6616,When I left Queen’s my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road.,1824
6617,I thought I could see along it for many a milestone.,1824
6618,Now there is a bend in it.,1824
6619,"I don’t know what lies around the bend, but I’m going to believe that the best does.",1824
6620,"It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla.",1824
6621,"I wonder how the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and soft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new beauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on.”",1824
6622,"“I don’t feel as if I ought to let you give it up,” said Marilla, referring to the scholarship.",1825
6623,“But you can’t prevent me.,1826
6624,"I’m sixteen and a half, ‘obstinate as a mule,’ as Mrs. Lynde once told me,” laughed Anne.",1826
6625,"“Oh, Marilla, don’t you go pitying me.",1826
6626,"I don’t like to be pitied, and there is no need for it.",1826
6627,I’m heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables.,1826
6628,Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it.”,1826
6629,"“You blessed girl!” said Marilla, yielding.",1827
6630,“I feel as if you’d given me new life.,1827
6631,"I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but I know I can’t, so I ain’t going to try.",1827
6632,"I’ll make it up to you though, Anne.”",1827
6633,When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal of discussion over it.,1828
6634,"Most of the good folks, not knowing about Marilla’s eyes, thought she was foolish.",1828
6635,Mrs. Allan did not.,1828
6636,She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girl’s eyes.,1828
6637,Neither did good Mrs. Lynde.,1828
6638,"She came up one evening and found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm, scented summer dusk.",1828
6639,They liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air.,1828
6640,"Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief.",1829
6641,“I declare I’m getting glad to sit down.,1830
6642,"I’ve been on my feet all day, and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round.",1830
6643,"It’s a great blessing not to be fat, Marilla.",1830
6644,I hope you appreciate it.,1830
6645,"Well, Anne, I hear you’ve given up your notion of going to college.",1830
6646,I was real glad to hear it.,1830
6647,You’ve got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with.,1830
6648,I don’t believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.”,1830
6649,"“But I’m going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,” said Anne laughing.",1831
6650,"“I’m going to take my Arts course right here at Green Gables, and study everything that I would at college.”",1831
6651,Mrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.,1832
6652,"“Anne Shirley, you’ll kill yourself.”",1833
6653,“Not a bit of it.,1834
6654,I shall thrive on it.,1834
6655,"Oh, I’m not going to overdo things.",1834
6656,"As ‘Josiah Allen’s wife,’ says, I shall be ‘mejum’.",1834
6657,"But I’ll have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I’ve no vocation for fancy work.",1834
6658,"I’m going to teach over at Carmody, you know.”",1834
6659,“I don’t know it.,1835
6660,I guess you’re going to teach right here in Avonlea.,1835
6661,The trustees have decided to give you the school.”,1835
6662,“Mrs.,1836
6663,"Lynde!” cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise.",1836
6664,"“Why, I thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!”",1836
6665,“So they did.,1837
6666,"But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night, you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested that they accept yours.",1837
6667,He said he was going to teach at White Sands.,1837
6668,"Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that’s what.",1837
6669,"Real self-sacrificing, too, for he’ll have his board to pay at White Sands, and everybody knows he’s got to earn his own way through college.",1837
6670,So the trustees decided to take you.,1837
6671,I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me.”,1837
6672,"“I don’t feel that I ought to take it,” murmured Anne.",1838
6673,“I mean--I don’t think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.”,1838
6674,“I guess you can’t prevent him now.,1839
6675,He’s signed papers with the White Sands trustees.,1839
6676,So it wouldn’t do him any good now if you were to refuse.,1839
6677,Of course you’ll take the school.,1839
6678,"You’ll get along all right, now that there are no Pyes going.",1839
6679,"Josie was the last of them, and a good thing she was, that’s what.",1839
6680,"There’s been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn’t their home.",1839
6681,Bless my heart!,1839
6682,What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean?”,1839
6683,"“Diana is signaling for me to go over,” laughed Anne.",1840
6684,“You know we keep up the old custom.,1840
6685,Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants.”,1840
6686,"Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood.",1841
6687,Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.,1841
6688,“There’s a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.”,1842
6689,"“There’s a good deal more of the woman about her in others,” retorted Marilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.",1843
6690,But crispness was no longer Marilla’s distinguishing characteristic.,1844
6691,As Mrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.,1844
6692,“Marilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_.,1845
6693,That’s what.”,1845
6694,Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on Matthew’s grave and water the Scotch rosebush.,1846
6695,"She lingered there until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place, with its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves.",1846
6696,When she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight--“a haunt of ancient peace.” There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover.,1846
6697,Home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees.,1846
6698,"Beyond lay the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur.",1846
6699,"The west was a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings.",1846
6700,"The beauty of it all thrilled Anne’s heart, and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.",1846
6701,"“Dear old world,” she murmured, “you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you.”",1847
6702,Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the Blythe homestead.,1848
6703,"It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he recognized Anne.",1848
6704,"He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed on in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.",1848
6705,"“Gilbert,” she said, with scarlet cheeks, “I want to thank you for giving up the school for me.",1849
6706,It was very good of you--and I want you to know that I appreciate it.”,1849
6707,Gilbert took the offered hand eagerly.,1850
6708,"“It wasn’t particularly good of me at all, Anne.",1851
6709,I was pleased to be able to do you some small service.,1851
6710,Are we going to be friends after this?,1851
6711,Have you really forgiven me my old fault?”,1851
6712,Anne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.,1852
6713,"“I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn’t know it.",1853
6714,What a stubborn little goose I was.,1853
6715,I’ve been--I may as well make a complete confession--I’ve been sorry ever since.”,1853
6716,"“We are going to be the best of friends,” said Gilbert, jubilantly.",1854
6717,"“We were born to be good friends, Anne.",1854
6718,You’ve thwarted destiny enough.,1854
6719,I know we can help each other in many ways.,1854
6720,"You are going to keep up your studies, aren’t you?",1854
6721,So am I.,1854
6722,"Come, I’m going to walk home with you.”",1854
6723,Marilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.,1855
6724,"“Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?”",1856
6725,"“Gilbert Blythe,” answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing.",1857
6726,“I met him on Barry’s hill.”,1857
6727,"“I didn’t think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you’d stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,” said Marilla with a dry smile.",1858
6728,“We haven’t been--we’ve been good enemies.,1859
6729,But we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future.,1859
6730,Were we really there half an hour?,1859
6731,It seemed just a few minutes.,1859
6732,"But, you see, we have five years’ lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.”",1859
6733,Anne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.,1860
6734,"The wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came up to her.",1860
6735,The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and Diana’s light gleamed through the old gap.,1860
6736,Anne’s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after coming home from Queen’s; but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.,1861
6737,The joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dreams.,1861
6738,And there was always the bend in the road!,1861
6739,"“‘God’s in his heaven, all’s right with the world,’” whispered Anne softly.",1862
