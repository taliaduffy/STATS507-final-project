1,"_To Mrs. Saville, England._",1
2,"St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.",2
3,You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied thecommencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evilforebodings.,3
4,"I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assuremy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the successof my undertaking.",3
5,"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets ofPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, whichbraces my nerves and fills me with delight.",4
6,Do you understand thisfeeling?,4
7,"This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towardswhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.",4
8,"Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more ferventand vivid.",4
9,I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat offrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as theregion of beauty and delight.,4
10,"There, Margaret, the sun is for evervisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing aperpetual splendour.",4
11,"There—for with your leave, my sister, I will putsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing inwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitableglobe.",4
12,"Its productions and features may be without example, as thephenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscoveredsolitudes.",4
13,What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?,4
14,Imay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and mayregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only thisvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.,4
15,"Ishall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the worldnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted bythe foot of man.",4
16,"These are my enticements, and they are sufficient toconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence thislaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a littleboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up hisnative river.",4
17,"But supposing all these conjectures to be false, youcannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on allmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the poleto those countries, to reach which at present so many months arerequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if atall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.",4
18,"These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began myletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates meto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind asa steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectualeye.",5
19,This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.,5
20,Ihave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which havebeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Oceanthrough the seas which surround the pole.,5
21,You may remember that ahistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed thewhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.,5
22,"My education was neglected,yet I was passionately fond of reading.",5
23,"These volumes were my studyday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret whichI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunctionhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.",5
24,"These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poetswhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.",6
25,I alsobecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where thenames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.,6
26,You are wellacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.,6
27,"But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and mythoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.",6
28,Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.,7
29,"Ican, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to thisgreat enterprise.",7
30,I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.,7
31,"Iaccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I oftenworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted mynights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and thosebranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derivethe greatest practical advantage.",7
32,"Twice I actually hired myself as anunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.",7
33,"Imust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the seconddignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatestearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.",7
34,"And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?",8
35,"My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory toevery enticement that wealth placed in my path.",8
36,"Oh, that some encouragingvoice would answer in the affirmative!",8
37,"My courage and my resolution isfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed.",8
38,"I amabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of whichwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spiritsof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.",8
39,This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.,9
40,"They flyquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, inmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.",9
41,"Thecold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I havealready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking thedeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exerciseprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.",9
42,I have noambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh andArchangel.,9
43,"I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and myintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying theinsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessaryamong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",10
44,I do not intend tosail until the month of June; and when shall I return?,10
45,"Ah, dear sister, howcan I answer this question?",10
46,"If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,will pass before you and I may meet.",10
47,"If I fail, you will see me again soon,or never.",10
48,"Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret.",11
49,"Heaven shower down blessings on you,and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all yourlove and kindness.",11
50,"Your affectionate brother,",12
51,R. Walton,13
52,Letter 2,15
53,"_To Mrs. Saville, England._",16
54,"Archangel, 28th March, 17—.",17
55,"How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!",18
56,Yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.,18
57,I have hired avessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I havealready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainlypossessed of dauntless courage.,18
58,"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and theabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have nofriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, therewill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, noone will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",19
59,"I shall commit my thoughtsto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication offeeling.",19
60,"I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whoseeyes would reply to mine.",19
61,"You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but Ibitterly feel the want of a friend.",19
62,"I have no one near me, gentle yetcourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whosetastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans.",19
63,How would such afriend repair the faults of your poor brother!,19
64,I am too ardent in executionand too impatient of difficulties.,19
65,But it is a still greater evil to methat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wildon a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.,19
66,At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our owncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive itsmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived thenecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my nativecountry.,19
67,Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than manyschoolboys of fifteen.,19
68,"It is true that I have thought more and that mydaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painterscall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have senseenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me toendeavour to regulate my mind.",19
69,"Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on thewide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.",20
70,"Yetsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in theserugged bosoms.",20
71,"My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courageand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrasemore characteristically, of advancement in his profession.",20
72,"He is anEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments ofhumanity.",20
73,"I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assistin my enterprise.",20
74,The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in theship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline.,21
75,"Thiscircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, mademe very desirous to engage him.",21
76,"A youth passed in solitude, my best yearsspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined thegroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste tothe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to benecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindlinessof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I feltmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services.",21
77,"I heardof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him thehappiness of her life.",21
78,"This, briefly, is his story.",21
79,"Some years ago he loveda young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerablesum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match.",21
80,"He sawhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed intears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,and that her father would never consent to the union.",21
81,"My generous friendreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,instantly abandoned his pursuit.",21
82,"He had already bought a farm with hismoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but hebestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of hisprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the youngwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.",21
83,"But the oldman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returneduntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to herinclinations.",21
84,“What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim.,21
85,"He isso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kindof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conductthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy whichotherwise he would command.",21
86,"Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I canconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I amwavering in my resolutions.",22
87,"Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyageis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.",22
88,"Thewinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and itis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sailsooner than I expected.",22
89,I shall do nothing rashly: you know mesufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever thesafety of others is committed to my care.,22
90,I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of myundertaking.,23
91,"It is impossible to communicate to you a conception ofthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with whichI am preparing to depart.",23
92,"I am going to unexplored regions, to “theland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do notbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn andwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but Iwill disclose a secret.",23
93,"I have often attributed my attachment to, mypassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to thatproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets.",23
94,There is somethingat work in my soul which I do not understand.,23
95,"I am practicallyindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance andlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a beliefin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me outof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisitedregions I am about to explore.",23
96,But to return to dearer considerations.,24
97,"Shall I meet you again, afterhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape ofAfrica or America?",24
98,"I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear tolook on the reverse of the picture.",24
99,Continue for the present to write tome by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions whenI need them most to support my spirits.,24
100,I love you very tenderly.,24
101,"Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.",24
102,"Your affectionate brother, Robert Walton",25
103,Letter 3,27
104,"_To Mrs. Saville, England._",28
105,"July 7th, 17—.",29
106,"My dear Sister,",30
107,I write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advancedon my voyage.,31
108,"This letter will reach England by a merchantman now onits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may notsee my native land, perhaps, for many years.",31
109,"I am, however, in goodspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do thefloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangersof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.",31
110,"Wehave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height ofsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desireto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had notexpected.",31
111,No incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in aletter.,32
112,"One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak areaccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, andI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.",32
113,"Adieu, my dear Margaret.",33
114,"Be assured that for my own sake, as well asyours, I will not rashly encounter danger.",33
115,"I will be cool,persevering, and prudent.",33
116,But success _shall_ crown my endeavours.,34
117,Wherefore not?,34
118,"Thus far Ihave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very starsthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph.",34
119,Why notstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?,34
120,What can stop thedetermined heart and resolved will of man?,34
121,My swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus.,35
122,But I mustfinish.,35
123,Heaven bless my beloved sister!,35
124,R.W.,36
125,Letter 4,38
126,"_To Mrs. Saville, England._",39
127,"August 5th, 17—.",40
128,"So strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbearrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me beforethese papers can come into your possession.",41
129,"Last Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closedin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in whichshe floated.",42
130,"Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as wewere compassed round by a very thick fog.",42
131,"We accordingly lay to,hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",42
132,"About two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched outin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed tohave no end.",43
133,"Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began togrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenlyattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our ownsituation.",43
134,"We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn bydogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; abeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.",43
135,We watched the rapid progressof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among thedistant inequalities of the ice.,43
136,This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.,44
137,"We were, as we believed,many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote thatit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.",44
138,"Shut in, however, byice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with thegreatest attention.",44
139,"About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and beforenight the ice broke and freed our ship.",45
140,"We, however, lay to until themorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses whichfloat about after the breaking up of the ice.",45
141,I profited of this time torest for a few hours.,45
142,"In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck andfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparentlytalking to someone in the sea.",46
143,"It was, in fact, a sledge, like that wehad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a largefragment of ice.",46
144,Only one dog remained alive; but there was a humanbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.,46
145,"He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant ofsome undiscovered island, but a European.",46
146,"When I appeared on deck themaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perishon the open sea.”",46
147,"On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with aforeign accent.",47
148,"“Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”",47
149,You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressedto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should havesupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would nothave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.,48
150,"Ireplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards thenorthern pole.",48
151,Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.,49
152,Good God!,49
153,"Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated forhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless.",49
154,"His limbs werenearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue andsuffering.",49
155,I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.,49
156,"We attemptedto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the freshair he fainted.",49
157,We accordingly brought him back to the deck andrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him toswallow a small quantity.,49
158,As soon as he showed signs of life wewrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of thekitchen stove.,49
159,"By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,which restored him wonderfully.",49
160,"Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I oftenfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.",50
161,"When hehad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin andattended on him as much as my duty would permit.",50
162,"I never saw a moreinteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression ofwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyoneperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the mosttrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, witha beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.",50
163,"But heis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes histeeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.",50
164,"When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep offthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would notallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of bodyand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.",51
165,"Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the icein so strange a vehicle.",51
166,"His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, andhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”",52
167,“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”,53
168,“Yes.”,54
169,"“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up wesaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”",55
170,"This aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude ofquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, hadpursued.",56
171,"Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these goodpeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”",56
172,“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me totrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”,57
173,“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you havebenevolently restored me to life.”,58
174,Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of theice had destroyed the other sledge.,59
175,"I replied that I could not answerwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until nearmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safetybefore that time; but of this I could not judge.",59
176,From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of thestranger.,60
177,"He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch forthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain inthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.",60
178,I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instantnotice if any new object should appear in sight.,60
179,Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to thepresent day.,61
180,The stranger has gradually improved in health but is verysilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.,61
181,"Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are allinterested in him, although they have had very little communicationwith him.",61
182,"For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and hisconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",61
183,"He musthave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreckso attractive and amiable.",61
184,"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friendon the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had beenbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brotherof my heart.",62
185,"I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,should I have any fresh incidents to record.",63
186,"August 13th, 17—.",65
187,My affection for my guest increases every day.,66
188,He excites at once myadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.,66
189,How can I see sonoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignantgrief?,66
190,"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, andwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",66
191,"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",67
192,"Yet, althoughunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that heinterests himself deeply in the projects of others.",67
193,"He has frequentlyconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him withoutdisguise.",67
194,He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of myeventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had takento secure it.,67
195,"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use thelanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my souland to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I wouldsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of myenterprise.",67
196,"One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay forthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I shouldacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.",67
197,"As I spoke, adark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance.",67
198,"At first Iperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands beforehis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears tricklefast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.",67
199,"Ipaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man!",67
200,Do youshare my madness?,67
201,Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught?,67
202,"Hear me;let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”",67
203,"Such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but theparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakenedpowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation werenecessary to restore his composure.",68
204,"Having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despisehimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny ofdespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.",69
205,He askedme the history of my earlier years.,69
206,"The tale was quickly told, but itawakened various trains of reflection.",69
207,"I spoke of my desire of finding afriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind thanhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man couldboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.",69
208,"“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we areunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer thanourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid toperfectionate our weak and faulty natures.",70
209,"I once had a friend, the mostnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respectingfriendship.",70
210,"You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause fordespair.",70
211,But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin lifeanew.”,70
212,"As he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settledgrief that touched me to the heart.",71
213,But he was silent and presentlyretired to his cabin.,71
214,"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than hedoes the beauties of nature.",72
215,"The starry sky, the sea, and every sightafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power ofelevating his soul from earth.",72
216,"Such a man has a double existence: hemay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when hehas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has ahalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",72
217,Will you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divinewanderer?,73
218,You would not if you saw him.,73
219,"You have been tutored andrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are thereforesomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit toappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.",73
220,Sometimes Ihave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses thatelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.,73
221,"Ibelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failingpower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalledfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and avoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.",73
222,"August 19th, 17—.",75
223,"Yesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, CaptainWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",76
224,"I haddetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die withme, but you have won me to alter my determination.",76
225,"You seek forknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that thegratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as minehas been.",76
226,"I do not know that the relation of my disasters will beuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the samecourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered mewhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, onethat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console youin case of failure.",76
227,Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usuallydeemed marvellous.,76
228,"Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I mightfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many thingswill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which wouldprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powersof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its seriesinternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”",76
229,"You may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offeredcommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief bya recital of his misfortunes.",77
230,"I felt the greatest eagerness to hearthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strongdesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.",77
231,I expressedthese feelings in my answer.,77
232,"“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it isuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.",78
233,"I wait but for one event, and then Ishall repose in peace.",78
234,"I understand your feeling,” continued he,perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, myfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter mydestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it isdetermined.”",78
235,He then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when Ishould be at leisure.,79
236,This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.,79
237,"I haveresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, torecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related duringthe day.",79
238,"If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes.",79
239,"Thismanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, whoknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest andsympathy shall I read it in some future day!",79
240,"Even now, as I commence mytask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on mewith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised inanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soulwithin.",79
241,"Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm whichembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!",79
242,Chapter 1,81
243,"I am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the mostdistinguished of that republic.",82
244,"My ancestors had been for many yearscounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several publicsituations with honour and reputation.",82
245,He was respected by all whoknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to publicbusiness.,82
246,"He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by theaffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented hismarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became ahusband and the father of a family.",82
247,"As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannotrefrain from relating them.",83
248,"One of his most intimate friends was amerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerousmischances, into poverty.",83
249,"This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of aproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in povertyand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly beendistinguished for his rank and magnificence.",83
250,"Having paid his debts,therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with hisdaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and inwretchedness.",83
251,My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship andwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.,83
252,He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conductso little worthy of the affection that united them.,83
253,"He lost no time inendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to beginthe world again through his credit and assistance.",83
254,"Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was tenmonths before my father discovered his abode.",84
255,"Overjoyed at this discovery,he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near theReuss.",84
256,"But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him.",84
257,"Beauforthad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, butit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and inthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in amerchant’s house.",84
258,"The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure forreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the endof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.",84
259,"His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she sawwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and thatthere was no other prospect of support.",85
260,"But Caroline Beaufortpossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to supporther in her adversity.",85
261,She procured plain work; she plaited straw andby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient tosupport life.,85
262,Several months passed in this manner.,86
263,"Her father grew worse; her timewas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistencedecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leavingher an orphan and a beggar.",86
264,"This last blow overcame her, and she kneltby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered thechamber.",86
265,"He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, whocommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend heconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of arelation.",86
266,Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.,86
267,"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, butthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devotedaffection.",87
268,There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mindwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to lovestrongly.,87
269,Perhaps during former years he had suffered from thelate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to seta greater value on tried worth.,87
270,"There was a show of gratitude andworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from thedoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for hervirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensingher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible graceto his behaviour to her.",87
271,Everything was made to yield to her wishesand her convenience.,87
272,"He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic issheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround herwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft andbenevolent mind.",87
273,"Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hithertoconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.",87
274,"Duringthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father hadgradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately aftertheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the changeof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,as a restorative for her weakened frame.",87
275,From Italy they visited Germany and France.,88
276,"I, their eldest child, was bornat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles.",88
277,I remainedfor several years their only child.,88
278,"Much as they were attached to eachother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a verymine of love to bestow them upon me.",88
279,My mother’s tender caresses andmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are myfirst recollections.,88
280,"I was their plaything and their idol, and somethingbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed onthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was intheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilledtheir duties towards me.",88
281,"With this deep consciousness of what they owedtowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spiritof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while duringevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed butone train of enjoyment to me.",88
282,For a long time I was their only care.,89
283,"My mother had much desired to have adaughter, but I continued their single offspring.",89
284,"When I was about fiveyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, theypassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como.",89
285,Their benevolentdisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.,89
286,"This, to mymother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, apassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had beenrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to theafflicted.",89
287,"During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a valeattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the numberof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worstshape.",89
288,"One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,accompanied by me, visited this abode.",89
289,"She found a peasant and his wife,hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal tofive hungry babes.",89
290,Among these there was one which attracted my mother farabove all the rest.,89
291,She appeared of a different stock.,89
292,"The four others weredark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair.",89
293,"Herhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of herclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head.",89
294,"Her brow wasclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding ofher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could beholdher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.",89
295,"The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder andadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history.",90
296,"She wasnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman.",90
297,Her mother was aGerman and had died on giving her birth.,90
298,The infant had been placed withthese good people to nurse: they were better off then.,90
299,"They had not beenlong married, and their eldest child was but just born.",90
300,"The father of theircharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique gloryof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exertedhimself to obtain the liberty of his country.",90
301,He became the victim of itsweakness.,90
302,Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austriawas not known.,90
303,His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan anda beggar.,90
304,"She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rudeabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.",90
305,"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall ofour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemedto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighterthan the chamois of the hills.",91
306,The apparition was soon explained.,91
307,With hispermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield theircharge to her.,91
308,They were fond of the sweet orphan.,91
309,"Her presence had seemeda blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in povertyand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection.",91
310,"Theyconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenzabecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more thansister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations andmy pleasures.",91
311,Everyone loved Elizabeth.,92
312,"The passionate and almost reverentialattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, mypride and my delight.",92
313,"On the evening previous to her being brought tomy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for myVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, shepresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childishseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabethas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.",92
314,All praises bestowed onher I received as made to a possession of my own.,92
315,We called each otherfamiliarly by the name of cousin.,92
316,"No word, no expression could bodyforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more thansister, since till death she was to be mine only.",92
317,Chapter 2,94
318,We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference inour ages.,95
319,I need not say that we were strangers to any species ofdisunion or dispute.,95
320,"Harmony was the soul of our companionship, andthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew usnearer together.",95
321,"Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrateddisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intenseapplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.",95
322,"She busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swisshome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence ofour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.",95
323,"While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit themagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating theircauses.",95
324,The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.,95
325,"Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among theearliest sensations I can remember.",95
326,"On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gaveup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their nativecountry.",96
327,"We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than aleague from the city.",96
328,"We resided principally in the latter, and thelives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.",96
329,It was mytemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.,96
330,"I wasindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I unitedmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.",96
331,HenryClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.,96
332,He was a boy of singulartalent and fancy.,96
333,"He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger forits own sake.",96
334,He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.,96
335,Hecomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment andknightly adventure.,96
336,"He tried to make us act plays and to enter intomasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes ofRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalroustrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the handsof the infidels.",96
337,No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.,97
338,Myparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.,97
339,"We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according totheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delightswhich we enjoyed.",97
340,"When I mingled with other families I distinctlydiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assistedthe development of filial love.",97
341,"My temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by somelaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuitsbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all thingsindiscriminately.",98
342,"I confess that neither the structure of languages,nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various statespossessed attractions for me.",98
343,"It was the secrets of heaven and earththat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance ofthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of manthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.",98
344,"Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moralrelations of things.",99
345,"The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream wasto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as thegallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.",99
346,The saintly soulof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.,99
347,"Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance ofher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.",99
348,"She wasthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have becomesullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but thatshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.",99
349,AndClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?,99
350,"Yethe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in hisgenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion foradventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness ofbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaringambition.",99
351,"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions ofextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",100
352,"Besides,in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events whichled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I wouldaccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled mydestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almostforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrentwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.",100
353,"Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to mypredilection for that science.",101
354,When I was thirteen years of age we all wenton a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of theweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.,101
355,In this house Ichanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.,101
356,I opened itwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderfulfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.,101
357,"A newlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated mydiscovery to my father.",101
358,"My father looked carelessly at the title page of mybook and said, “Ah!",101
359,Cornelius Agrippa!,101
360,"My dear Victor, do not wasteyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”",101
361,"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to methat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modernsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powersthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, whilethose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances Ishould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented myimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to myformer studies.",102
362,It is even possible that the train of my ideas would neverhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.,102
363,"But the cursory glancemy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he wasacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatestavidity.",102
364,"When I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of thisauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",103
365,I read andstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to metreasures known to few besides myself.,103
366,I have described myself as alwayshaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets ofnature.,103
367,"In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modernphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.",103
368,Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child pickingup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth.,103
369,Those of hissuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquaintedappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the samepursuit.,103
370,The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquaintedwith their practical uses.,104
371,The most learned philosopher knew littlemore.,104
372,"He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortallineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.",104
373,"He might dissect,anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causesin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.",104
374,"Ihad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keephuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly andignorantly I had repined.",104
375,"But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knewmore.",105
376,"I took their word for all that they averred, and I became theirdisciple.",105
377,"It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenthcentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools ofGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favouritestudies.",105
378,"My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with achild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.",105
379,Under the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatestdiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixirof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention.,105
380,"Wealth was aninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I couldbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any buta violent death!",105
381,Nor were these my only visions.,106
382,"The raising of ghosts or devils was apromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of whichI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, Iattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to awant of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",106
383,"And thus for a time I wasoccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousandcontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough ofmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childishreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.",106
384,"When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house nearBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm.",107
385,"Itadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at oncewith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",107
386,"I remained,while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.",107
387,"As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from anold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and sosoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothingremained but a blasted stump.",107
388,"When we visited it the next morning, we foundthe tree shattered in a singular manner.",107
389,"It was not splintered by theshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.",107
390,I never beheldanything so utterly destroyed.,107
391,Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws ofelectricity.,108
392,"On this occasion a man of great research in naturalphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered onthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject ofelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.",108
393,"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but bysome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue myaccustomed studies.",108
394,It seemed to me as if nothing would or could everbe known.,108
395,All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grewdespicable.,108
396,"By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhapsmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my formeroccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformedand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for awould-be science which could never even step within the threshold ofreal knowledge.",108
397,"In this mood of mind I betook myself to themathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science asbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.",108
398,"Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligamentsare we bound to prosperity or ruin.",109
399,"When I look back, it seems to meas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was theimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effortmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was eventhen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.",109
400,Her victory wasannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul whichfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormentingstudies.,109
401,"It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil withtheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.",109
402,"It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.",110
403,"Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter andterrible destruction.",110
404,Chapter 3,112
405,When I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that Ishould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.,113
406,"I hadhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought itnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be madeacquainted with other customs than those of my native country.",113
407,"Mydeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the dayresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my lifeoccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.",113
408,"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she wasin the greatest danger.",114
409,During her illness many arguments had been urged topersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.,114
410,"She had at firstyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of herfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety.",114
411,"Sheattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignityof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of thisimprudence were fatal to her preserver.",114
412,"On the third day my mothersickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and thelooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event.",114
413,On herdeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not deserther.,114
414,She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself.,114
415,"“Mychildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness wereplaced on the prospect of your union.",114
416,This expectation will now be theconsolation of your father.,114
417,"Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place tomy younger children.",114
418,Alas!,114
419,"I regret that I am taken from you; and, happyand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?",114
420,But these arenot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully todeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”,114
421,"She died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",115
422,"I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rentby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to thesoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",115
423,"It is solong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every dayand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departedfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have beenextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the earcan be hushed, never more to be heard.",115
424,"These are the reflections ofthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of theevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.",115
425,Yet from whom hasnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection?,115
426,"And why should Idescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",115
427,"The time atlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; andthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed asacrilege, is not banished.",115
428,"My mother was dead, but we had stillduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with therest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom thespoiler has not seized.",115
429,"My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,was now again determined upon.",116
430,I obtained from my father a respite ofsome weeks.,116
431,"It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick oflife.",116
432,"I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.",116
433,"I wasunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and aboveall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.",116
434,She indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.,117
435,She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage andzeal.,117
436,She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to callher uncle and cousins.,117
437,"Never was she so enchanting as at this time,when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.",117
438,She forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.,117
439,The day of my departure at length arrived.,118
440,Clerval spent the lastevening with us.,118
441,"He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permithim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.",118
442,Hisfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in theaspirations and ambition of his son.,118
443,Henry deeply felt the misfortuneof being debarred from a liberal education.,118
444,"He said little, but whenhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance arestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable detailsof commerce.",118
445,We sat late.,119
446,"We could not tear ourselves away from each other norpersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!” It was said, and weretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that theother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to thecarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my fatheragain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth torenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the lastfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.",119
447,I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged inthe most melancholy reflections.,120
448,"I, who had ever been surrounded byamiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutualpleasure—I was now alone.",120
449,In the university whither I was going Imust form my own friends and be my own protector.,120
450,"My life had hithertobeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invinciblerepugnance to new countenances.",120
451,"I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, andClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myselftotally unfitted for the company of strangers.",120
452,"Such were my reflections asI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.",120
453,Iardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.,120
454,"I had often, when at home,thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and hadlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.",120
455,"Now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly torepent.",120
456,"I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during myjourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",121
457,At length thehigh white steeple of the town met my eyes.,121
458,I alighted and wasconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.,121
459,The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit tosome of the principal professors.,122
460,"Chance—or rather the evilinfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over mefrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’sdoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.",122
461,"Hewas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science.",122
462,Heasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branchesof science appertaining to natural philosophy.,122
463,"I replied carelessly, andpartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principalauthors I had studied.",122
464,The professor stared.,122
465,"“Have you,” hesaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”",122
466,I replied in the affirmative.,123
467,"“Every minute,” continued M. Krempe withwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterlyand entirely lost.",123
468,You have burdened your memory with exploded systemsand useless names.,123
469,Good God!,123
470,"In what desert land have you lived,where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which youhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as theyare ancient?",123
471,"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientificage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",123
472,"My dearsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”",123
473,"So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several bookstreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, anddismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the followingweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon naturalphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellowprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that heomitted.",124
474,"I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had longconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but Ireturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in anyshape.",125
475,"M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and arepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me infavour of his pursuits.",125
476,"In rather a too philosophical and connected astrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had cometo concerning them in my early years.",125
477,As a child I had not beencontent with the results promised by the modern professors of naturalscience.,125
478,"With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by myextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod thesteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged thediscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.",125
479,"Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.",125
480,"It was very different when the masters of the science soughtimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but nowthe scene was changed.",125
481,The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limititself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest inscience was chiefly founded.,125
482,I was required to exchange chimeras ofboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.,125
483,"Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of myresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becomingacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my newabode.",126
484,"But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the informationwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",126
485,"And although Icould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliversentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",126
486,"Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturingroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",127
487,This professor was veryunlike his colleague.,127
488,"He appeared about fifty years of age, but with anaspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered histemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black.",127
489,His personwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.,127
490,"He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry andthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncingwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers.",127
491,He then tooka cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many ofits elementary terms.,127
492,"After having made a few preparatory experiments, heconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which Ishall never forget:",127
493,"“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,“promised impossibilities and performed nothing.",128
494,"The modern masterspromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and thatthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seemonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope orcrucible, have indeed performed miracles.",128
495,They penetrate into the recessesof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places.,128
496,"They ascend into theheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature ofthe air we breathe.",128
497,"They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and evenmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”",128
498,Such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words ofthe fate—enounced to destroy me.,129
499,"As he went on I felt as if my soulwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys weretouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord wassounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,one purpose.",129
500,"So much has been done, exclaimed the soul ofFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the stepsalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, andunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.",129
501,I closed not my eyes that night.,130
502,"My internal being was in a state ofinsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but Ihad no power to produce it.",130
503,"By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,sleep came.",130
504,"I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.",130
505,There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and todevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess anatural talent.,130
506,On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.,130
507,"Hismanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which inhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.",130
508,Igave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I hadgiven to his fellow professor.,130
509,"He heard with attention the littlenarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of CorneliusAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe hadexhibited.",130
510,He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zealmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of theirknowledge.,130
511,"They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new namesand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in agreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",130
512,"Thelabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely everfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” Ilistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumptionor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed myprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measuredterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to hisinstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would havemade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intendedlabours.",130
513,I requested his advice concerning the books I ought toprocure.,130
514,"“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained adisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt ofyour success.",131
515,"Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which thegreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account thatI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have notneglected the other branches of science.",131
516,A man would make but a very sorrychemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone.,131
517,"If yourwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a pettyexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of naturalphilosophy, including mathematics.”",131
518,"He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of hisvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure andpromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough inthe science not to derange their mechanism.",132
519,"He also gave me the list ofbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.",132
520,Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.,133
521,Chapter 4,135
522,"From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in themost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",136
523,"I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",136
524,"I attended thelectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of theuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound senseand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsivephysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",136
525,InM. Waldman I found a true friend.,136
526,"His gentleness was never tinged bydogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness andgood nature that banished every idea of pedantry.",136
527,In a thousand wayshe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruseinquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.,136
528,My application was atfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded andsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in thelight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.,136
529,"As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progresswas rapid.",137
530,"My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, andmy proficiency that of the masters.",137
531,"Professor Krempe often asked me,with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldmanexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.",137
532,"Two yearspassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but wasengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which Ihoped to make.",137
533,None but those who have experienced them can conceiveof the enticements of science.,137
534,"In other studies you go as far asothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but ina scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.",137
535,"A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study mustinfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, whocontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and wassolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of twoyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemicalinstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at theuniversity.",137
536,"When I had arrived at this point and had become as wellacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy asdepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, myresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thoughtof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incidenthappened that protracted my stay.",137
537,"One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention wasthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued withlife.",138
538,"Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",138
539,"It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as amystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becomingacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain ourinquiries.",138
540,I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determinedthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches ofnatural philosophy which relate to physiology.,138
541,"Unless I had beenanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to thisstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable.",138
542,"To examine thecauses of life, we must first have recourse to death.",138
543,"I becameacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; Imust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.",138
544,In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that mymind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.,138
545,I do not everremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have fearedthe apparition of a spirit.,138
546,"Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, anda churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived oflife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had becomefood for the worm.",138
547,Now I was led to examine the cause and progress ofthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults andcharnel-houses.,138
548,My attention was fixed upon every object the mostinsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.,138
549,I saw how thefine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption ofdeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worminherited the wonders of the eye and brain.,138
550,"I paused, examining andanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the changefrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of thisdarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant andwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensityof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among somany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the samescience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing asecret.",138
551,"Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",139
552,The sun does notmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm istrue.,139
553,"Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of thediscovery were distinct and probable.",139
554,"After days and nights ofincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause ofgeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowinganimation upon lifeless matter.",139
555,The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discoverysoon gave place to delight and rapture.,140
556,"After so much time spent inpainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was themost gratifying consummation of my toils.",140
557,"But this discovery was sogreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had beenprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",140
558,What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creationof the world was now within my grasp.,140
559,"Not that, like a magic scene, itall opened upon me at once: the information I had obtained was of anature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point themtowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object alreadyaccomplished.",140
560,"I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the deadand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seeminglyineffectual light.",140
561,"I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyesexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret withwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the endof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon thatsubject.",141
562,"I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,to your destruction and infallible misery.",141
563,"Learn from me, if not by myprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement ofknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native townto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his naturewill allow.",141
564,"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitateda long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",142
565,"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet toprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies offibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivabledifficulty and labour.",142
566,"I doubted at first whether I should attempt thecreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but myimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me todoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderfulas man.",142
567,"The materials at present within my command hardly appearedadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I shouldultimately succeed.",142
568,"I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; myoperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work beimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takesplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my presentattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.",142
569,Norcould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as anyargument of its impracticability.,142
570,It was with these feelings that Ibegan the creation of a human being.,142
571,"As the minuteness of the partsformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my firstintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.",142
572,"After havingformed this determination and having spent some months in successfullycollecting and arranging my materials, I began.",142
573,"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, likea hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",143
574,"Life and deathappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, andpour a torrent of light into our dark world.",143
575,A new species would blessme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures wouldowe their being to me.,143
576,No father could claim the gratitude of hischild so completely as I should deserve theirs.,143
577,"Pursuing thesereflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifelessmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",143
578,"These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertakingwith unremitting ardour.",144
579,"My cheek had grown pale with study, and myperson had become emaciated with confinement.",144
580,"Sometimes, on the verybrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which thenext day or the next hour might realise.",144
581,"One secret which I alonepossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moongazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathlesseagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.",144
582,Who shall conceivethe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed dampsof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifelessclay?,144
583,"My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; butthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemedto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.",144
584,"It wasindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewedacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I hadreturned to my old habits.",144
585,"I collected bones from charnel-houses anddisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the humanframe.",144
586,"In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting fromtheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment.",144
587,"Thedissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, Ibrought my work near to a conclusion.",144
588,"The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, inone pursuit.",145
589,"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fieldsbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriantvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",145
590,"And thesame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me alsoto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I hadnot seen for so long a time.",145
591,"I knew my silence disquieted them, and Iwell remembered the words of my father: “I know that while you arepleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shallhear regularly from you.",145
592,You must pardon me if I regard anyinterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other dutiesare equally neglected.”,145
593,"I knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I couldnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but whichhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",146
594,"I wished, as itwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affectionuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,should be completed.",146
595,"I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglectto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he wasjustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free fromblame.",147
596,A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm andpeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire todisturb his tranquillity.,147
597,I do not think that the pursuit of knowledgeis an exception to this rule.,147
598,"If the study to which you apply yourselfhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste forthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then thatstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the humanmind.",147
599,"If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuitwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domesticaffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared hiscountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and theempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",147
600,"But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of mytale, and your looks remind me to proceed.",148
601,My father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of mysilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.,149
602,"Winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did notwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before alwaysyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in myoccupation.",149
603,"The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew nearto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I hadsucceeded.",149
604,"But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appearedrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any otherunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",149
605,"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a mostpainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellowcreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime.",149
606,"Sometimes I grew alarmed atthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alonesustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise andamusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myselfboth of these when my creation should be complete.",149
607,Chapter 5,151
608,It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishmentof my toils.,152
609,"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, Icollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse aspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",152
610,"It wasalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against thepanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of thehalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creatureopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.",152
611,"How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineatethe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured toform?",153
612,"His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features asbeautiful.",153
613,Beautiful!,153
614,Great God!,153
615,"His yellow skin scarcely coveredthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrousblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but theseluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in whichthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.",153
616,The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelingsof human nature.,154
617,"I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the solepurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",154
618,For this I haddeprived myself of rest and health.,154
619,"I had desired it with an ardourthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beautyof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled myheart.",154
620,"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, Irushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing mybed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.",154
621,"At length lassitudesucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on thebed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",154
622,"But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildestdreams.",154
623,"I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking inthe streets of Ingolstadt.",154
624,"Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid withthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that Iheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped herform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",154
625,"I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, myteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim andyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the windowshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I hadcreated.",154
626,"He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes theymay be called, were fixed on me.",154
627,"His jaws opened, and he muttered someinarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",154
628,"He might havespoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly todetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.",154
629,"I took refuge in thecourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remainedduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatestagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as ifit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which Ihad so miserably given life.",154
630,Oh!,155
631,No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.,155
632,A mummyagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.,155
633,"Ihad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when thosemuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thingsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.",155
634,I passed the night wretchedly.,156
635,"Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly andhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearlysank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",156
636,"Mingled withthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that hadbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become ahell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",156
637,"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to mysleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steepleand clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",157
638,"The porter opened the gatesof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued intothe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid thewretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to myview.",157
639,"I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, butfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which pouredfrom a black and comfortless sky.",157
640,"I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring bybodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",158
641,Itraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was orwhat I was doing.,158
642,"My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and Ihurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:  Like one who, on a lonely road, Doth walk in fear and dread, And, having once turned round, walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.",158
643,[Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”],158
644,"Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the variousdiligences and carriages usually stopped.",160
645,"Here I paused, I knew not why;but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was comingtowards me from the other end of the street.",160
646,"As it drew nearer I observedthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, andon the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,instantly sprung out.",160
647,"“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,“how glad I am to see you!",160
648,How fortunate that you should be here atthe very moment of my alighting!”,160
649,"Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought backto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dearto my recollection.",161
650,"I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horrorand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,calm and serene joy.",161
651,"I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordialmanner, and we walked towards my college.",161
652,Clerval continued talking forsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in beingpermitted to come to Ingolstadt.,161
653,"“You may easily believe,” saidhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that allnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constantanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutchschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florinsa year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But hisaffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he haspermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land ofknowledge.”",161
654,"“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you leftmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”",162
655,"“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear fromyou so seldom.",163
656,"By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon theiraccount myself.",163
657,"But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stoppingshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very illyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching forseveral nights.”",163
658,"“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in oneoccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at anend and that I am at length free.”",164
659,"I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less toallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.",165
660,"I walked with aquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.",165
661,"I then reflected, andthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in myapartment might still be there, alive and walking about.",165
662,"I dreaded tobehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",165
663,"Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of thestairs, I darted up towards my own room.",165
664,My hand was already on thelock of the door before I recollected myself.,165
665,"I then paused, and acold shivering came over me.",165
666,"I threw the door forcibly open, aschildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand inwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.",165
667,"I steppedfearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freedfrom its hideous guest.",165
668,"I could hardly believe that so great a goodfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemyhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.",165
669,"We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;but I was unable to contain myself.",166
670,"It was not joy only that possessedme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulsebeat rapidly.",166
671,"I was unable to remain for a single instant in the sameplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",166
672,"Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyesfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartlesslaughter frightened and astonished him.",166
673,"“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,is the matter?",167
674,Do not laugh in that manner.,167
675,How ill you are!,167
676,What is thecause of all this?”,167
677,"“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for Ithought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ cantell.",168
678,"Oh, save me!",168
679,Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.,168
680,Poor Clerval!,169
681,What must have been his feelings?,169
682,"A meeting, which heanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",169
683,"But Iwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did notrecover my senses for a long, long time.",169
684,This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me forseveral months.,170
685,During all that time Henry was my only nurse.,170
686,"Iafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitnessfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would makeElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of mydisorder.",170
687,"He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentivenurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, hedid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindestaction that he could towards them.",170
688,"But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded andunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",171
689,"The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for everbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",171
690,"Doubtless mywords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderingsof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which Icontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorderindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",171
691,"By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed andgrieved my friend, I recovered.",172
692,"I remember the first time I becamecapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, Iperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the youngbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",172
693,"It wasa divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to myconvalescence.",172
694,"I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive inmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became ascheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.",172
695,"“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very goodyou are to me.",173
696,"This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as youpromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",173
697,How shall I everrepay you?,173
698,"I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which Ihave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”",173
699,"“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but getwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, Imay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”",174
700,I trembled.,175
701,One subject!,175
702,What could it be?,175
703,Could he allude to an object onwhom I dared not even think?,175
704,"“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change ofcolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your fatherand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in yourown handwriting.",176
705,They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy atyour long silence.”,176
706,"“Is that all, my dear Henry?",177
707,"How could you suppose that my firstthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love andwho are so deserving of my love?”",177
708,"“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be gladto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is fromyour cousin, I believe.”",178
709,Chapter 6,180
710,Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.,181
711,It was from myown Elizabeth:,181
712,"“My dearest Cousin,",182
713,"“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dearkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.",183
714,"You areforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,is necessary to calm our apprehensions.",183
715,"For a long time I have thoughtthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions haverestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",183
716,"I haveprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of solong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able toperform it myself!",183
717,"I figure to myself that the task of attending onyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could neverguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection ofyour poor cousin.",183
718,Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeedyou are getting better.,183
719,I eagerly hope that you will confirm thisintelligence soon in your own handwriting.,183
720,“Get well—and return to us.,184
721,"You will find a happy, cheerful home andfriends who love you dearly.",184
722,"Your father’s health is vigorous, and heasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not acare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.",184
723,How pleased you wouldbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest!,184
724,He is now sixteen and fullof activity and spirit.,184
725,"He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enterinto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until hiselder brother returns to us.",184
726,"My uncle is not pleased with the idea ofa military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had yourpowers of application.",184
727,"He looks upon study as an odious fetter; histime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on thelake.",184
728,I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the pointand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.,184
729,"“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has takenplace since you left us.",185
730,The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—theynever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts areregulated by the same immutable laws.,185
731,"My trifling occupations take upmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeingnone but happy, kind faces around me.",185
732,"Since you left us, but onechange has taken place in our little household.",185
733,Do you remember onwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?,185
734,"Probably you do not;I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.",185
735,"Madame Moritz,her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was thethird.",185
736,"This girl had always been the favourite of her father, butthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, andafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observedthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her motherto allow her to live at our house.",185
737,The republican institutions of ourcountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those whichprevail in the great monarchies that surround it.,185
738,"Hence there is lessdistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and thelower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners aremore refined and moral.",185
739,A servant in Geneva does not mean the samething as a servant in France and England.,185
740,"Justine, thus received inour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in ourfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and asacrifice of the dignity of a human being.",185
741,"“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and Irecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, oneglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason thatAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked sofrank-hearted and happy.",186
742,"My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,by which she was induced to give her an education superior to thatwhich she had at first intended.",186
743,"This benefit was fully repaid;Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do notmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, butyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.",186
744,"Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.",186
745,"Shethought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate herphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.",186
746,"“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their owngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illnesswith the most anxious affection.",187
747,Poor Justine was very ill; but othertrials were reserved for her.,187
748,"“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with theexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",188
749,Theconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that thedeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise herpartiality.,188
750,She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessorconfirmed the idea which she had conceived.,188
751,"Accordingly, a few monthsafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by herrepentant mother.",188
752,Poor girl!,188
753,"She wept when she quitted our house; shewas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softnessand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkablefor vivacity.",188
754,Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a natureto restore her gaiety.,188
755,The poor woman was very vacillating in herrepentance.,188
756,"She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of herbrothers and sister.",188
757,"Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritzinto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she isnow at peace for ever.",188
758,"She died on the first approach of cold weather,at the beginning of this last winter.",188
759,Justine has just returned to us;and I assure you I love her tenderly.,188
760,"She is very clever and gentle,and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and herexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.",188
761,"“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darlingWilliam.",189
762,"I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, withsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.",189
763,"When hesmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy withhealth.",189
764,"He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Bironis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",189
765,"“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a littlegossip concerning the good people of Geneva.",190
766,"The pretty Miss Mansfieldhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approachingmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",190
767,"Her uglysister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.",190
768,"Yourfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunessince the departure of Clerval from Geneva.",190
769,"But he has alreadyrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying alively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",190
770,"She is a widow, and mucholder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite witheverybody.",190
771,"“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxietyreturns upon me as I conclude.",191
772,"Write, dearest Victor,—one line—oneword will be a blessing to us.",191
773,"Ten thousand thanks to Henry for hiskindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerelygrateful.",191
774,Adieu!,191
775,"my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreatyou, write!",191
776,“Elizabeth Lavenza.,192
777,"“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”",193
778,"“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read herletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxietythey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; butmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly.",195
779,In anotherfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.,195
780,One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to theseveral professors of the university.,196
781,"In doing this, I underwent akind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind hadsustained.",196
782,"Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and thebeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy evento the name of natural philosophy.",196
783,"When I was otherwise quite restoredto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agonyof my nervous symptoms.",196
784,"Henry saw this, and had removed all myapparatus from my view.",196
785,He had also changed my apartment; for heperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which hadpreviously been my laboratory.,196
786,But these cares of Clerval were made ofno avail when I visited the professors.,196
787,"M. Waldman inflicted torturewhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress Ihad made in the sciences.",196
788,"He soon perceived that I disliked thesubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings tomodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the scienceitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.",196
789,Whatcould I do?,196
790,"He meant to please, and he tormented me.",196
791,"I felt as if hehad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments whichwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.",196
792,"Iwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",196
793,"Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning thesensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, histotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",196
794,"Ithanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",196
795,"I saw plainlythat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret fromme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverencethat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide inhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but whichI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.",196
796,"M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, ofalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me evenmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",197
797,"“D—nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he hasoutstript us all.",197
798,"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",197
799,"Ayoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmlyas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and ifhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,“M.",197
800,Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.,197
801,"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I wasmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”",197
802,"M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turnedthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",198
803,Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and hisliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.,199
804,"Hecame to the university with the design of making himself completemaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field forthe plan of life he had marked out for himself.",199
805,"Resolved to pursue noinglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affordingscope for his spirit of enterprise.",199
806,"The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskritlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter onthe same studies.",199
807,"Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that Iwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I feltgreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found notonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.",199
808,"Idid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, forI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporaryamusement.",199
809,"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they wellrepaid my labours.",199
810,"Their melancholy is soothing, and their joyelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors ofany other country.",199
811,"When you read their writings, life appears toconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frownsof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.",199
812,Howdifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!,199
813,"Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva wasfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by severalaccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",200
814,I felt thisdelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my belovedfriends.,200
815,"My return had only been delayed so long, from anunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had becomeacquainted with any of its inhabitants.",200
816,"The winter, however, was spentcheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it cameits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.",200
817,"The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter dailywhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed apedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid apersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",201
818,"I accededwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clervalhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this naturethat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",201
819,"We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spiritshad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from thesalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, andthe conversation of my friend.",202
820,"Study had before secluded me from theintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; butClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taughtme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",202
821,Excellent friend!,202
822,"how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour toelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.",202
823,"A selfishpursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness andaffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creaturewho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",202
824,"When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the mostdelightful sensations.",202
825,A serene sky and verdant fields filled me withecstasy.,202
826,"The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of springbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.",202
827,"Iwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressedupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with aninvincible burden.",202
828,"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: heexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filledhis soul.",203
829,"The resources of his mind on this occasion were trulyastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, inimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderfulfancy and passion.",203
830,"At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drewme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.",203
831,"We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants weredancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",204
832,"My own spirits werehigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.",204

835,"“My dear Victor,",208
836,"“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date ofyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a fewlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",209
837,"Butthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",209
838,"What would beyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, tobehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?",209
839,"And how, Victor, canI relate our misfortune?",209
840,Absence cannot have rendered you callous toour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absentson?,209

848,We accordingly rested on a seat untilthey should return.,212
849,"Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seenhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that Williamhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, andafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.",212
850,"“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for himuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might havereturned to the house.",213
851,He was not there.,213
852,"We returned again, withtorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy hadlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.",213
853,"About five in the morning Idiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming andactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; theprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.",213

855,She was very earnest tosee the corpse.,214

859,"When she againlived, it was only to weep and sigh.",215

905,"The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as Iapproached my native town.",232

919,Alas!,234
920,"I prophesied truly, and failed only in one singlecircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did notconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",234

923,"As I could not pass through thetown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.",235
924,During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of MontBlanc in the most beautiful figures.,235

926,"It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the raincoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.",235
927,"I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and stormincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crashover my head.",236
928,"It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps ofSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating thelake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instantevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itselffrom the preceding flash.",236
929,"The storm, as is often the case inSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",236
930,"Themost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of thelake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village ofCopêt.",236
931,"Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and anotherdarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to theeast of the lake.",236
932,"While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on witha hasty step.",237
933,"This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped myhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel!",237
934,"this is thyfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in thegloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stoodfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",237
935,"A flash of lightningilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; itsgigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongsto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthydæmon, to whom I had given life.",237
936,What did he there?,237
937,Could he be (Ishuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?,237
938,"No sooner did thatidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teethchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",237
939,"The figurepassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",237
940,Nothing in human shape couldhave destroyed the fair child.,237
941,_He_ was the murderer!,237
942,I could notdoubt it.,237
943,The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of thefact.,237
944,"I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, foranother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearlyperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on thesouth.",237
945,"He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.",237
946,I remained motionless.,238
947,"The thunder ceased; but the rain stillcontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",238
948,Irevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance ofthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.,238
949,Two years hadnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; andwas this his first crime?,238
950,Alas!,238
951,"I had turned loose into the world adepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he notmurdered my brother?",238
952,"No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of thenight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",239
953,But I did notfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy inscenes of evil and despair.,239
954,"I considered the being whom I had castamong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposesof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the lightof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forcedto destroy all that was dear to me.",239
955,Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.,240
956,"The gates wereopen, and I hastened to my father’s house.",240
957,"My first thought was todiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to bemade.",240
958,But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.,240
959,"Abeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me atmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",240
960,"Iremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just atthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air ofdelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.",240
961,"I well knew thatif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should havelooked upon it as the ravings of insanity.",240
962,"Besides, the strange natureof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far creditedas to persuade my relatives to commence it.",240
963,And then of what use wouldbe pursuit?,240
964,Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling theoverhanging sides of Mont Salêve?,240
965,"These reflections determined me, andI resolved to remain silent.",240
966,It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.,241
967,"Itold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the libraryto attend their usual hour of rising.",241
968,"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and Istood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before mydeparture for Ingolstadt.",242
969,Beloved and venerable parent!,242
970,He still remainedto me.,242
971,"I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over themantel-piece.",242
972,"It was an historical subject, painted at my father’sdesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneelingby the coffin of her dead father.",242
973,"Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted thesentiment of pity.",242
974,Below this picture was a miniature of William; and mytears flowed when I looked upon it.,242
975,"While I was thus engaged, Ernestentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he.",242
976,“Ah!,242
977,"I wish youhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous anddelighted.",242
978,"You come to us now to share a misery which nothing canalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seemssinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poorElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—PoorWilliam!",242
979,he was our darling and our pride!”,242
980,"Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortalagony crept over my frame.",243
981,"Before, I had only imagined thewretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, anda not less terrible, disaster.",243
982,"I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired moreminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.",243
983,"“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accusedherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made hervery wretched.",244
984,But since the murderer has been discovered—”,244
985,“The murderer discovered!,245
986,Good God!,245
987,how can that be?,245
988,who could attemptto pursue him?,245

990,I saw him too; hewas free last night!”,245
991,"“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents ofwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.",246
992,"Noone would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not beconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",246

996,"But it iswrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”",247
997,"“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that havealmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been soconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,leaves no hope for doubt.",248
998,"But she will be tried today, and you willthen hear all.”",248
999,"He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor Williamhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to herbed for several days.",249
1000,"During this interval, one of the servants,happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of themurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, whichhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.",249
1001,"The servantinstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word toany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,Justine was apprehended.",249
1002,"On being charged with the fact, the poor girlconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion ofmanner.",249
1003,"This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I repliedearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",250
1004,"Justine, poor,good Justine, is innocent.”",250
1005,At that instant my father entered.,251
1006,"I saw unhappiness deeply impressedon his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introducedsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,“Good God, papa!",251
1007,Victor says that he knows who was the murderer ofpoor William.”,251
1008,"“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I hadrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so muchdepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”",252
1009,"“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”",253
1010,"“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",254
1011,"She is to betried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”",254
1012,This speech calmed me.,255
1013,"I was firmly convinced in my own mind thatJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",255
1014,"Ihad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could bebrought forward strong enough to convict her.",255
1015,My tale was not one toannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon asmadness by the vulgar.,255
1016,"Did any one indeed exist, except I, thecreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in theexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorancewhich I had let loose upon the world?",255
1017,We were soon joined by Elizabeth.,256
1018,Time had altered her since I lastbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty ofher childish years.,256
1019,"There was the same candour, the same vivacity, butit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.",256
1020,She welcomed me with the greatest affection.,256
1021,"“Your arrival, my dearcousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.",256
1022,You perhaps will find somemeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine.,256
1023,Alas!,256
1024,"who is safe, if shebe convicted of crime?",256
1025,I rely on her innocence as certainly as I doupon my own.,256

1030,“How kind and generous you are!,258

1037,During the whole ofthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.,262
1038,"It was tobe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices wouldcause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full ofinnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with everyaggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",262
1039,"Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promisedto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in anignominious grave, and I the cause!",262
1040,"A thousand times rather would Ihave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but Iwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would havebeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not haveexculpated her who suffered through me.",262
1041,The appearance of Justine was calm.,263
1042,"She was dressed in mourning, andher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of herfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.",263
1043,"Yet she appeared confident ininnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated bythousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise haveexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by theimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",263
1044,"Shewas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and asher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, sheworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.",263
1045,When she entered thecourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we wereseated.,263
1046,"A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quicklyrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attesther utter guiltlessness.",263
1047,"The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated thecharge, several witnesses were called.",264
1048,"Several strange facts combinedagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proofof her innocence as I had.",264
1049,She had been out the whole of the night onwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had beenperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of themurdered child had been afterwards found.,264
1050,"The woman asked her what shedid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confusedand unintelligible answer.",264
1051,"She returned to the house about eighto’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, shereplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestlyif anything had been heard concerning him.",264
1052,"When shown the body, shefell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.",264
1053,"Thepicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the samewhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed roundhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",264
1054,Justine was called on for her defence.,265
1055,"As the trial had proceeded, hercountenance had altered.",265
1056,"Surprise, horror, and misery were stronglyexpressed.",265
1057,"Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she wasdesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audiblealthough variable voice.",265
1058,"“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent.",266
1059,"But Ido not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocenceon a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adducedagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline myjudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appearsdoubtful or suspicious.”",266
1060,"She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passedthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at thehouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league fromGeneva.",267
1061,"On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who askedher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.",267
1062,"She wasalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remainseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, beingunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",267
1063,"Mostof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed thatshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.",267
1064,"It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavourto find my brother.",267
1065,"If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,it was without her knowledge.",267
1066,"That she had been bewildered whenquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passeda sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",267
1067,Concerning the picture she could give no account.,267
1068,"“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily andfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power ofexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only leftto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have beenplaced in my pocket.",268
1069,But here also I am checked.,268
1070,"I believe that I have noenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy mewantonly.",268
1071,Did the murderer place it there?,268
1072,"I know of no opportunityafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen thejewel, to part with it again so soon?",268
1073,"“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room forhope.",269
1074,"I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning mycharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposedguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on myinnocence.”",269
1075,"Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, andthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which theysupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to comeforward.",270
1076,"Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellentdispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to addressthe court.",270
1077,"“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child whowas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have livedwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth.",271
1078,"It maytherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, butwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of herpretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what Iknow of her character.",271
1079,I am well acquainted with the accused.,271
1080,"I have livedin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearlytwo years.",271
1081,During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable andbenevolent of human creatures.,271
1082,"She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, inher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwardsattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excitedthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in myuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",271
1083,She waswarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like amost affectionate mother.,271
1084,"For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and relyon her perfect innocence.",271
1085,"She had no temptation for such an action; as tothe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and valueher.”",271
1086,"A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerfulappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not infavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned withrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.",272
1087,"Sheherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",272
1088,My ownagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.,272
1089,I believedin her innocence; I knew it.,272
1090,Could the dæmon who had (I did not for aminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport havebetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?,272
1091,"I could not sustain thehorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice andthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,I rushed out of the court in agony.",272
1092,"The tortures of the accused didnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs ofremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.",272
1093,I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.,273
1094,In the morning I went tothe court; my lips and throat were parched.,273
1095,"I dared not ask the fatalquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of myvisit.",273
1096,"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justinewas condemned.",273
1097,I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.,274
1098,"I had beforeexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow uponthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of theheart-sickening despair that I then endured.",274
1099,The person to whom Iaddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.,274
1100,"“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring acase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like tocondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever sodecisive.”",274
1101,This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?,275
1102,Hadmy eyes deceived me?,275
1103,And was I really as mad as the whole world wouldbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?,275
1104,"Ihastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",275
1105,"“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; alljudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guiltyshould escape.",276
1106,But she has confessed.”,276
1107,"This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness uponJustine’s innocence.",277
1108,“Alas!” said she.,277
1109,“How shall Iever again believe in human goodness?,277
1110,"Justine, whom I loved and esteemed asmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?",277
1111,"Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she hascommitted a murder.”",277
1112,Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see mycousin.,278
1113,My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her ownjudgment and feelings to decide.,278
1114,"“Yes,” said Elizabeth,“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompanyme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yetI could not refuse.",278
1115,"We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on somestraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested onher knees.",279
1116,"She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone withher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",279
1117,Mycousin wept also.,279
1118,"“Oh, Justine!” said she.",280
1119,“Why did you rob me of my last consolation?,280
1120,"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, Iwas not so miserable as I am now.”",280
1121,"“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",281
1122,"Do you alsojoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Hervoice was suffocated with sobs.",281
1123,"“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,if you are innocent?",282
1124,"I am not one of your enemies, I believed youguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you hadyourself declared your guilt.",282
1125,"That report, you say, is false; and beassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for amoment, but your own confession.”",282
1126,"“I did confess, but I confessed a lie.",283
1127,"I confessed, that I mightobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart thanall my other sins.",283
1128,The God of heaven forgive me!,283
1129,"Ever since I wascondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said Iwas.",283
1130,He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments ifI continued obdurate.,283
1131,"Dear lady, I had none to support me; all lookedon me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",283
1132,What could I do?,283
1133,In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I trulymiserable.”,283
1134,"She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, mysweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessedaunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capableof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",284
1135,Dear William!,284
1136,dearest blessed child!,284
1137,"I soon shall see you again inheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as Iam to suffer ignominy and death.”",284
1138,"“Oh, Justine!",285
1139,Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.,285
1140,Why did you confess?,285
1141,"But do not mourn, dear girl.",285
1142,Do not fear.,285
1143,"Iwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence.",285
1144,I will melt the stonyhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.,285
1145,You shall not die!,285
1146,"You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!",285
1147,No!,285
1148,No!,285
1149,I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”,285
1150,Justine shook her head mournfully.,286
1151,"“I do not fear to die,” she said;“that pang is past.",286
1152,God raises my weakness and gives me courage toendure the worst.,286
1153,"I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you rememberme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to thefate awaiting me.",286
1154,"Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience tothe will of heaven!”",286
1155,"During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",287
1156,Despair!,287
1157,Who dared talk of that?,287
1158,"The poor victim, who on the morrow was to passthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, suchdeep and bitter agony.",287
1159,"I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.",287
1160,Justine started.,287
1161,"Whenshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are verykind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”",287
1162,I could not answer.,288
1163,"“No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is moreconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that youhad confessed, he did not credit it.”",288
1164,“I truly thank him.,289
1165,In these last moments I feel the sincerestgratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.,289
1166,How sweet isthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am!,289
1167,"It removes more thanhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that myinnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”",289
1168,Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.,290
1169,She indeedgained the resignation she desired.,290
1170,"But I, the true murderer, felt thenever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope orconsolation.",290
1171,"Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also wasthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fairmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.",290
1172,Anguish anddespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell withinme which nothing could extinguish.,290
1173,"We stayed several hours withJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tearherself away.",290
1174,"“I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; Icannot live in this world of misery.”",290
1175,"Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficultyrepressed her bitter tears.",291
1176,"She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voiceof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless andpreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will eversuffer!",291
1177,"Live, and be happy, and make others so.”",291
1178,And on the morrow Justine died.,292
1179,Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquencefailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in thecriminality of the saintly sufferer.,292
1180,My passionate and indignantappeals were lost upon them.,292
1181,"And when I received their cold answersand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposedavowal died away on my lips.",292
1182,"Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.",292
1183,Sheperished on the scaffold as a murderess!,292
1184,"From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep andvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth.",293
1185,This also was my doing!,293
1186,"And myfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all wasthe work of my thrice-accursed hands!",293
1187,"Ye weep, unhappy ones, but theseare not your last tears!",293
1188,"Again shall you raise the funeral wail, andthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!",293
1189,"Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; hewho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has nothought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dearcountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his lifein serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyondhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destructionpause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!",293
1190,"Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William andJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.",294
1191,Chapter 9,296
1192,"Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings havebeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness ofinaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hopeand fear.",297
1193,"Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.",297
1194,"The blood flowedfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on myheart which nothing could remove.",297
1195,"Sleep fled from my eyes; I wanderedlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyonddescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yetbehind.",297
1196,Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.,297
1197,I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the momentwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellowbeings.,297
1198,"Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of consciencewhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, andfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse andthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense torturessuch as no language can describe.",297
1199,"This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps neverentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.",298
1200,"I shunnedthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.",298
1201,My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my dispositionand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of hisserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude andawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.,299
1202,"“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not sufferalso?",299
1203,No one could love a child more than I loved yourbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“butis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmentingtheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?,299
1204,"It is also a dutyowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit forsociety.”",299
1205,"This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; Ishould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends ifremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with myother sensations.",300
1206,Now I could only answer my father with a look ofdespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.,300
1207,About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.,301
1208,This change wasparticularly agreeable to me.,301
1209,The shutting of the gates regularly atten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after thathour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksometo me.,301
1210,I was now free.,301
1211,"Often, after the rest of the family hadretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon thewater.",301
1212,"Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; andsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat topursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",301
1213,"Iwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the onlyunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful andheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh andinterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the watersmight close over me and my calamities for ever.",301
1214,"But I was restrained,when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderlyloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.",301
1215,I thought also of myfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave themexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let looseamong them?,301
1216,At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit mymind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.,302
1217,But thatcould not be.,302
1218,Remorse extinguished every hope.,302
1219,"I had been the author ofunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I hadcreated should perpetrate some new wickedness.",302
1220,"I had an obscure feelingthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.",302
1221,There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remainedbehind.,302
1222,My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived.,302
1223,"When I thought ofhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished toextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed.",302
1224,"When Ireflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all boundsof moderation.",302
1225,"I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of theAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base.",302
1226,"I wishedto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on hishead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.",302
1227,Our house was the house of mourning.,303
1228,My father’s health was deeplyshaken by the horror of the recent events.,303
1229,Elizabeth was sad anddesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; allpleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears shethen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blastedand destroyed.,303
1230,She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youthwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of ourfuture prospects.,303
1231,"The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us fromthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearestsmiles.",303
1232,"“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death ofJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they beforeappeared to me.",304
1233,"Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice andinjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancientdays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar toreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and menappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.",304
1234,Yet I amcertainly unjust.,304
1235,"Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; andif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredlyshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures.",304
1236,"For the sakeof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as ifit had been her own!",304
1237,"I could not consent to the death of any humanbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit toremain in the society of men.",304
1238,But she was innocent.,304
1239,"I know, I feelshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.",304
1240,Alas!,304
1241,"Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who canassure themselves of certain happiness?",304
1242,"I feel as if I were walking onthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding andendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",304
1243,"William and Justine wereassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,and perhaps respected.",304
1244,"But even if I were condemned to suffer on thescaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such awretch.”",304
1245,I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.,305
1246,"I, not in deed,but in effect, was the true murderer.",305
1247,"Elizabeth read my anguish in mycountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, youmust calm yourself.",305
1248,"These events have affected me, God knows howdeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.",305
1249,"There is an expression ofdespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes metremble.",305
1250,"Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.",305
1251,"Remember thefriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.",305
1252,Have we lostthe power of rendering you happy?,305
1253,Ah!,305
1254,"While we love, while we aretrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your nativecountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb ourpeace?”",305
1255,And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before everyother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in myheart?,306
1256,"Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest atthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.",306
1257,"Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor ofheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love wereineffectual.",307
1258,I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficialinfluence could penetrate.,307
1259,"The wounded deer dragging its faintinglimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which hadpierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.",307
1260,"Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, butsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodilyexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerablesensations.",308
1261,"It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly leftmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, soughtin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself andmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows.",308
1262,My wanderings were directedtowards the valley of Chamounix.,308
1263,I had visited it frequently during myboyhood.,308
1264,"Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but noughthad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.",308
1265,I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.,309
1266,"I afterwardshired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receiveinjury on these rugged roads.",309
1267,"The weather was fine; it was about themiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death ofJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.",309
1268,Theweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper inthe ravine of Arve.,309
1269,"The immense mountains and precipices that overhungme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, andthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty asOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being lessalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, heredisplayed in their most terrific guise.",309
1270,"Still, as I ascended higher,the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",309
1271,"Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, theimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth fromamong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.",309
1272,"But it wasaugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white andshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to anotherearth, the habitations of another race of beings.",309
1273,"I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the riverforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain thatoverhangs it.",310
1274,"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.",310
1275,"Thisvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful andpicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.",310
1276,"Thehigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw nomore ruined castles and fertile fields.",310
1277,Immense glaciers approachedthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche andmarked the smoke of its passage.,310
1278,"Mont Blanc, the supreme andmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.",310
1279,A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during thisjourney.,311
1280,"Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived andrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with thelighthearted gaiety of boyhood.",311
1281,"The very winds whispered in soothingaccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.",311
1282,Then again thekindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to griefand indulging in all the misery of reflection.,311
1283,"Then I spurred on myanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself onthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.",311
1284,At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.,312
1285,Exhaustion succeededto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.,312
1286,"For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallidlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing ofthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.",312
1287,"The same lulling soundsacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my headupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessedthe giver of oblivion.",312
1288,Chapter 10,314
1289,I spent the following day roaming through the valley.,315
1290,"I stood besidethe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, thatwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills tobarricade the valley.",315
1291,"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were beforeme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines werescattered around; and the solemn silence of this gloriouspresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawlingwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of theavalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of theaccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything intheir hands.",315
1292,These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me thegreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.,315
1293,"They elevated mefrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove mygrief, they subdued and tranquillised it.",315
1294,"In some degree, also, theydiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for thelast month.",315
1295,"I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which Ihad contemplated during the day.",315
1296,"They congregated round me; theunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they allgathered round me and bade me be at peace.",315
1297,Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?,316
1298,"All ofsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded everythought.",316
1299,"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid thesummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of thosemighty friends.",316
1300,Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek themin their cloudy retreats.,316
1301,What were rain and storm to me?,316
1302,"My mule wasbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit ofMontanvert.",316
1303,I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendousand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.,316
1304,It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to thesoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.,316
1305,The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always theeffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passingcares of life.,316
1306,"I determined to go without a guide, for I was wellacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy thesolitary grandeur of the scene.",316
1307,"The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and shortwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of themountain.",317
1308,It is a scene terrifically desolate.,317
1309,"In a thousand spotsthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees liebroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely uponother trees.",317
1310,"The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravinesof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them isparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speakingin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to drawdestruction upon the head of the speaker.",317
1311,"The pines are not tall orluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.",317
1312,"I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the riverswhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the oppositemountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rainpoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression Ireceived from the objects around me.",317
1313,Alas!,317
1314,Why does man boast ofsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only rendersthem more necessary beings.,317
1315,"If our impulses were confined to hunger,thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved byevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word mayconvey to us.",317
1316,  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.,318
1317,We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.,318
1318,"We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,     The path of its departure still is free.",318
1319,Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;     Nought may endure but mutability!,318
1320,It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.,319
1321,For sometime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.,319
1322,A mist coveredboth that and the surrounding mountains.,319
1323,"Presently a breeze dissipatedthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",319
1324,"The surface is veryuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, andinterspersed by rifts that sink deep.",319
1325,"The field of ice is almost aleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",319
1326,Theopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.,319
1327,"From the side where Inow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.",319

1422,"Bydegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that Iwas obliged to shut my eyes.",334
1423,"Darkness then came over me and troubledme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I nowsuppose, the light poured in upon me again.",334
1424,"I walked and, I believe,descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",334
1425,"Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to mytouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, withno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",334
1426,"The lightbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as Iwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.",334
1427,"This was theforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook restingfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",334
1428,"Thisroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which Ifound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.",334
1429,"I slaked my thirstat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",334
1430,"“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as itwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",335
1431,"Before I had quittedyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with someclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews ofnight.",335
1432,"I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and coulddistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I satdown and wept.",335
1433,“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation ofpleasure.,336
1434,I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among thetrees.,336
1435,[The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder.,336
1436,"It moved slowly,but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.",336
1437,"I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, withwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",336
1438,No distinctideas occupied my mind; all was confused.,336
1439,"I felt light, and hunger,and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and onall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I coulddistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that withpleasure.",336
1440,"“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night hadgreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from eachother.",337
1441,I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me withdrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.,337
1442,"I was delightedwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted myears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who hadoften intercepted the light from my eyes.",337
1443,"I began also to observe,with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive theboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",337
1444,Sometimes Itried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.,337
1445,"Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but theuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me intosilence again.",337
1446,"“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessenedform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",338
1447,"Mysensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received everyday additional ideas.",338
1448,"My eyes became accustomed to the light and toperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect fromthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.",338
1449,"I found that thesparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird andthrush were sweet and enticing.",338
1450,"“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had beenleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at thewarmth I experienced from it.",339
1451,"In my joy I thrust my hand into the liveembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",339
1452,"How strange,I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",339
1453,"Iexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to becomposed of wood.",339
1454,"I quickly collected some branches, but they were wetand would not burn.",339
1455,I was pained at this and sat still watching theoperation of the fire.,339
1456,The wet wood which I had placed near the heatdried and itself became inflamed.,339
1457,"I reflected on this, and by touchingthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself incollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have aplentiful supply of fire.",339
1458,"When night came on and brought sleep withit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",339
1459,"Icovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branchesupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sankinto sleep.",339
1460,"“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",340
1461,"I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",340
1462,"Iobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused theembers when they were nearly extinguished.",340
1463,"When night came again Ifound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and thatthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I foundsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, andtasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",340
1464,"Itried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it onthe live embers.",340
1465,"I found that the berries were spoiled by thisoperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.",340
1466,"“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole daysearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",341
1467,"WhenI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hithertoinhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would bemore easily satisfied.",341
1468,In this emigration I exceedingly lamented theloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not howto reproduce it.,341
1469,"I gave several hours to the serious consideration ofthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supplyit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the woodtowards the setting sun.",341
1470,I passed three days in these rambles and atlength discovered the open country.,341
1471,"A great fall of snow had takenplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; theappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the colddamp substance that covered the ground.",341
1472,"“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food andshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, whichhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",342
1473,"Thiswas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with greatcuriosity.",342
1474,"Finding the door open, I entered.",342
1475,"An old man sat in it,near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.",342
1476,"He turned onhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting thehut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated formhardly appeared capable.",342
1477,"His appearance, different from any I had everbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.",342
1478,But I was enchantedby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could notpenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisiteand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hellafter their sufferings in the lake of fire.,342
1479,"I greedily devoured theremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.",342
1480,"Then, overcome byfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.",342
1481,"“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, whichshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence mytravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in awallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, untilat sunset I arrived at a village.",343
1482,How miraculous did this appear!,343
1483,"Thehuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration byturns.",343
1484,"The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I sawplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",343
1485,"Oneof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot withinthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",343
1486,"The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, Iescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I hadbeheld in the village.",343
1487,"This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neatand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, Idared not enter it.",343
1488,"My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but solow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",343
1489,"No wood, however,was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; andalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it anagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",343
1490,"“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still morefrom the barbarity of man.",344
1491,"As soon as morning dawned I crept from mykennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I couldremain in the habitation I had found.",344
1492,It was situated against the backof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pigsty and a clear pool of water.,344
1493,"One part was open, and by that I hadcrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceivedwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them onoccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, andthat was sufficient for me.",344
1494,"“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, Iretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I rememberedtoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.",345
1495,"Ihad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loafof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drinkmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed bymy retreat.",345
1496,"The floor was a little raised, so that it was keptperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it wastolerably warm.",345
1497,"“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel untilsomething should occur which might alter my determination.",346
1498,"It wasindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",346
1499,"I ate my breakfast withpleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a littlewater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I behelda young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",346
1500,"Thegirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since foundcottagers and farmhouse servants to be.",346
1501,"Yet she was meanly dressed, acoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fairhair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad.",346
1502,"I lostsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearingthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",346
1503,"As she walked along,seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whosecountenance expressed a deeper despondence.",346
1504,"Uttering a few sounds withan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to thecottage himself.",346
1505,"She followed, and they disappeared.",346
1506,"Presently I sawthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the fieldbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in thehouse and sometimes in the yard.",346
1507,"“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of thecottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had beenfilled up with wood.",347
1508,In one of these was a small and almostimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.,347
1509,"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and cleanbut very bare of furniture.",347
1510,"In one corner, near a small fire, sat anold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",347
1511,"Theyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently shetook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she satdown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to playand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or thenightingale.",347
1512,"It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who hadnever beheld aught beautiful before.",347
1513,"The silver hair and benevolentcountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentlemanners of the girl enticed my love.",347
1514,"He played a sweet mournful airwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, ofwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he thenpronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, kneltat his feet.",347
1515,"He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affectionthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they werea mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from thewindow, unable to bear these emotions.",347
1516,"“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders aload of wood.",348
1517,"The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him ofhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it onthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",348
1518,"She seemedpleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which sheplaced in water, and then upon the fire.",348
1519,"She afterwards continued herwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busilyemployed in digging and pulling up roots.",348
1520,"After he had been employedthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered thecottage together.",348
1521,"“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearanceof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down toeat.",349
1522,The meal was quickly dispatched.,349
1523,"The young woman was againoccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before thecottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",349
1524,Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellentcreatures.,349
1525,"One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beamingwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in hisfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet hiseyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",349
1526,"Theold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools differentfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across thefields.",349
1527,"“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that thecottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and wasdelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to thepleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",350
1528,In the eveningthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupationswhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up theinstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me inthe morning.,350
1529,"So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling theharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I sincefound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of thescience of words or letters.",350
1530,"“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”",351

1532,"“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",354
1533,I thought of theoccurrences of the day.,354
1534,"What chiefly struck me was the gentle mannersof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.",354
1535,"Iremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before fromthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct Imight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I wouldremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover themotives which influenced their actions.",354
1536,“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.,355
1537,"The young womanarranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departedafter the first meal.",355
1538,“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.,356
1539,"The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl invarious laborious occupations within.",356
1540,"The old man, whom I soonperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument orin contemplation.",356
1541,Nothing could exceed the love and respect which theyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.,356
1542,"Theyperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty withgentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",356
1543,“They were not entirely happy.,357
1544,The young man and his companion oftenwent apart and appeared to weep.,357
1545,"I saw no cause for their unhappiness,but I was deeply affected by it.",357
1546,"If such lovely creatures weremiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,should be wretched.",357
1547,Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?,357
1548,"Theypossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and everyluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viandswhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each daylooks of affection and kindness.",357
1549,What did their tears imply?,357
1550,Did theyreally express pain?,357
1551,"I was at first unable to solve these questions,but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances whichwere at first enigmatic.",357
1552,"“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes ofthe uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and theysuffered that evil in a very distressing degree.",358
1553,"Their nourishmentconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk ofone cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masterscould scarcely procure food to support it.",358
1554,"They often, I believe,suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the twoyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the oldman when they reserved none for themselves.",358
1555,“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.,359
1556,"I had been accustomed,during the night, to steal a part of their store for my ownconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain onthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, androots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.",359
1557,“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assisttheir labours.,360
1558,"I found that the youth spent a great part of each dayin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I oftentook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought homefiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",360
1559,"“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when sheopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a greatpile of wood on the outside.",361
1560,"She uttered some words in a loud voice, and theyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",361
1561,"I observed, with pleasure,that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing thecottage and cultivating the garden.",361
1562,“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.,362
1563,I found thatthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience andfeelings to one another by articulate sounds.,362
1564,"I perceived that the wordsthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in theminds and countenances of the hearers.",362
1565,"This was indeed a godlike science,and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",362
1566,But I was baffled inevery attempt I made for this purpose.,362
1567,"Their pronunciation was quick, andthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visibleobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel themystery of their reference.",362
1568,"By great application, however, and after havingremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, Idiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects ofdiscourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.",362
1569,"The youthand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had onlyone, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_.",362
1570,I cannotdescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each ofthese sounds and was able to pronounce them.,362
1571,"I distinguished several otherwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,dearest, unhappy._",362
1572,“I spent the winter in this manner.,363
1573,"The gentle manners and beauty ofthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, Ifelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.",363
1574,"I sawfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter thecottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me thesuperior accomplishments of my friends.",363
1575,"The old man, I could perceive,often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found thathe called them, to cast off their melancholy.",363
1576,"He would talk in acheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasureeven upon me.",363
1577,"Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filledwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but Igenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful afterhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.",363
1578,It was not thuswith Felix.,363
1579,"He was always the saddest of the group, and even to myunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than hisfriends.",363
1580,"But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was morecheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the oldman.",363
1581,"“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, markedthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",364
1582,"In the midst of povertyand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first littlewhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",364
1583,"Early inthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow thatobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, andbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetualastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisiblehand.",364
1584,"In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouringfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,yet brought no wood with him.",364
1585,"At other times he worked in the garden,but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the oldman and Agatha.",364
1586,"“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees Idiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as whenhe talked.",365
1587,"I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signsfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehendthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understandthe sounds for which they stood as signs?",365
1588,"I improved, however,sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind ofconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for Ieasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself tothe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first becomemaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make themoverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrastperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",365
1589,"“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myselfin a transparent pool!",366
1590,"At first I started back, unable to believe thatit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I becamefully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I wasfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",366
1591,Alas!,366
1592,I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserabledeformity.,366
1593,"“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snowvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",367
1594,"From thistime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications ofimpending famine disappeared.",367
1595,"Their food, as I afterwards found, wascoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",367
1596,"Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which theydressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the seasonadvanced.",367
1597,"“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it didnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth itswaters.",368
1598,"This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried theearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",368
1599,“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.,369
1600,"During the morning Iattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed invarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent inobserving my friends.",369
1601,"When they had retired to rest, if there was anymoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collectedmy own food and fuel for the cottage.",369
1602,"When I returned, as often as itwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed thoseoffices that I had seen done by Felix.",369
1603,"I afterwards found that theselabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; andonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _goodspirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the significationof these terms.",369
1604,"“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover themotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive toknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.",370
1605,I thought(foolish wretch!),370
1606,that it might be in my power to restore happiness tothese deserving people.,370
1607,"When I slept or was absent, the forms of thevenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felixflitted before me.",370
1608,I looked upon them as superior beings who would bethe arbiters of my future destiny.,370
1609,"I formed in my imagination athousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception ofme.",370
1610,"I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentledemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour andafterwards their love.",370
1611,“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour tothe acquiring the art of language.,371
1612,"My organs were indeed harsh, butsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of theirtones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",371
1613,"It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whoseintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deservedbetter treatment than blows and execration.",371
1614,“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered theaspect of the earth.,372

1625,Mysenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight anda thousand sights of beauty.,376
1626,"“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically restedfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the childrenlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix wasmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his fatherpaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquiredthe cause of his son’s sorrow.",377
1627,"Felix replied in a cheerful accent, andthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.",377
1628,"“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.",378

1631,Her voice wasmusical but unlike that of either of my friends.,378
1632,"On hearing this word,Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up herveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",378
1633,"Herhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes weredark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regularproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged witha lovely pink.",378
1634,"“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait ofsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree ofecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; hiseyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment Ithought him as beautiful as the stranger.",379
1635,"She appeared affected bydifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she heldout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, aswell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",379
1636,"She did not appear tounderstand him, but smiled.",379
1637,"He assisted her to dismount, anddismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.",379
1638,"Someconversation took place between him and his father, and the youngstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.",379
1639,"“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate soundsand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understoodby nor herself understood the cottagers.",380
1640,"They made many signs which Idid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladnessthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates themorning mists.",380
1641,Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles ofdelight welcomed his Arabian.,380

1643,"Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.",380
1644,"Presently Ifound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the strangerrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of thesame instructions to the same end.",380
1645,"The stranger learned about twentywords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I hadbefore understood, but I profited by the others.",380
1646,"“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",381
1647,"When theyseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good nightsweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, andby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovelyguest was the subject of their conversation.",381
1648,"I ardently desired tounderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but foundit utterly impossible.",381
1649,"“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usualoccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of theold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancinglybeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from myeyes.",382
1650,"She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling ordying away like a nightingale of the woods.",382
1651,"“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at firstdeclined it.",383
1652,"She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it insweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",383

1654,"“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alterationthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",384
1655,"Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in theknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend mostof the words uttered by my protectors.",384
1656,"“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, andthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to thescent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnalrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerablyshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I neverventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the sametreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.",385
1657,"“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedilymaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly thanthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in brokenaccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word thatwas spoken.",386
1658,"“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters asit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide fieldfor wonder and delight.",387
1659,“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruinsof Empires_.,388
1660,"I should not have understood the purport of this book had notFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",388
1661,"He had chosen thiswork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of theEastern authors.",388
1662,"Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of historyand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gaveme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the differentnations of the earth.",388
1663,"I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendousgenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtueof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of thedecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings.",388
1664,I heardof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over thehapless fate of its original inhabitants.,388

1672,"Iheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalidpoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.",390
1673,“The words induced me to turn towards myself.,391

1687,"I admired virtue and goodfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of mycottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, exceptthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen andunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had ofbecoming one among my fellows.",393

1747,"“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where Idiscovered them.",413
1748,"Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, forwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, ondiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy withhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.",413
1749,"“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and renderedhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",414
1750,"He couldhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of hisvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the lossof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.",414
1751,Thearrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.,414
1752,"“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealthand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of herlover, but to prepare to return to her native country.",415
1753,"The generousnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted toexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating histyrannical mandate.",415
1754,"“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and toldher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghornhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to theFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him toConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",416
1755,"Heintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidentialservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of hisproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.",416
1756,"“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that itwould become her to pursue in this emergency.",417
1757,A residence in Turkeywas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averseto it.,417
1758,By some papers of her father which fell into her hands sheheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot wherehe then resided.,417
1759,"She hesitated some time, but at length she formed herdetermination.",417
1760,"Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and asum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed forGermany.",417
1761,"“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottageof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed herwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and theArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the countryand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",418
1762,"She fell, however,into good hands.",418
1763,"The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot forwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house inwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety atthe cottage of her lover.”",418
1764,Chapter 15,420
1765,“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.,421
1766,It impressed me deeply.,421
1767,"I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admiretheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",421
1768,"“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence andgenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire tobecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualitieswere called forth and displayed.",422
1769,"But in giving an account of theprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurredin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.",422
1770,"“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where Icollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found onthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress andsome books.",423
1771,I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.,423
1772,"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which Ihad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volumeof _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_.",423
1773,"Thepossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continuallystudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends wereemployed in their ordinary occupations.",423
1774,“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.,424
1775,"They producedin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised meto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",424
1776,"Inthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affectingstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown uponwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it anever-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",424
1777,"The gentle anddomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments andfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accordedwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants whichwere for ever alive in my own bosom.",424
1778,"But I thought Werter himself amore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his charactercontained no pretension, but it sank deep.",424
1779,The disquisitions upondeath and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.,424
1780,"I did notpretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towardsthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without preciselyunderstanding it.",424
1781,"“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings andcondition.",425
1782,I found myself similar yet at the same time strangelyunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation Iwas a listener.,425
1783,"I sympathised with and partly understood them, but Iwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.",425
1784,"‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament myannihilation.",425
1785,My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.,425
1786,What didthis mean?,425
1787,Who was I?,425
1788,What was I?,425
1789,Whence did I come?,425
1790,What was mydestination?,425
1791,"These questions continually recurred, but I was unable tosolve them.",425
1792,“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained thehistories of the first founders of the ancient republics.,426
1793,This bookhad a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.,426
1794,"Ilearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarchtaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of myown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",426
1795,Manythings I read surpassed my understanding and experience.,426
1796,"I had a veryconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,and boundless seas.",426
1797,But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns andlarge assemblages of men.,426
1798,"The cottage of my protectors had been theonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this bookdeveloped new and mightier scenes of action.",426
1799,"I read of men concernedin public affairs, governing or massacring their species.",426
1800,"I felt thegreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, asfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as theywere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.",426
1801,"Induced by thesefeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.",426
1802,"Thepatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take afirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity hadbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I shouldhave been imbued with different sensations.",426
1803,“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.,427
1804,"I readit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, asa true history.",427
1805,It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that thepicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable ofexciting.,427
1806,"I often referred the several situations, as their similaritystruck me, to my own.",427
1807,"Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link toany other being in existence; but his state was far different from minein every other respect.",427
1808,"He had come forth from the hands of God aperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care ofhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge frombeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",427
1809,"Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, foroften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bittergall of envy rose within me.",427
1810,“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.,428
1811,Soonafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket ofthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory.,428
1812,"At first I hadneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters inwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",428
1813,It wasyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation.,428
1814,Youminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progressof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domesticoccurrences.,428
1815,You doubtless recollect these papers.,428
1816,Here they are.,428
1817,"Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursedorigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstanceswhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odiousand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your ownhorrors and rendered mine indelible.",428
1818,I sickened as I read.,428
1819,‘Hatefulday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony.,428
1820,‘Accursed creator!,428
1821,Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me indisgust?,428
1822,"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his ownimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from thevery resemblance.",428
1823,"Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admireand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’",428
1824,"“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable andbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they shouldbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they wouldcompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.",429
1825,"Could they turnfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassionand friendship?",429
1826,"I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every wayto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.",429
1827,"Ipostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importanceattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",429
1828,"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with everyday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertakinguntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.",429
1829,"“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.",430
1830,"Thepresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I alsofound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",430
1831,"Felix and Agathaspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted intheir labours by servants.",430
1832,"They did not appear rich, but they werecontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, whilemine became every day more tumultuous.",430
1833,Increase of knowledge onlydiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.,430
1834,"Icherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my personreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frailimage and that inconstant shade.",430
1835,"“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trialwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed mythoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, anddared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with myfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathedsmiles of consolation.",431
1836,But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed mysorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.,431
1837,I remembered Adam’ssupplication to his Creator.,431
1838,But where was mine?,431
1839,"He had abandoned me,and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.",431
1840,“Autumn passed thus.,432
1841,"I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decayand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance ithad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",432
1842,Yet I didnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by myconformation for the endurance of cold than heat.,432
1843,"But my chiefdelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gayapparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attentiontowards the cottagers.",432
1844,Their happiness was not decreased by theabsence of summer.,432
1845,"They loved and sympathised with one another; andtheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by thecasualties that took place around them.",432
1846,"The more I saw of them, thegreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; myheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to seetheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmostlimit of my ambition.",432
1847,I dared not think that they would turn them fromme with disdain and horror.,432
1848,The poor that stopped at their door werenever driven away.,432
1849,"I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than alittle food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did notbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.",432
1850,"“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had takenplace since I awoke into life.",433
1851,My attention at this time was solelydirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of myprotectors.,433
1852,"I revolved many projects, but that on which I finallyfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",433
1853,I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of myperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerlybeheld me.,433
1854,"My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; Ithought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gainthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his meansbe tolerated by my younger protectors.",433
1855,"“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the groundand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his owndesire, was left alone in the cottage.",434
1856,"When his children had departed,he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, moresweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",434
1857,"At first hiscountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside theinstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",434
1858,"“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, whichwould decide my hopes or realise my fears.",435
1859,The servants were gone to aneighbouring fair.,435
1860,"All was silent in and around the cottage; it was anexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, mylimbs failed me and I sank to the ground.",435
1861,"Again I rose, and exertingall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I hadplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",435
1862,"The fresh air revivedme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of theircottage.",435
1863,“I knocked.,436

2134,I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the variousarguments which he had employed.,514

2192,I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapableof offering any reply.,530
2193,I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude ofthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.,530
2194,Alas!,530
2195,To methe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror anddismay.,530
2196,"I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilledand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might notimpend over me and my devoted family!",530
2197,Could I enter into a festivalwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to theground?,530
2198,I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart withhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union fromwhich I expected peace.,530
2199,I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying toEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophersof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensableuse to me in my present undertaking.,531
2200,"The latter method of obtainingthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, Ihad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in myloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiarintercourse with those I loved.",531
2201,"I knew that a thousand fearfulaccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale tothrill all connected with me with horror.",531
2202,"I was aware also that Ishould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding theharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of myunearthly occupation.",531
2203,I must absent myself from all I loved while thusemployed.,531
2204,"Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might berestored to my family in peace and happiness.",531
2205,"My promise fulfilled,the monster would depart for ever.",531
2206,Or (so my fond fancy imaged) someaccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to myslavery for ever.,531
2207,These feelings dictated my answer to my father.,532
2208,"I expressed a wish tovisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, Iclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while Iurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father tocomply.",532
2209,"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy thatresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to findthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before myreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.",532
2210,"The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, orat most a year, was the period contemplated.",533
2211,One paternal kindprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.,533
2212,"Withoutpreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.",533
2213,"This interferedwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at thecommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way bean impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved manyhours of lonely, maddening reflection.",533
2214,"Nay, Henry might stand betweenme and the intrusion of my foe.",533
2215,"If I were alone, would he not at timesforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or tocontemplate its progress?",533
2216,"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my unionwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.",534
2217,My father’sage rendered him extremely averse to delay.,534
2218,"For myself, there was onereward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for myunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth andforget the past in my union with her.",534
2219,"I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted mewhich filled me with fear and agitation.",535
2220,"During my absence I shouldleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy andunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by mydeparture.",535
2221,"But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, andwould he not accompany me to England?",535
2222,"This imagination was dreadful initself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",535
2223,I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse ofthis might happen.,535
2224,But through the whole period during which I was theslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses ofthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiendwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of hismachinations.,535
2225,It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my nativecountry.,536
2226,"My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeththerefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea ofmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.",536
2227,It hadbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a manis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’ssedulous attention.,536
2228,"She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousandconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silentfarewell.",536
2229,"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardlyknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",537
2230,"I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected onit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go withme.",537
2231,"Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautifuland majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.",537
2232,I couldonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupyme whilst they endured.,537
2233,"After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversedmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days forClerval.",538
2234,He came.,538
2235,"Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",538
2236,"Hewas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of thesetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a newday.",538
2237,He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape andthe appearances of the sky.,538
2238,"“This is what it is to live,” he cried;“now I enjoy existence!",538
2239,"But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore areyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomythoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the goldensunrise reflected in the Rhine.",538
2240,"And you, my friend, would be far moreamused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with aneye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.",538
2241,"I, amiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue toenjoyment.",538
2242,"We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh toRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",539
2243,During thisvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.,539
2244,"We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure fromStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz.",539
2245,The course of the Rhine below Mainzbecomes much more picturesque.,539
2246,"The river descends rapidly and windsbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",539
2247,"We sawmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded byblack woods, high and inaccessible.",539
2248,"This part of the Rhine, indeed,presents a singularly variegated landscape.",539
2249,"In one spot you viewrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, withthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering riverand populous towns occupy the scene.",539
2250,We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourersas we glided down the stream.,540
2251,"Even I, depressed in mind, and my spiritscontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",540
2252,"I lay at thebottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed todrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger.",540
2253,"And if thesewere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?",540
2254,He felt as if he hadbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted byman.,540
2255,"“I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenesof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where thesnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting blackand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearancewere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gayappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind toreup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must beon the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche andwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of thenightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",540
2256,"Themountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is acharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.",540
2257,"Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on theisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and nowthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that villagehalf hid in the recess of the mountain.",540
2258,"Oh, surely the spirit that inhabitsand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those whopile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains ofour own country.”",540
2259,Clerval!,541
2260,Beloved friend!,541
2261,Even now it delights me to record your words andto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving.,541
2262,He was abeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild andenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.,541
2263,"Hissoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of thatdevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for onlyin the imagination.",541
2264,But even human sympathies were not sufficient tosatisfy his eager mind.,541
2265,"The scenery of external nature, which others regardonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—",541
2266,"    ——The sounding cataract    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,    Their colours and their forms, were then to him    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,    That had no need of a remoter charm,    By thought supplied, or any interest    Unborrow’d from the eye.",542
2267,          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.],543
2268,And where does he now exist?,544
2269,Is this gentle and lovely being lostfor ever?,544
2270,"Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fancifuland magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on thelife of its creator;—has this mind perished?",544
2271,Does it now only existin my memory?,544
2272,"No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, andbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits andconsoles your unhappy friend.",544
2273,"Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slighttribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",545
2274,I willproceed with my tale.,545
2275,"Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved topost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream ofthe river was too gentle to aid us.",546
2276,"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but wearrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.",547
2277,"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first sawthe white cliffs of Britain.",547
2278,"The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by theremembrance of some story.",547
2279,"We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the SpanishArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heardof even in my country.",547
2280,"At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s toweringabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.",548
2281,Chapter 19,550
2282,London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain severalmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city.,551
2283,"Clerval desired theintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at thistime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principallyoccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for thecompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters ofintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the mostdistinguished natural philosophers.",551
2284,"If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",552
2285,"But a blight hadcome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake ofthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interestwas so terribly profound.",552
2286,"Company was irksome to me; when alone, Icould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice ofHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitorypeace.",552
2287,"But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair tomy heart.",552
2288,"I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and myfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William andJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filledmy soul with anguish.",552
2289,But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitiveand anxious to gain experience and instruction.,553
2290,The difference ofmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source ofinstruction and amusement.,553
2291,He was also pursuing an object he had longhad in view.,553
2292,"His design was to visit India, in the belief that he hadin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he hadtaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress ofEuropean colonization and trade.",553
2293,In Britain only could he further theexecution of his plan.,553
2294,"He was for ever busy, and the only check to hisenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.",553
2295,"I tried to conceal thisas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasuresnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed byany care or bitter recollection.",553
2296,"I often refused to accompany him,alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",553
2297,"I now alsobegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and thiswas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually fallingon the head.",553
2298,"Every thought that was devoted to it was an extremeanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lipsto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.",553
2299,"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person inScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",554
2300,"He mentioned thebeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficientallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,where he resided.",554
2301,"Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams andall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.",554
2302,"We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was nowFebruary.",555
2303,We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards thenorth at the expiration of another month.,555
2304,"In this expedition we did notintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion ofthis tour about the end of July.",555
2305,"I packed up my chemical instruments andthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in someobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",555
2306,"We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days atWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",556
2307,"This was a new scene to usmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds ofstately deer were all novelties to us.",556
2308,From thence we proceeded to Oxford.,557
2309,"As we entered this city, our mindswere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transactedthere more than a century and a half before.",557
2310,It was here that CharlesI. had collected his forces.,557
2311,"This city had remained faithful to him,after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard ofParliament and liberty.",557
2312,"The memory of that unfortunate king and hiscompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, andson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which theymight be supposed to have inhabited.",557
2313,"The spirit of elder days found adwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",557
2314,"If thesefeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance ofthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",557
2315,"The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almostmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadowsof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, anddomes, embosomed among aged trees.",557
2316,"I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by thememory of the past and the anticipation of the future.",558
2317,I was formedfor peaceful happiness.,558
2318,"During my youthful days discontent nevervisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of whatis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime inthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicateelasticity to my spirits.",558
2319,"But I am a blasted tree; the bolt hasentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit whatI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.",558
2320,"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environsand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the mostanimating epoch of English history.",559
2321,Our little voyages of discoverywere often prolonged by the successive objects that presentedthemselves.,559
2322,We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and thefield on which that patriot fell.,559
2323,For a moment my soul was elevatedfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideasof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monumentsand the remembrancers.,559
2324,"For an instant I dared to shake off my chainsand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eateninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into mymiserable self.",559
2325,"We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our nextplace of rest.",560
2326,"The country in the neighbourhood of this villageresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; buteverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown ofdistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of mynative country.",560
2327,"We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinetsof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the samemanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",560
2328,"The latter namemade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quitMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.",560
2329,"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months inCumberland and Westmorland.",561
2330,I could now almost fancy myself among theSwiss mountains.,561
2331,"The little patches of snow which yet lingered on thenorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of therocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.",561
2332,"Here also wemade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me intohappiness.",561
2333,"The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater thanmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he foundin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could haveimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with hisinferiors.",561
2334,"“I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and amongthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”",561
2335,But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much painamidst its enjoyments.,562
2336,"His feelings are for ever on the stretch; andwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quitthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which againengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",562
2337,"We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorlandand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the periodof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left themto travel on.",563
2338,For my own part I was not sorry.,563
2339,"I had now neglected mypromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’sdisappointment.",563
2340,He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeanceon my relatives.,563
2341,This idea pursued me and tormented me at every momentfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.,563
2342,"I waitedfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I wasmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and Isaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared toread and ascertain my fate.",563
2343,Sometimes I thought that the fiendfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.,563
2344,"When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage ofhis destroyer.",563
2345,"I felt as if I had committed some great crime, theconsciousness of which haunted me.",563
2346,"I was guiltless, but I had indeeddrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.",563
2347,I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city mighthave interested the most unfortunate being.,564
2348,"Clerval did not like it so wellas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.",564
2349,"But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romanticcastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’sSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him forthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",564
2350,But I wasimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.,564
2351,"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, andalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",565
2352,But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter intotheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; andaccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotlandalone.,565
2353,"“Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be ourrendezvous.",565
2354,"I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere withmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a shorttime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, morecongenial to your own temper.”",565
2355,"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased toremonstrate.",566
2356,He entreated me to write often.,566
2357,"“I had rather be withyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotchpeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do inyour absence.”",566
2358,"Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot ofScotland and finish my work in solitude.",567
2359,"I did not doubt but that themonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should havefinished, that he might receive his companion.",567
2360,With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one ofthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours.,568
2361,"It was a placefitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides werecontinually beaten upon by the waves.",568
2362,"The soil was barren, scarcelyaffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for itsinhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbsgave tokens of their miserable fare.",568
2363,"Vegetables and bread, when theyindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured fromthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.",568
2364,"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one ofthese was vacant when I arrived.",569
2365,This I hired.,569
2366,"It contained but tworooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserablepenury.",569
2367,"The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and thedoor was off its hinges.",569
2368,"I ordered it to be repaired, bought somefurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless haveoccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers beenbenumbed by want and squalid poverty.",569
2369,"As it was, I lived ungazed atand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clotheswhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensationsof men.",569
2370,"In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea tolisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.",570
2371,It was amonotonous yet ever-changing scene.,570
2372,I thought of Switzerland; it wasfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape.,570
2373,"Its hillsare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in theplains.",570
2374,"Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and whentroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a livelyinfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",570
2375,"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, butas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible andirksome to me.",571
2376,"Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter mylaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and nightin order to complete my work.",571
2377,"It was, indeed, a filthy process inwhich I was engaged.",571
2378,"During my first experiment, a kind ofenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; mymind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyeswere shut to the horror of my proceedings.",571
2379,"But now I went to it incold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.",571
2380,"Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed ina solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention fromthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; Igrew restless and nervous.",572
2381,Every moment I feared to meet mypersecutor.,572
2382,"Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearingto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so muchdreaded to behold.",572
2383,I feared to wander from the sight of my fellowcreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.,572
2384,"In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerablyadvanced.",573
2385,"I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eagerhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which wasintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sickenin my bosom.",573
2386,Chapter 20,575
2387,"I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was justrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and Iremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave mylabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attentionto it.",576
2388,"As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me toconsider the effects of what I was now doing.",576
2389,"Three years before, I wasengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleledbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterestremorse.",576
2390,"I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I wasalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than hermate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness.",576
2391,"He hadsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but shehad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking andreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before hercreation.",576
2392,"They might even hate each other; the creature who already livedloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrencefor it when it came before his eyes in the female form?",576
2393,"She also might turnwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of beingdeserted by one of his own species.",576
2394,"Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmonthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated uponthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man acondition precarious and full of terror.",577
2395,"Had I right, for my own benefit,to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",577
2396,"I had before been movedby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless byhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of mypromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse meas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace atthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.",577
2397,"I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw bythe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.",578
2398,"A ghastly grinwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the taskwhich he had allotted to me.",578
2399,"Yes, he had followed me in my travels; hehad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wideand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim thefulfilment of my promise.",578
2400,"As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent ofmalice and treachery.",579
2401,"I thought with a sensation of madness on mypromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.",579
2402,"The wretch saw medestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended forhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",579
2403,"I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my ownheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, Isought my own apartment.",580
2404,I was alone; none were near me to dissipatethe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the mostterrible reveries.,580
2405,"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all naturereposed under the eye of the quiet moon.",581
2406,"A few fishing vessels alonespecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the soundof voices as the fishermen called to one another.",581
2407,"I felt the silence,although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my earwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and aperson landed close to my house.",581
2408,"In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some oneendeavoured to open it softly.",582
2409,"I trembled from head to foot; I felt apresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants whodwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensationof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vainendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.",582
2410,"Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the dooropened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",583
2411,"Shutting the door, heapproached me and said in a smothered voice,",583
2412,“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that youintend?,584
2413,Do you dare to break your promise?,584
2414,"I have endured toil and misery;I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, amongits willow islands and over the summits of its hills.",584

2425,Begone!,587
2426,"I am firm, and yourwords will only exasperate my rage.”",587
2427,The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in theimpotence of anger.,588

2448,"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears.",593
2449,I burned with rage topursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean.,593
2450,"Iwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imaginationconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",593
2451,Why had I notfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife?,593
2452,"But I had suffered himto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland.",593
2453,I shudderedto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.,593
2454,"And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you onyour wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for thefulfilment of my destiny.",593
2455,In that hour I should die and at once satisfy andextinguish his malice.,593
2456,"The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when Ithought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when sheshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first Ihad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fallbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.",593
2457,"The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings becamecalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks intothe depths of despair.",594
2458,"I left the house, the horrid scene of the lastnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which Ialmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellowcreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me.",594
2459,"Idesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.",594
2460,"If I returned, it was tobe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of adæmon whom I had myself created.",594
2461,"I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all itloved and miserable in the separation.",595
2462,"When it became noon, and thesun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deepsleep.",595
2463,"I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerveswere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",595
2464,"The sleepinto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt asif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began toreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still thewords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appearedlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",595
2465,"The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying myappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw afishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me tojoin him.",596
2466,"He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly wherehe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desiredhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for hisIndian enterprise.",596
2467,"He could not any longer delay his departure; but ashis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he nowconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much ofmy society on him as I could spare.",596
2468,"He besought me, therefore, toleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceedsouthwards together.",596
2469,"This letter in a degree recalled me to life, andI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.",596
2470,"Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shudderedto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose Imust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I musthandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me.",597
2471,"The nextmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the doorof my laboratory.",597
2472,"The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I haddestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I hadmangled the living flesh of a human being.",597
2473,I paused to collect myself andthen entered the chamber.,597
2474,"With trembling hand I conveyed the instrumentsout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of mywork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordinglyput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying themup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in themeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging mychemical apparatus.",597
2475,Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken placein my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.,598
2476,"I hadbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, withwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a filmhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time sawclearly.",598
2477,"The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occurto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did notreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",598
2478,"I had resolved inmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first madewould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and Ibanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a differentconclusion.",598
2479,"Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting mybasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.",599
2480,"The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,but I sailed away from them.",599
2481,I felt as if I was about the commission of adreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with myfellow creatures.,599
2482,"At one time the moon, which had before been clear, wassuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment ofdarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling soundas it sank and then sailed away from the spot.",599
2483,"The sky became clouded, butthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was thenrising.",599
2484,"But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensationsthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in adirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.",599
2485,"Clouds hid themoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as itskeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time Islept soundly.",599
2486,"I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke Ifound that the sun had already mounted considerably.",600
2487,"The wind was high, andthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",600
2488,I foundthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast fromwhich I had embarked.,600
2489,I endeavoured to change my course but quickly foundthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled withwater.,600
2490,"Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind.",600
2491,Iconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror.,600
2492,I had no compass with meand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of theworld that the sun was of little benefit to me.,600
2493,I might be driven into thewide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up inthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.,600
2494,"I had alreadybeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude tomy other sufferings.",600
2495,"I looked on the heavens, which were covered by cloudsthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon thesea; it was to be my grave.",600
2496,"“Fiend,” I exclaimed, “yourtask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, andof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy hissanguinary and merciless passions.",600
2497,"This idea plunged me into a reverie sodespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point ofclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.",600
2498,"Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards thehorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea becamefree from breakers.",601
2499,"But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sickand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of highland towards the south.",601
2500,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I enduredfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood ofwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",602
2501,"How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we haveof life even in the excess of misery!",603
2502,I constructed another sail with apart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.,603
2503,"It had awild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceivedthe traces of cultivation.",603
2504,I saw vessels near the shore and found myselfsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.,603
2505,Icarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I atlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory.,603
2506,"As I was in a state ofextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a placewhere I could most easily procure nourishment.",603
2507,Fortunately I had money withme.,603
2508,"As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a goodharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpectedescape.",603
2509,"As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, severalpeople crowded towards the spot.",604
2510,"They seemed much surprised at myappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whisperedtogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in mea slight sensation of alarm.",604
2511,"As it was, I merely remarked that theyspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.",604
2512,"“Mygood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name ofthis town and inform me where I am?”",604
2513,"“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.",605
2514,"“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”",605
2515,"I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from astranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning andangry countenances of his companions.",606
2516,“Why do you answer me soroughly?” I replied.,606
2517,“Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen toreceive strangers so inhospitably.”,606
2518,"“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of theEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”",607
2519,"While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidlyincrease.",608
2520,"Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, whichannoyed and in some degree alarmed me.",608
2521,"I inquired the way to the inn, butno one replied.",608
2522,"I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from thecrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking manapproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you mustfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”",608
2523,“Who is Mr. Kirwin?,609
2524,Why am I to give an account of myself?,609
2525,Is notthis a free country?”,609
2526,"“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.",610
2527,"Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who wasfound murdered here last night.”",610
2528,"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself.",611
2529,I was innocent;that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silenceand was led to one of the best houses in the town.,611
2530,"I was ready to sink fromfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politicto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed intoapprehension or conscious guilt.",611
2531,Little did I then expect the calamity thatwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despairall fear of ignominy or death.,611
2532,"I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory ofthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to myrecollection.",612
2533,Chapter 21,614
2534,"I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an oldbenevolent man with calm and mild manners.",615
2535,"He looked upon me, however,with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",615
2536,"About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by themagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before withhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put infor port.",616
2537,"It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they didnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek abouttwo miles below.",616
2538,"He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,and his companions followed him at some distance.",616
2539,"As he was proceedingalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at hislength on the ground.",616
2540,"His companions came up to assist him, and by thelight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,who was to all appearance dead.",616
2541,"Their first supposition was that it was thecorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by thewaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and eventhat the body was not then cold.",616
2542,"They instantly carried it to the cottageof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore itto life.",616
2543,"It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twentyyears of age.",616
2544,"He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign ofany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.",616
2545,"The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, butwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder ofmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and amist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair forsupport.",617
2546,The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drewan unfavourable augury from my manner.,617
2547,"The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent wascalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, hesaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the sameboat in which I had just landed.",618
2548,"A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the doorof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hourbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat withonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpsewas afterwards found.",619
2549,Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought thebody into her house; it was not cold.,620
2550,"They put it into a bed andrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life wasquite gone.",620
2551,"Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreedthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, itwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had beenobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",621
2552,"Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the bodyfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to knowthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distanceof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",621
2553,"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken intothe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed whateffect the sight of it would produce upon me.",622
2554,This idea was probablysuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of themurder had been described.,622
2555,"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrateand several other persons, to the inn.",622
2556,"I could not help being struck by thestrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I hadinhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectlytranquil as to the consequences of the affair.",622
2557,I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.,623
2558,Howcan I describe my sensations on beholding it?,623
2559,"I feel yet parched withhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering andagony.",623
2560,"The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of HenryClerval stretched before me.",623
2561,"I gasped for breath, and throwing myself onthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived youalso, my dearest Henry, of life?",623
2562,"Two I have already destroyed; othervictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, mybenefactor—”",623
2563,"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, andI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",624
2564,A fever succeeded to this.,625
2565,"I lay for two months on the point of death; myravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself themurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",625
2566,"Sometimes I entreated myattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I wastormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already graspingmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",625
2567,"Fortunately, as I spokemy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures andbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.",625
2568,Why did I not die?,626
2569,"More miserable than man ever was before, why did I notsink into forgetfulness and rest?",626
2570,"Death snatches away many bloomingchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides andyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and thenext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",626
2571,"Of what materials was Imade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning ofthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?",626
2572,"But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking froma dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded bygaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",627
2573,"It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I hadforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if somegreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked aroundand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which Iwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.",627
2574,This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair besideme.,628
2575,"She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and hercountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterisethat class.",628
2576,"The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that ofpersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.",628
2577,"Hertone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.",628
2578,"“Are you better now, sir?” said she.",629
2579,"I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I amstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”",630
2580,"“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about thegentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if youwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!",631
2581,"However, that’s noneof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my dutywith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”",631
2582,"I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling aspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I feltlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",632
2583,"The whole seriesof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed itwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the forceof reality.",632
2584,"As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grewfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothedme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",633
2585,"Thephysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman preparedthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and theexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of thesecond.",633
2586,Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but thehangman who would gain his fee?,633
2587,"These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin hadshown me extreme kindness.",634
2588,He had caused the best room in the prisonto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he whohad provided a physician and a nurse.,634
2589,"It is true, he seldom came tosee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings ofevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies andmiserable ravings of a murderer.",634
2590,"He came, therefore, sometimes to seethat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with longintervals.",634
2591,"One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyeshalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death.",635
2592,I was overcome by gloomand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire toremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.,635
2593,"At one time Iconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer thepenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been.",635
2594,Such were mythoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.,635
2595,"His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close tomine and addressed me in French,",635
2596,“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything tomake you more comfortable?”,636
2597,"“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the wholeearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”",637
2598,“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief toone borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.,638
2599,"But you will, Ihope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence caneasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”",638
2600,"“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, becomethe most miserable of mortals.",639
2601,"Persecuted and tortured as I am andhave been, can death be any evil to me?”",639
2602,“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than thestrange chances that have lately occurred.,640
2603,"You were thrown, by somesurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,seized immediately, and charged with murder.",640
2604,"The first sight that waspresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in sounaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend acrossyour path.”",640
2605,"As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured onthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise atthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",641
2606,"I suppose someastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastenedto say,",641
2607,"“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were onyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover sometrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortuneand illness.",642
2608,"I found several letters, and, among others, one which Idiscovered from its commencement to be from your father.",642
2609,I instantly wroteto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.,642
2610,But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of anykind.”,642
2611,"“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I amnow to lament?”",643
2612,"“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin withgentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”",644
2613,"I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but itinstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at mymisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement forme to comply with his hellish desires.",645
2614,"I put my hand before my eyes,and cried out in agony,",645
2615,“Oh!,646
2616,Take him away!,646
2617,"I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do notlet him enter!”",646
2618,Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.,647
2619,"He could not helpregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said inrather a severe tone,",647
2620,"“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your fatherwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”",648
2621,"“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxedfrom anguish to pleasure.",649
2622,“Is my father indeed come?,649
2623,"How kind, howvery kind!",649
2624,"But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”",649
2625,"My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps hethought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",650
2626,"He rose andquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",650
2627,"Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than thearrival of my father.",651
2628,"I stretched out my hand to him and cried,",651
2629,“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”,652
2630,"My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, bydwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise mydesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode ofcheerfulness.",653
2631,"“What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearanceof the room.",653
2632,"“You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seemsto pursue you.",653
2633,And poor Clerval—”,653
2634,The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation toogreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.,654
2635,“Alas!,655
2636,"Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of themost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely Ishould have died on the coffin of Henry.”",655
2637,"We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for theprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary thatcould ensure tranquillity.",656
2638,Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that mystrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.,656
2639,"But theappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and Igradually recovered my health.",656
2640,"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and blackmelancholy that nothing could dissipate.",657
2641,"The image of Clerval wasfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered.",657
2642,More than once the agitationinto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerousrelapse.,657
2643,Alas!,657
2644,Why did they preserve so miserable and detested alife?,657
2645,"It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is nowdrawing to a close.",657
2646,"Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish thesethrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bearsme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall alsosink to rest.",657
2647,"Then the appearance of death was distant, although thewish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hoursmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution thatmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.",657
2648,The season of the assizes approached.,658
2649,"I had already been three monthsin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of arelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the countrytown where the court was held.",658
2650,Mr. Kirwin charged himself with everycare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.,658
2651,"I was sparedthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was notbrought before the court that decides on life and death.",658
2652,"The grandjury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the OrkneyIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnightafter my removal I was liberated from prison.",658
2653,"My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of acriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the freshatmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.",659
2654,"I did notparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or apalace were alike hateful.",659
2655,"The cup of life was poisoned for ever, andalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, Isaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated byno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",659
2656,"Sometimesthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the darkorbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringedthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as Ifirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",659
2657,My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.,660
2658,"He talkedof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; butthese words only drew deep groans from me.",660
2659,"Sometimes, indeed, I felt awish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my belovedcousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once morethe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in earlychildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which aprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; andthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish anddespair.",660
2660,"At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to theexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilanceto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",660
2661,"Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finallytriumphed over my selfish despair.",661
2662,"It was necessary that I shouldreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of thoseI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if anychance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again toblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end tothe existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with themockery of a soul still more monstrous.",661
2663,"My father still desired todelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of ajourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.",661
2664,Mystrength was gone.,661
2665,"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and daypreyed upon my wasted frame.",661
2666,"Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,my father thought it best to yield.",662
2667,We took our passage on board a vesselbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.,662
2668,It was midnight.,662
2669,I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening tothe dashing of the waves.,662
2670,"I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from mysight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I shouldsoon see Geneva.",662
2671,"The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detestedshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forciblythat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearestcompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",662
2672,"Irepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residingwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure forIngolstadt.",662
2673,"I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me onto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night inwhich he first lived.",662
2674,"I was unable to pursue the train of thought; athousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",662
2675,"Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of takingevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drugonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation oflife.",663
2676,"Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I nowswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly.",663
2677,But sleep didnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented athousand objects that scared me.,663
2678,Towards morning I was possessed by a kindof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not freemyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears.,663
2679,"My father, who waswatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waveswere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense ofsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hourand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calmforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarlysusceptible.",663
2680,Chapter 22,665
2681,The voyage came to an end.,666
2682,"We landed, and proceeded to Paris.",666
2683,I soonfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before Icould continue my journey.,666
2684,"My father’s care and attentions wereindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings andsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.",666
2685,He wished me toseek amusement in society.,666
2686,I abhorred the face of man.,666
2687,"Oh, notabhorred!",666
2688,"They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I feltattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of anangelic nature and celestial mechanism.",666
2689,But I felt that I had no rightto share their intercourse.,666
2690,I had unchained an enemy among them whosejoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.,666
2691,"How theywould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they knowmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!",666
2692,My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove byvarious arguments to banish my despair.,667
2693,"Sometimes he thought that Ifelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge ofmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",667
2694,“Alas!,668
2695,"My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.",668
2696,"Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if sucha wretch as I felt pride.",668
2697,"Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocentas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the causeof this—I murdered her.",668
2698,"William, Justine, and Henry—they alldied by my hands.”",668
2699,"My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the sameassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire anexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring ofdelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presenteditself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in myconvalescence.",669
2700,I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silenceconcerning the wretch I had created.,669
2701,"I had a persuasion that I should besupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue.",669
2702,"But,besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill myhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates ofhis breast.",669
2703,"I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and wassilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.",669
2704,"Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollablyfrom me.",669
2705,"I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in partrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.",669
2706,"Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?",670
2707,"My dear son, I entreatyou never to make such an assertion again.”",670
2708,"“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, whohave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",671
2709,I am theassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.,671
2710,"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to havesaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could notsacrifice the whole human race.”",671
2711,"The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas werederanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation andendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",672
2712,He wished as much aspossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place inIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of mymisfortunes.,672
2713,"As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in myheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my owncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",673
2714,"By the utmostself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, whichsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my mannerswere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journeyto the sea of ice.",673
2715,"A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received thefollowing letter from Elizabeth:",674
2716,"“My dear Friend,",675
2717,"“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncledated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I mayhope to see you in less than a fortnight.",676
2718,"My poor cousin, how much youmust have suffered!",676
2719,I expect to see you looking even more ill thanwhen you quitted Geneva.,676
2720,"This winter has been passed most miserably,tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace inyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void ofcomfort and tranquillity.",676
2721,"“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserablea year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",677
2722,"I would not disturb you atthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but aconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renderssome explanation necessary before we meet.",677
2723,Explanation!,678
2724,"You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?",678
2725,"Ifyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.",678
2726,"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yetbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being thecase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, Ihave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.",678
2727,"“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan ofyour parents ever since our infancy.",679
2728,"We were told this when young, andtaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly takeplace.",679
2729,"We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, Ibelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",679
2730,"Butas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards eachother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be ourcase?",679
2731,"Tell me, dearest Victor.",679
2732,"Answer me, I conjure you by our mutualhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?",679
2733,"“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life atIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you lastautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of everycreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret ourconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes ofyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",680
2734,But this is false reasoning.,680
2735,"I confess to you, my friend, that I loveyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constantfriend and companion.",680
2736,But it is your happiness I desire as well as myown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternallymiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.,680
2737,"Even nowI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellestmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of thatlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.",680
2738,"I, whohave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseriestenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.",680
2739,Ah!,680
2740,"Victor, be assuredthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to bemade miserable by this supposition.",680
2741,"Be happy, my friend; and if youobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earthwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.",680
2742,"“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or thenext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",681
2743,"My unclewill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on yourlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, Ishall need no other happiness.",681
2744,“Elizabeth Lavenza.,682
2745,"“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”",684
2746,"This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat ofthe fiend—“_I will be with you on yourwedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would thedæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse ofhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings.",686
2747,On that night hehad determined to consummate his crimes by my death.,686
2748,"Well, be it so; adeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he werevictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end.",686
2749,"If hewere vanquished, I should be a free man.",686
2750,Alas!,686
2751,What freedom?,686
2752,"Such as thepeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, hiscottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,penniless, and alone, but free.",686
2753,"Such would be my liberty except that in myElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors ofremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.",686
2754,Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!,687
2755,"I read and reread her letter, and somesoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacaldreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and theangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",687
2756,Yet I would die to makeher happy.,687
2757,"If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",687
2758,"Mydestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturershould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he wouldsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",687
2759,"He had vowed_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider thatthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me thathe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediatelyafter the enunciation of his threats.",687
2760,"I resolved, therefore, that if myimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or myfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my lifeshould not retard it a single hour.",687
2761,In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.,688
2762,My letter was calm andaffectionate.,688
2763,"“I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happinessremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred inyou.",688
2764,Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my lifeand my endeavours for contentment.,688
2765,"I have one secret, Elizabeth, adreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame withhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will onlywonder that I survive what I have endured.",688
2766,"I will confide this tale ofmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",688
2767,"Butuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",688
2768,"This I mostearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”",688
2769,In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returnedto Geneva.,689
2770,"The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears werein her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",689
2771,I saw achange in her also.,689
2772,She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenlyvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks ofcompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as Iwas.,689
2773,The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.,690
2774,"Memory brought madnesswith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessedme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low anddespondent.",690
2775,"I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",690
2776,Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voicewould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with humanfeelings when sunk in torpor.,691
2777,She wept with me and for me.,691
2778,"When reasonreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me withresignation.",691
2779,Ah!,691
2780,"It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for theguilty there is no peace.",691
2781,The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there isotherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.,691
2782,Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage withElizabeth.,692
2783,I remained silent.,692
2784,"“Have you, then, some other attachment?”",693
2785,“None on earth.,694
2786,I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union withdelight.,694
2787,"Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecratemyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”",694
2788,"“My dear Victor, do not speak thus.",695
2789,"Heavy misfortunes have befallenus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our lovefor those whom we have lost to those who yet live.",695
2790,Our circle will besmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.,695
2791,"And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects ofcare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruellydeprived.”",695
2792,Such were the lessons of my father.,696
2793,"But to me the remembrance of thethreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend hadyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him asinvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be withyou on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate asunavoidable.",696
2794,"But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth werebalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerfulcountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, theceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,the seal to my fate.",696
2795,Great God!,697
2796,"If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellishintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myselffor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast overthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.",697
2797,"But, as ifpossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his realintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, Ihastened that of a far dearer victim.",697
2798,"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice ora prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",698
2799,"But I concealed myfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to thecountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicereye of Elizabeth.",698
2800,"She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipateinto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.",698
2801,"Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,and all wore a smiling appearance.",699
2802,"I shut up, as well as I could, in my ownheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestnessinto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as thedecorations of my tragedy.",699
2803,Through my father’s exertions a part ofthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austriangovernment.,699
2804,A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her.,699
2805,"Itwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to VillaLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lakenear which it stood.",699
2806,In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case thefiend should openly attack me.,700
2807,"I carried pistols and a daggerconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, andby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",700
2808,"Indeed, as theperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to beregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped forin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixedfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken ofas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",700
2809,Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly tocalm her mind.,701
2810,"But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and mydestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I hadpromised to reveal to her on the following day.",701
2811,"My father was in themeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised inthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",701
2812,"After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at myfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence ourjourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing ourvoyage on the following day.",702
2813,"The day was fair, the wind favourable;all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.",702
2814,Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed thefeeling of happiness.,703
2815,"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but wewere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed thebeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we sawMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowymountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting theopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to theambition that would quit its native country, and an almostinsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",703
2816,I took the hand of Elizabeth.,704
2817,"“You are sorrowful, my love.",704
2818,Ah!,704
2819,"Ifyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you wouldendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that thisone day at least permits me to enjoy.”",704
2820,"“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is notpainted in my face, my heart is contented.",705
2821,"Something whispers to menot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but Iwill not listen to such a sinister voice.",705
2822,"Observe how fast we movealong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes riseabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still moreinteresting.",705
2823,"Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming inthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies atthe bottom.",705
2824,What a divine day!,705
2825,How happy and serene all natureappears!”,705
2826,Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from allreflection upon melancholy subjects.,706
2827,"But her temper was fluctuating;joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave placeto distraction and reverie.",706
2828,The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance andobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of thelower hills.,707
2829,"The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approachedthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",707
2830,Thespire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the rangeof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.,707
2831,"The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the waterand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached theshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers andhay.",708
2832,"The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touchedthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to claspme and cling to me for ever.",708
2833,Chapter 23,710
2834,"It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on theshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn andcontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscuredin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",711
2835,"The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violencein the west.",712
2836,"The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and wasbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than theflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected thescene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless wavesthat were beginning to rise.",712
2837,Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.,712
2838,"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured theshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",713
2839,"I was anxiousand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden inmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell mylife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or thatof my adversary was extinguished.",713
2840,"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, andtrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?",714
2841,What is it you fear?”,714
2842,“Oh!,715
2843,"Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, andall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”",715
2844,"I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected howfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join heruntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",716
2845,"She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passagesof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat tomy adversary.",717
2846,But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning toconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent theexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadfulscream.,717
2847,It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.,717
2848,"As Iheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, themotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the bloodtrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",717
2849,"Thisstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushedinto the room.",717
2850,Great God!,718
2851,Why did I not then expire!,718
2852,Why am I here to relate thedestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth?,718
2853,"She wasthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging downand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",718
2854,Everywhere Iturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flungby the murderer on its bridal bier.,718
2855,Could I behold this and live?,718
2856,Alas!,718
2857,Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.,718
2858,For a momentonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.,718
2859,"When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; theircountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of othersappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me.",719
2860,"Iescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, mywife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",719
2861,"She had been moved from theposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head uponher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might havesupposed her asleep.",719
2862,"I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, butthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now heldin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",719
2863,"The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and thebreath had ceased to issue from her lips.",719
2864,"While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.",720
2865,"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind ofpanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.",720
2866,"The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to bedescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.",720
2867,"A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with hisfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife.",720
2868,"I rushed towardsthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,plunged into the lake.",720
2869,The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.,721
2870,"I pointed tothe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track withboats; nets were cast, but in vain.",721
2871,"After passing several hours, wereturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been aform conjured up by my fancy.",721
2872,"After having landed, they proceeded tosearch the country, parties going in different directions among thewoods and vines.",721
2873,"I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from thehouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunkenman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered myeyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.",722
2874,"In this state Iwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what hadhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something thatI had lost.",722
2875,"After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the roomwhere the corpse of my beloved lay.",723
2876,"There were women weeping around; Ihung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time nodistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled tovarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and theircause.",723
2877,"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.",723
2878,"The deathof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastlyof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remainingfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even nowmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at hisfeet.",723
2879,This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.,723
2880,I startedup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.,723
2881,"There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but thewind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",724
2882,"However, it washardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",724
2883,"I hired mento row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief frommental torment in bodily exercise.",724
2884,"But the overflowing misery I now felt,and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of anyexertion.",724
2885,"I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave wayto every gloomy idea that arose.",724
2886,"If I looked up, I saw scenes which werefamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the daybefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.",724
2887,Tears streamed from my eyes.,724
2888,"The rain had ceased for a moment, and I sawthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they hadthen been observed by Elizabeth.",724
2889,Nothing is so painful to the human mind asa great and sudden change.,724
2890,"The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before.",724
2891,A fiend hadsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever beenso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history ofman.,724
2892,But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this lastoverwhelming event?,725
2893,"Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",725
2894,"Knowthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",725
2895,"Myown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains ofmy hideous narration.",725
2896,I arrived at Geneva.,726
2897,"My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunkunder the tidings that I bore.",726
2898,"I see him now, excellent and venerable oldman!",726
2899,"His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and theirdelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on withall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, havingfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",726
2900,"Cursed, cursedbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to wastein wretchedness!",726
2901,"He could not live under the horrors that were accumulatedaround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable torise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.",726
2902,What then became of me?,727
2903,"I know not; I lost sensation, and chains anddarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",727
2904,"Sometimes,indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant valeswith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in adungeon.",727
2905,"Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clearconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from myprison.",727
2906,"For they had called me mad, and during many months, as Iunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.",727
2907,"Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as Iawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",728
2908,"As thememory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on theircause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I hadsent abroad into the world for my destruction.",728
2909,"I was possessed by amaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayedthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signalrevenge on his cursed head.",728
2910,"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began toreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, abouta month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the townand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew thedestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his wholeauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.",729
2911,The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness.,730
2912,"“Beassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shallbe spared to discover the villain.”",730
2913,"“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to thedeposition that I have to make.",731
2914,"It is indeed a tale so strange that Ishould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truthwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction.",731
2915,"The story is too connected tobe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” Mymanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in myown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purposequieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life.",731
2916,"I now relatedmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates withaccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",731
2917,"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continuedhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder withhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was paintedon his countenance.",732
2918,"When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom Iaccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert yourwhole power.",733
2919,"It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope thatyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of thosefunctions on this occasion.”",733
2920,This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my ownauditor.,734
2921,"He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is givento a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called uponto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulityreturned.",734
2922,"He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford youevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears tohave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance.",734
2923,Who can follow ananimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens whereno man would venture to intrude?,734
2924,"Besides, some months have elapsed sincethe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place hehas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”",734
2925,"“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and ifhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamoisand destroyed as a beast of prey.",735
2926,But I perceive your thoughts; you do notcredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with thepunishment which is his desert.”,735
2927,"As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.",736
2928,"“You are mistaken,” said he.",736
2929,"“I will exert myself, and ifit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall sufferpunishment proportionate to his crimes.",736
2930,"But I fear, from what you haveyourself described to be his properties, that this will proveimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you shouldmake up your mind to disappointment.”",736
2931,“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.,737
2932,"Myrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, Iconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",737
2933,"My rageis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turnedloose upon society, still exists.",737
2934,"You refuse my just demand; I havebut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, tohis destruction.”",737
2935,"I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzyin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fiercenesswhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",738
2936,"But to a Genevanmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those ofdevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance ofmadness.",738
2937,He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child andreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.,738
2938,"“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride ofwisdom!",739
2939,Cease; you know not what it is you say.”,739
2940,I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate onsome other mode of action.,740
2941,Chapter 24,742
2942,My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought wasswallowed up and lost.,743
2943,I was hurried away by fury; revenge aloneendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings andallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwisedelirium or death would have been my portion.,743
2944,"My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when Iwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, becamehateful.",744
2945,"I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewelswhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.",744
2946,And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.,745
2947,I havetraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardshipswhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.,745
2948,How Ihave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs uponthe sandy plain and prayed for death.,745
2949,But revenge kept me alive; I darednot die and leave my adversary in being.,745
2950,When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which Imight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.,746
2951,"But my plan was unsettled,and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertainwhat path I should pursue.",746
2952,"As night approached I found myself at theentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my fatherreposed.",746
2953,I entered it and approached the tomb which marked theirgraves.,746
2954,"Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, whichwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and thescene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterestedobserver.",746
2955,"The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and tocast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of themourner.",746
2956,The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way torage and despair.,747
2957,"They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",747
2958,"I knelt on the grassand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By thesacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by thedeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and thespirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",747
2959,"For this purpose I willpreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sunand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from myeyes for ever.",747
2960,"And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wanderingministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work.",747
2961,Let the cursedand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that nowtorments me.”,747
2962,"I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured methat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, butthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.",748
2963,I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendishlaugh.,749
2964,"It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoedit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",749
2965,Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and havedestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that Iwas reserved for vengeance.,749
2966,"The laughter died away, when a well-knownand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in anaudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch!",749
2967,"You havedetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”",749
2968,"I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devileluded my grasp.",750
2969,Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shonefull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more thanmortal speed.,750
2970,"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.",751
2971,"Guided by aslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",751
2972,"Theblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiendenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",751
2973,"Itook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.",751
2974,"Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, Ihave ever followed in his track.",752
2975,"Sometimes the peasants, scared bythis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,left some mark to guide me.",752
2976,"The snows descended on my head, and I sawthe print of his huge step on the white plain.",752
2977,"To you first enteringon life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understandwhat I have felt and still feel?",752
2978,"Cold, want, and fatigue were theleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some deviland carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of goodfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenlyextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",752
2979,"Sometimes,when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repastwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.",752
2980,"Thefare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, butI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I hadinvoked to aid me.",752
2981,"Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, andI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed thefew drops that revived me, and vanish.",752
2982,"I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmongenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of thecountry chiefly collected.",753
2983,"In other places human beings were seldomseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed mypath.",753
2984,"I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagersby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who hadprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.",753
2985,"My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was duringsleep alone that I could taste joy.",754
2986,O blessed sleep!,754
2987,"Often, when mostmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",754
2988,"Thespirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, ofhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",754
2989,"Deprived ofthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",754
2990,"During the day I wassustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw myfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolentcountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’svoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",754
2991,"Often, when wearied bya toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night shouldcome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearestfriends.",754
2992,What agonising fondness did I feel for them!,754
2993,"How did I cling totheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, andpersuade myself that they still lived!",754
2994,"At such moments vengeance, thatburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards thedestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as themechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as theardent desire of my soul.",754
2995,What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know.,755
2996,"Sometimes, indeed, heleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guidedme and instigated my fury.",755
2997,"“My reign is not yetover”—these words were legible in one of theseinscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete.",755
2998,"Follow me; Iseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery ofcold and frost, to which I am impassive.",755
2999,"You will find near this place, ifyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed.",755
3000,"Come on, myenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserablehours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”",755
3001,Scoffing devil!,756
3002,"Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,miserable fiend, to torture and death.",756
3003,"Never will I give up my searchuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join myElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me thereward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!",756
3004,"As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and thecold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",757
3005,"The peasants wereshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth toseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places toseek for prey.",757
3006,"The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could beprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.",757
3007,The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.,758
3008,Oneinscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare!,758
3009,"Your toilsonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enterupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlastinghatred.”",758
3010,"My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; Iresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to supportme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundaryof the horizon.",759
3011,Oh!,759
3012,How unlike it was to the blue seasons of thesouth!,759

3015,"I did not weep, but I knelt downand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me insafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,to meet and grapple with him.",759
3016,Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thustraversed the snows with inconceivable speed.,760
3017,"I know not whether thefiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I haddaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so thatwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, andI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",760
3018,"With newcourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretchedhamlet on the seashore.",760
3019,I inquired of the inhabitants concerning thefiend and gained accurate information.,760
3020,"A gigantic monster, they said,had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear ofhis terrific appearance.",760
3021,"He had carried off their store of winterfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on anumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the samenight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued hisjourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and theyconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of theice or frozen by the eternal frosts.",760
3022,On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.,761
3023,"He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endlessjourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that fewof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of agenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",761
3024,"Yet at the ideathat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeancereturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",761

3028,"Immense andrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heardthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",763
3029,Butagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.,763
3030,"By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess thatI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protractionof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops ofdespondency and grief from my eyes.",764
3031,"Despair had indeed almost securedher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.",764
3032,"Once, afterthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained thesummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eyecaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",764
3033,I strained my sight todiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when Idistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-knownform within.,764
3034,Oh!,764
3035,With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!,764
3036,"Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they mightnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight wasdimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions thatoppressed me, I wept aloud.",764
3037,"But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of theirdead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after anhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterlyirksome to me, I continued my route.",765
3038,"The sledge was still visible, nordid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a shorttime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",765
3039,"I indeedperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, Ibeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded withinme.",765
3040,"But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes weresuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I hadever done before.",766
3041,"A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, asthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominousand terrific.",766
3042,"I pressed on, but in vain.",766
3043,"The wind arose; the sea roared;and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with atremendous and overwhelming sound.",766
3044,"The work was soon finished; in a fewminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was leftdrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening andthus preparing for me a hideous death.",766
3045,"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and Imyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw yourvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.",767
3046,I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astoundedat the sight.,767
3047,"I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, andby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft inthe direction of your ship.",767
3048,"I had determined, if you were going southwards,still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon mypurpose.",767
3049,I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursuemy enemy.,767
3050,But your direction was northwards.,767
3051,"You took me on board when myvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multipliedhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.",767
3052,Oh!,768

3056,No; I am not so selfish.,768

3066,"His fine and lovely eyeswere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrowand quenched in infinite wretchedness.",771
3067,"Sometimes he commanded hiscountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with atranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like avolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expressionof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.",771
3068,"His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me agreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,however earnest and connected.",772

3243,"Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, ofsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness.",810
3244,I shut my eyes involuntarily andendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.,810
3245,I called on him to stay.,810
3246,"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards thelifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, andevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of someuncontrollable passion.",811
3247,“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed.,812
3248,“In his murder mycrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to itsclose!,812
3249,"Oh, Frankenstein!",812
3250,Generous and self-devoted being!,812
3251,What does itavail that I now ask thee to pardon me?,812
3252,"I, who irretrievably destroyed theeby destroying all thou lovedst.",812
3253,Alas!,812
3254,"He is cold, he cannot answerme.”",812
3255,"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested tome the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying hisenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion.",813
3256,"Iapproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to hisface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness.",813
3257,"Iattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips.",813
3258,The monstercontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches.,813
3259,At length Igathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.,813
3260,"“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous.",814
3261,"If youhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorsebefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,Frankenstein would yet have lived.”",814
3262,“And do you dream?” said the dæmon.,815
3263,“Do you think that I was thendead to agony and remorse?,815
3264,"He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed.",815
3265,Oh!,815
3266,Not theten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during thelingering detail of its execution.,815
3267,"A frightful selfishness hurried meon, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.",815
3268,Think you that thegroans of Clerval were music to my ears?,815
3269,"My heart was fashioned to besusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to viceand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change withouttorture such as you cannot even imagine.",815
3270,"“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-brokenand overcome.",816
3271,I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; Iabhorred myself.,816
3272,"But when I discovered that he, the author at once ofmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope forhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon mehe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from theindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitterindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.",816
3273,Irecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.,816
3274,"Iknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was theslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could notdisobey.",816
3275,Yet when she died!,816
3276,"Nay, then I was not miserable.",816
3277,"I hadcast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of mydespair.",816
3278,Evil thenceforth became my good.,816
3279,"Urged thus far, I had nochoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willinglychosen.",816
3280,The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiablepassion.,816
3281,And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”,816
3282,"I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I calledto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence andpersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of myfriend, indignation was rekindled within me.",817
3283,“Wretch!” I said.,817
3284,“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that youhave made.,817
3285,"You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they areconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall.",817
3286,Hypocritical fiend!,817
3287,"If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again wouldhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance.",817
3288,It is not pity that youfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawnfrom your power.”,817
3289,"“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.",818
3290,“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears tobe the purport of my actions.,818
3291,Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.,818
3292,No sympathy may I ever find.,818
3293,"When I first sought it, it was the love ofvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole beingoverflowed, that I wished to be participated.",818
3294,"But now that virtue hasbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned intobitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",818
3295,"I amcontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I amwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",818
3296,"Oncemy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment.",818
3297,"OnceI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, wouldlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.",818
3298,I wasnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion.,818
3299,But now crime hasdegraded me beneath the meanest animal.,818
3300,"No guilt, no mischief, nomalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine.",818
3301,"When I run over thefrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the samecreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendentvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",818
3302,But it is even so; thefallen angel becomes a malignant devil.,818
3303,Yet even that enemy of God and manhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.,818
3304,"“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of mycrimes and his misfortunes.",819
3305,But in the detail which he gave you of themhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I enduredwasting in impotent passions.,819
3306,"For while I destroyed his hopes, I didnot satisfy my own desires.",819
3307,"They were for ever ardent and craving; stillI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",819
3308,Was there noinjustice in this?,819
3309,"Am I to be thought the only criminal, when allhumankind sinned against me?",819
3310,"Why do you not hate Felix, who drove hisfriend from his door with contumely?",819
3311,Why do you not execrate the rusticwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child?,819
3312,"Nay, these are virtuousand immaculate beings!",819
3313,"I, the miserable and the abandoned, am anabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",819
3314,Even now myblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.,819
3315,“But it is true that I am a wretch.,820
3316,I have murdered the lovely andthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped todeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.,820
3317,"I havedevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love andadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to thatirremediable ruin.",820
3318,"There he lies, white and cold in death.",820
3319,"You hate me, butyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",820
3320,"I look on thehands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which theimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these handswill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.",820
3321,“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief.,821
3322,My workis nearly complete.,821
3323,"Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed toconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,but it requires my own.",821
3324,Do not think that I shall be slow to perform thissacrifice.,821
3325,"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought methither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shallcollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that itsremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who wouldcreate such another as I have been.",821
3326,I shall die.,821
3327,"I shall no longer feel theagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yetunquenched.",821

3329,I shall nolonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.,821
3330,"Light,feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find myhappiness.",821
3331,"Some years ago, when the images which this world affords firstopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard therustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all tome, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation.",821
3332,"Polluted bycrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but indeath?",821
3333,“Farewell!,822

3335,"Farewell, Frankenstein!",822
3336,"If thou wert yet aliveand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be bettersatiated in my life than in my destruction.",822
3337,"But it was not so; thoudidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to thinkand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater thanthat which I feel.",822
3338,"Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior tothine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in mywounds until death shall close them for ever.",822
3339,"“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “Ishall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt.",823
3340,Soon these burningmiseries will be extinct.,823
3341,I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly andexult in the agony of the torturing flames.,823
