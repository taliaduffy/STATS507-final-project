50,"The stars were shining, and theleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, awayoff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and adog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind wastrying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out what it was,and so it made the cold shivers run over me.",8
51,"Then away out in the woodsI heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tellabout something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself understood,and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way everynight grieving.",8

61,I set still and listened.,9
62,Directly Icould just barely hear a “_me-yow!,9
63,me-yow!_” down there.,9
64,That was good!,9
65,"Says I, “_me-yow!",9
66,"me-yow!_” as soft as I could, and then I put out thelight and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.",9

68,CHAPTER II.,11
69,"We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the endof the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t scrapeour heads.",12
70,When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root andmade a noise.,12
71,We scrouched down and laid still.,12
72,"Miss Watson’s bignigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see himpretty clear, because there was a light behind him.",12
73,"He got up andstretched his neck out about a minute, listening.",12
74,Then he says:,12
75,“Who dah?”,13
76,"He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood rightbetween us; we could a touched him, nearly.",14
77,"Well, likely it was minutesand minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so closetogether.",14
78,"There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but Idasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,right between my shoulders.",14
79,Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t scratch.,14
80,"Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.",14
81,"If you are with thequality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain’tsleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t do for you to scratch, whyyou will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places.",14
82,Pretty soon Jimsays:,14
83,"“Say, who is you?",15
84,Whar is you?,15
85,Dog my cats ef I didn’ hear sumf’n.,15
86,"Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s gwyne to set down here andlisten tell I hears it agin.”",15

90,It itched till the tearscome into my eyes.,16
91,But I dasn’t scratch.,16
92,Then it begun to itch on theinside.,16
93,Next I got to itching underneath.,16
94,I didn’t know how I was goingto set still.,16
95,This miserableness went on as much as six or sevenminutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.,16
96,I was itching ineleven different places now.,16
97,"I reckoned I couldn’t stand it more’n aminute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.",16
98,Just thenJim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore—and then I waspretty soon comfortable again.,16
99,Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and wewent creeping away on our hands and knees.,17
100,"When we was ten foot off Tomwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.",17
101,"But I saidno; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d find out Iwarn’t in.",17
102,"Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles enough, and he wouldslip in the kitchen and get some more.",17
103,I didn’t want him to try.,17
104,I saidJim might wake up and come.,17
105,"But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid inthere and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table forpay.",17
106,"Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothingwould do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands andknees, and play something on him.",17
107,"I waited, and it seemed a good while,everything was so still and lonesome.",17
108,"As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,and by-and-by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side ofthe house.",18
109,"Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and hung it ona limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t wake.",18
110,"Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance,and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the treesagain, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.",18
111,"And next timeJim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by hesaid they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, andhis back was all over saddle-boils.",18
112,"Jim was monstrous proud about it,and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers.",18
113,"Niggerswould come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked upto than any nigger in that country.",18
114,"Strange niggers would stand withtheir mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.",18
115,"Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchenfire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all aboutsuch things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm!",18
116,What you know ’boutwitches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.,18
117,"Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string,and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, andtold him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever hewanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it washe said to it.",18
118,"Niggers would come from all around there and give Jimanything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but theywouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it.",18
119,"Jim wasmost ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of havingseen the devil and been rode by witches.",18
120,"Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked awaydown into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparklingever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole milebroad, and awful still and grand.",19
121,"We went down the hill and found JoHarper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in theold tanyard.",19
122,"So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mileand a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.",19
123,"We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep thesecret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickestpart of the bushes.",20
124,"Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on ourhands and knees.",20
125,"We went about two hundred yards, and then the caveopened up.",20
126,"Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon duckedunder a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.",20
127,"Wewent along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp andsweaty and cold, and there we stopped.",20
128,Tom says:,20
129,"“Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s Gang.",21
130,"Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write hisname in blood.”",21
131,Everybody was willing.,22
132,"So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he hadwrote the oath on, and read it.",22
133,"It swore every boy to stick to theband, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anythingto any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that personand his family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep tillhe had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was thesign of the band.",22
134,"And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could usethat mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again hemust be killed.",22
135,"And if anybody that belonged to the band told thesecrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burntup and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of thelist with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curseput on it and be forgot forever.",22
136,"Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got itout of his own head.",23
137,"He said, some of it, but the rest was out ofpirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned hadit.",23
138,Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that toldthe secrets.,24
139,"Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wroteit in.",24
140,Then Ben Rogers says:,24
141,"“Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you going to do ’bouthim?”",25
142,"“Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.",26
143,"“Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him these days.",27
144,"Heused to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain’t been seenin these parts for a year or more.”",27
145,"They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because theysaid every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else itwouldn’t be fair and square for the others.",28
146,"Well, nobody could think ofanything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still.",28
147,"I was most readyto cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them MissWatson—they could kill her.",28
148,Everybody said:,28
149,"“Oh, she’ll do.",29
150,That’s all right.,29
151,Huck can come in.”,29
152,"Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,and I made my mark on the paper.",30
153,"“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of business of this Gang?”",31
154,"“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.",32
155,"“But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”",33
156,“Stuff!,34
157,"stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s burglary,”says Tom Sawyer.",34
158,“We ain’t burglars.,34
159,That ain’t no sort of style.,34
160,Weare highwaymen.,34
161,"We stop stages and carriages on the road, with maskson, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”",34
162,“Must we always kill the people?”,35
163,"“Oh, certainly.",36
164,It’s best.,36
165,"Some authorities think different, but mostlyit’s considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to thecave here, and keep them till they’re ransomed.”",36
166,“Ransomed?,37
167,What’s that?”,37
168,“I don’t know.,38
169,But that’s what they do.,38
170,I’ve seen it in books; and soof course that’s what we’ve got to do.”,38
171,“But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”,39
172,"“Why, blame it all, we’ve _got_ to do it.",40
173,Don’t I tell you it’s in thebooks?,40
174,"Do you want to go to doing different from what’s in the books,and get things all muddled up?”",40
175,"“Oh, that’s all very fine to _say_, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nationare these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t know how to do it tothem?—that’s the thing _I_ want to get at.",41
176,"Now, what do you _reckon_ itis?”",41
177,"“Well, I don’t know.",42
178,"But per’aps if we keep them till they’re ransomed,it means that we keep them till they’re dead.”",42
179,"“Now, that’s something _like_.",43
180,That’ll answer.,43
181,Why couldn’t you saidthat before?,43
182,"We’ll keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and abothersome lot they’ll be, too—eating up everything, and always tryingto get loose.”",43
183,"“How you talk, Ben Rogers.",44
184,"How can they get loose when there’s a guardover them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”",44
185,“A guard!,45
186,"Well, that _is_ good.",45
187,"So somebody’s got to set up all nightand never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.",45
188,I think that’sfoolishness.,45
189,Why can’t a body take a club and ransom them as soon asthey get here?”,45
190,“Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why.,46
191,"Now, Ben Rogers, do youwant to do things regular, or don’t you?—that’s the idea.",46
192,Don’t youreckon that the people that made the books knows what’s the correctthing to do?,46
193,Do you reckon _you_ can learn ’em anything?,46
194,Not by a gooddeal.,46
195,"No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”",46
196,“All right.,47
197,"I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool way, anyhow.",47
198,"Say, do wekill the women, too?”",47
199,"“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let on.",48
200,Killthe women?,48
201,No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.,48
202,"Youfetch them to the cave, and you’re always as polite as pie to them; andby-and-by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home anymore.”",48
203,"“Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t take no stock in it.",49
204,"Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellowswaiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be no place for the robbers.",49
205,"But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”",49
206,"Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he wasscared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’twant to be a robber any more.",50
207,"So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made himmad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.",51
208,"But Tomgive him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home andmeet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.",51
209,"Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so hewanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wickedto do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing.",52
210,"They agreed to gettogether and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected TomSawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and sostarted home.",52
211,I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day wasbreaking.,53
212,"My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I wasdog-tired.",53
213,CHAPTER III.,55
214,"Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson onaccount of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only cleanedoff the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I wouldbehave a while if I could.",56
215,"Then Miss Watson she took me in the closetand prayed, but nothing come of it.",56
216,"She told me to pray every day, andwhatever I asked for I would get it.",56
217,But it warn’t so.,56
218,I tried it.,56
219,"OnceI got a fish-line, but no hooks.",56
220,It warn’t any good to me withouthooks.,56
221,"I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow Icouldn’t make it work.",56
222,"By-and-by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to tryfor me, but she said I was a fool.",56
223,"She never told me why, and Icouldn’t make it out no way.",56
224,"I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.",57
225,"Isays to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’tDeacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork?",57
226,Why can’t the widow getback her silver snuffbox that was stole?,57
227,Why can’t Miss Watson fat up?,57
228,"No, says I to myself, there ain’t nothing in it.",57
229,"I went and told thewidow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying forit was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told mewhat she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could forother people, and look out for them all the time, and never think aboutmyself.",57
230,"This was including Miss Watson, as I took it.",57
231,"I went out in thewoods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see noadvantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned Iwouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.",57
232,Sometimes thewidow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to makea body’s mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take holdand knock it all down again.,57
233,"I judged I could see that there was twoProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with thewidow’s Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no helpfor him any more.",57
234,"I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong tothe widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how he wasa-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I wasso ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.",57
235,"Pap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortablefor me; I didn’t want to see him no more.",58
236,He used to always whale mewhen he was sober and could get his hands on me; though I used to taketo the woods most of the time when he was around.,58
237,"Well, about this timehe was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, sopeople said.",58
238,"They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man wasjust his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which wasall like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of the face, becauseit had been in the water so long it warn’t much like a face at all.",58
239,They said he was floating on his back in the water.,58
240,They took him andburied him on the bank.,58
241,"But I warn’t comfortable long, because Ihappened to think of something.",58
242,"I knowed mighty well that a drowndedman don’t float on his back, but on his face.",58
243,"So I knowed, then, thatthis warn’t pap, but a woman dressed up in a man’s clothes.",58
244,So I wasuncomfortable again.,58
245,"I judged the old man would turn up againby-and-by, though I wished he wouldn’t.",58
246,"We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned.",59
247,Allthe boys did.,59
248,"We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any people, butonly just pretended.",59
249,"We used to hop out of the woods and go chargingdown on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,but we never hived any of them.",59
250,"Tom Sawyer called the hogs “ingots,”and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,” and we would go to thecave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we hadkilled and marked.",59
251,But I couldn’t see no profit in it.,59
252,"One time Tomsent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called aslogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then hesaid he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcelof Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollowwith two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand“sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds, and they didn’t haveonly a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay inambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.",59
253,"Hesaid we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.",59
254,"He nevercould go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and gunsall scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, andyou might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn’t worth amouthful of ashes more than what they was before.",59
255,"I didn’t believe wecould lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to seethe camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in theambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and downthe hill.",59
256,"But there warn’t no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t nocamels nor no elephants.",59
257,"It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic,and only a primer-class at that.",59
258,"We busted it up, and chased thechildren up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnutsand jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got ahymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made usdrop everything and cut.",59
259,"I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.",60
260,"He said there wasloads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too,and elephants and things.",60
261,"I said, why couldn’t we see them, then?",60
262,"Hesaid if I warn’t so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, Iwould know without asking.",60
263,He said it was all done by enchantment.,60
264,"Hesaid there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they hadturned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite.",60
265,"I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for themagicians.",60
266,Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.,60
267,"“Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and theywould hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson.",61
268,Theyare as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”,61
269,"“Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help _us_—can’t we lickthe other crowd then?”",62
270,“How you going to get them?”,63
271,“I don’t know.,64
272,How do _they_ get them?”,64
273,"“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the geniescome tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around andthe smoke a-rolling, and everything they’re told to do they up and doit.",65
274,"They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots,and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it—or anyother man.”",65
275,“Who makes them tear around so?”,66
276,"“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring.",67
277,"They belong to whoever rubsthe lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he says.",67
278,"If hetells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds, and fillit full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor’sdaughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to do it—and they’vegot to do it before sun-up next morning, too.",67
279,"And more: they’ve got towaltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, youunderstand.”",67
280,"“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keepingthe palace themselves ’stead of fooling them away like that.",68
281,And what’smore—if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I woulddrop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”,68
282,"“How you talk, Huck Finn.",69
283,"Why, you’d _have_ to come when he rubbed it,whether you wanted to or not.”",69
284,“What!,70
285,and I as high as a tree and as big as a church?,70
286,"All right, then;I _would_ come; but I lay I’d make that man climb the highest treethere was in the country.”",70
287,"“Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.",71
288,"You don’t seem toknow anything, somehow—perfect saphead.”",71
289,"I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned Iwould see if there was anything in it.",72
290,"I got an old tin lamp and aniron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweatlike an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’tno use, none of the genies come.",72
291,So then I judged that all that stuffwas only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies.,72
292,"I reckoned he believed in theA-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different.",72
293,It had allthe marks of a Sunday-school.,72
294,CHAPTER IV.,74
295,"Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winternow.",75
296,"I had been to school most all the time and could spell and readand write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up tosix times seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get anyfurther than that if I was to live forever.",75
297,"I don’t take no stock inmathematics, anyway.",75
298,"At first I hated the school, but by-and-by I got so I could stand it.",76
299,"Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I gotnext day done me good and cheered me up.",76
300,So the longer I went to schoolthe easier it got to be.,76
301,"I was getting sort of used to the widow’sways, too, and they warn’t so raspy on me.",76
302,"Living in a house andsleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the coldweather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and sothat was a rest to me.",76
303,"I liked the old ways best, but I was getting soI liked the new ones, too, a little bit.",76
304,"The widow said I was comingalong slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory.",76
305,She said she warn’tashamed of me.,76
306,One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast.,77
307,"Ireached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my leftshoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me,and crossed me off.",77
308,"She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; whata mess you are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me, butthat warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough.",77
309,"I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, andwondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going tobe.",77
310,"There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’tone of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked alonglow-spirited and on the watch-out.",77
311,I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you gothrough the high board fence.,78
312,"There was an inch of new snow on theground, and I seen somebody’s tracks.",78
313,"They had come up from the quarryand stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the gardenfence.",78
314,"It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing around so.",78
315,Icouldn’t make it out.,78
316,"It was very curious, somehow.",78
317,"I was going tofollow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first.",78
318,"I didn’tnotice anything at first, but next I did.",78
319,"There was a cross in the leftboot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.",78
320,I was up in a second and shinning down the hill.,79
321,"I looked over myshoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody.",79
322,I was at JudgeThatcher’s as quick as I could get there.,79
323,He said:,79
324,"“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath.",80
325,Did you come for yourinterest?”,80
326,"“No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”",81
327,"“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in, last night—over a hundred and fiftydollars.",82
328,Quite a fortune for you.,82
329,"You had better let me invest it alongwith your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll spend it.”",82
330,"“No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it.",83
331,"I don’t want it atall—nor the six thousand, nuther.",83
332,I want you to take it; I want to giveit to you—the six thousand and all.”,83
333,He looked surprised.,84
334,He couldn’t seem to make it out.,84
335,He says:,84
336,"“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”",85
337,"I says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please.",86
338,You’ll takeit—won’t you?”,86
339,He says:,87
340,"“Well, I’m puzzled.",88
341,Is something the matter?”,88
342,"“Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me nothing—then I won’t haveto tell no lies.”",89
343,"He studied a while, and then he says:",90
344,“Oho-o!,91
345,I think I see.,91
346,You want to _sell_ all your property to me—notgive it.,91
347,That’s the correct idea.”,91
348,"Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:",92
349,“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ That means I have boughtit of you and paid you for it.,93
350,Here’s a dollar for you.,93
351,Now you signit.”,93
352,"So I signed it, and left.",94
353,"Miss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, whichhad been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to domagic with it.",95
354,"He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowedeverything.",95
355,"So I went to him that night and told him pap was hereagain, for I found his tracks in the snow.",95
356,"What I wanted to know was,what he was going to do, and was he going to stay?",95
357,"Jim got out hishair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up anddropped it on the floor.",95
358,"It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about aninch.",95
359,"Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just thesame.",95
360,"Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it andlistened.",95
361,But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t talk.,95
362,He saidsometimes it wouldn’t talk without money.,95
363,"I told him I had an old slickcounterfeit quarter that warn’t no good because the brass showedthrough the silver a little, and it wouldn’t pass nohow, even if thebrass didn’t show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so thatwould tell on it every time.",95
364,(I reckoned I wouldn’t say nothing aboutthe dollar I got from the judge.),95
365,"I said it was pretty bad money, butmaybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn’t know thedifference.",95
366,"Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he wouldmanage so the hair-ball would think it was good.",95
367,"He said he would splitopen a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep itthere all night, and next morning you couldn’t see no brass, and itwouldn’t feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in aminute, let alone a hair-ball.",95
368,"Well, I knowed a potato would do thatbefore, but I had forgot it.",95
369,"Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listenedagain.",96
370,This time he said the hair-ball was all right.,96
371,He said it wouldtell my whole fortune if I wanted it to.,96
372,"I says, go on.",96
373,"So thehair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me.",96
374,He says:,96
375,“Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne to do.,97

391,CHAPTER V.,100
392,I had shut the door to.,101
393,Then I turned around and there he was.,101
394,"I usedto be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.",101
395,"I reckoned Iwas scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken—that is,after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched,he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn’t scared ofhim worth bothring about.",101
396,"He was most fifty, and he looked it.",102
397,"His hair was long and tangled andgreasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through likehe was behind vines.",102
398,"It was all black, no gray; so was his long,mixed-up whiskers.",102
399,"There warn’t no color in his face, where his faceshowed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a white to makea body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, afish-belly white.",102
400,"As for his clothes—just rags, that was all.",102
401,"He hadone ankle resting on t’other knee; the boot on that foot was busted,and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then.",102
402,"Hishat was laying on the floor—an old black slouch with the top caved in,like a lid.",102
403,"I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chairtilted back a little.",103
404,I set the candle down.,103
405,I noticed the window wasup; so he had clumb in by the shed.,103
406,He kept a-looking me all over.,103
407,By-and-by he says:,103
408,“Starchy clothes—very.,104
409,"You think you’re a good deal of a big-bug,_don’t_ you?”",104
410,"“Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.",105
411,"“Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he.",106
412,“You’ve put onconsiderable many frills since I been away.,106
413,I’ll take you down a pegbefore I get done with you.,106
414,"You’re educated, too, they say—can read andwrite.",106
415,"You think you’re better’n your father, now, don’t you, becausehe can’t?",106
416,_I’ll_ take it out of you.,106

418,“The widow.,107
419,She told me.”,107
420,"“The widow, hey?—and who told the widow she could put in her shovelabout a thing that ain’t none of her business?”",108
421,“Nobody never told her.”,109
422,"“Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle.",110
423,"And looky here—you drop thatschool, you hear?",110
424,I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airsover his own father and let on to be better’n what _he_ is.,110

431,I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and thewars.,111
432,"When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whackwith his hand and knocked it across the house.",111
433,He says:,111
434,“It’s so.,112
435,You can do it.,112
436,I had my doubts when you told me.,112
437,Now lookyhere; you stop that putting on frills.,112
438,I won’t have it.,112

442,"He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, andsays:",113
443,“What’s this?”,114
444,“It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.”,115
445,"He tore it up, and says:",116
446,“I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a cowhide.”,117
447,"He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:",118
448,"“_Ain’t_ you a sweet-scented dandy, though?",119
449,A bed; and bedclothes; anda look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor—and your own fathergot to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard.,119
450,I never see such a son.,119
451,Ibet I’ll take some o’ these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you.,119
452,"Why, there ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich.",119
453,Hey?—how’sthat?”,119
454,“They lie—that’s how.”,120
455,“Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing about all I canstand now—so don’t gimme no sass.,121
456,"I’ve been in town two days, and Ihain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich.",121
457,"I heard about it awaydown the river, too.",121
458,That’s why I come.,121
459,You git me that moneyto-morrow—I want it.”,121
460,“I hain’t got no money.”,122
461,“It’s a lie.,123
462,Judge Thatcher’s got it.,123
463,You git it.,123
464,I want it.”,123
465,"“I hain’t got no money, I tell you.",124
466,You ask Judge Thatcher; he’ll tellyou the same.”,124
467,“All right.,125
468,"I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him pungle, too, or I’ll knowthe reason why.",125
469,"Say, how much you got in your pocket?",125
470,I want it.”,125
471,"“I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to—”",126
472,“It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you just shell itout.”,127
473,"He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he wasgoing down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.",128
474,"When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed mefor putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when Ireckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and toldme to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me andlick me if I didn’t drop that.",128
475,"Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and bullyraggedhim, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t, and thenhe swore he’d make the law force him.",129
476,"The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me awayfrom him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judgethat had just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courtsmustn’t interfere and separate families if they could help it; saidhe’d druther not take a child away from its father.",130
477,So Judge Thatcherand the widow had to quit on the business.,130
478,That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest.,131
479,He said he’d cowhide metill I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money for him.,131
480,"Iborrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and gotdrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carryingon; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till mostmidnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,and jailed him again for a week.",131
481,"But he said _he_ was satisfied; saidhe was boss of his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_.",131
482,When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.,132
483,"So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, andhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and wasjust old pie to him, so to speak.",132
484,"And after supper he talked to himabout temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’dbeen a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turnover a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and hehoped the judge would help him and not look down on him.",132
485,"The judge saidhe could hug him for them words; so _he_ cried, and his wife she criedagain; pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstoodbefore, and the judge said he believed it.",132
486,"The old man said that what aman wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; sothey cried again.",132
487,"And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and heldout his hand, and says:",132
488,"“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.",133
489,"There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no more;it’s the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life, and’ll diebefore he’ll go back.",133
490,You mark them words—don’t forget I said them.,133
491,It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t be afeard.”,133
492,"So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried.",134
493,Thejudge’s wife she kissed it.,134
494,Then the old man he signed a pledge—madehis mark.,134
495,"The judge said it was the holiest time on record, orsomething like that.",134
496,"Then they tucked the old man into a beautifulroom, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he gotpowerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down astanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumbback again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled outagain, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his leftarm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found himafter sun-up.",134
497,And when they come to look at that spare room they had totake soundings before they could navigate it.,134
498,The judge he felt kind of sore.,135
499,"He said he reckoned a body could reformthe old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.",135
500,CHAPTER VI.,137
501,"Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he wentfor Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and hewent for me, too, for not stopping school.",138
502,"He catched me a couple oftimes and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodgedhim or outrun him most of the time.",138
503,"I didn’t want to go to school muchbefore, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap.",138
504,"That law trial was aslow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started onit; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three dollars off of thejudge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.",138
505,Every time he gotmoney he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain aroundtown; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed.,138
506,He was justsuited—this kind of thing was right in his line.,138
507,He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him atlast that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make troublefor him.,139
508,"Well, _wasn’t_ he mad?",139
509,He said he would show who was HuckFinn’s boss.,139
510,"So he watched out for me one day in the spring, andcatched me, and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff, andcrossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn’tno houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thickyou couldn’t find it if you didn’t know where it was.",139
511,"He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off.",140
512,"We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put thekey under his head nights.",140
513,"He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.",140
514,"Every littlewhile he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to theferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and gotdrunk and had a good time, and licked me.",140
515,"The widow she found out whereI was by-and-by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; butpap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after that till Iwas used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the cowhide part.",140
516,"It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smokingand fishing, and no books nor study.",141
517,"Two months or more run along, andmy clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d evergot to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash, and eaton a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and beforever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at youall the time.",141
518,I didn’t want to go back no more.,141
519,"I had stopped cussing,because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to it again becausepap hadn’t no objections.",141
520,"It was pretty good times up in the woodsthere, take it all around.",141
521,"But by-and-by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t standit.",142
522,I was all over welts.,142
523,"He got to going away so much, too, andlocking me in.",142
524,Once he locked me in and was gone three days.,142
525,It wasdreadful lonesome.,142
526,"I judged he had got drownded, and I wasn’t evergoing to get out any more.",142
527,I was scared.,142
528,I made up my mind I would fixup some way to leave there.,142
529,"I had tried to get out of that cabin many atime, but I couldn’t find no way.",142
530,There warn’t a window to it bigenough for a dog to get through.,142
531,I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it wastoo narrow.,142
532,"The door was thick, solid oak slabs.",142
533,"Pap was pretty carefulnot to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; Ireckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, Iwas most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to putin the time.",142
534,But this time I found something at last; I found an oldrusty wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter andthe clapboards of the roof.,142
535,I greased it up and went to work.,142
536,"There wasan old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of thecabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through thechinks and putting the candle out.",142
537,"I got under the table and raised theblanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom logout—big enough to let me through.",142
538,"Well, it was a good long job, but Iwas getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.",142
539,"I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid mysaw, and pretty soon pap come in.",142
540,Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self.,143
541,"He said he wasdown town, and everything was going wrong.",143
542,"His lawyer said he reckonedhe would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started onthe trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and JudgeThatcher knowed how to do it.",143
543,"And he said people allowed there’d beanother trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for myguardian, and they guessed it would win this time.",143
544,"This shook me upconsiderable, because I didn’t want to go back to the widow’s any moreand be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.",143
545,"Then the old mangot to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of,and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn’t skipped any,and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round,including a considerable parcel of people which he didn’t know thenames of, and so called them what’s-his-name when he got to them, andwent right along with his cussing.",143
546,He said he would like to see the widow get me.,144
547,"He said he would watchout, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of aplace six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt tillthey dropped and they couldn’t find me.",144
548,"That made me pretty uneasyagain, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand tillhe got that chance.",144
549,The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got.,145
550,"There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and twonewspapers for wadding, besides some tow.",145
551,"I toted up a load, and wentback and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.",145
552,"I thought it allover, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, andtake to the woods when I run away.",145
553,"I guessed I wouldn’t stay in oneplace, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, andhunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old mannor the widow couldn’t ever find me any more.",145
554,"I judged I would saw outand leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would.",145
555,I got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the oldman hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.,145
556,"I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.",146
557,"WhileI was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort ofwarmed up, and went to ripping again.",146
558,"He had been drunk over in town,and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.",146
559,A bodywould a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud.,146
560,"Whenever his liquorbegun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he says:",146
561,“Call this a govment!,147
562,"why, just look at it and see what it’s like.",147
563,"Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away from him—aman’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety andall the expense of raising.",147
564,"Yes, just as that man has got that sonraised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin’ for_him_ and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him.",147
565,And they call_that_ govment!,147
566,"That ain’t all, nuther.",147
567,The law backs that old JudgeThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o’ my property.,147
568,"Here’s whatthe law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars andup’ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and letshim go round in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog.",147
569,They call thatgovment!,147
570,A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this.,147
571,SometimesI’ve a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all.,147
572,"Yes,and I _told_ ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face.",147
573,"Lots of ’emheard me, and can tell what I said.",147
574,"Says I, for two cents I’d leave theblamed country and never come a-near it agin.",147
575,Them’s the very words.,147
576,"Isays look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and therest of it goes down till it’s below my chin, and then it ain’t rightlya hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o’stove-pipe.",147
577,"Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of thewealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights.",147
578,"“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.",148
579,"Why, looky here.",148
580,"There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as awhite man.",148
581,"He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and theshiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s got as fineclothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and asilver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State.",148
582,Andwhat do you think?,148
583,"They said he was a p’fessor in a college, and couldtalk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything.",148
584,And that ain’t thewust.,148
585,They said he could _vote_ when he was at home.,148
586,"Well, that let meout.",148
587,"Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to?",148
588,"It was ’lection day,and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to getthere; but when they told me there was a State in this country wherethey’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out.",148
589,I says I’ll never vote agin.,148
590,Them’s the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country mayrot for all me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live.,148
591,"And to see thecool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the road if I hadn’tshoved him out o’ the way.",148
592,"I says to the people, why ain’t this niggerput up at auction and sold?—that’s what I want to know.",148
593,And what do youreckon they said?,148
594,"Why, they said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been inthe State six months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet.",148
595,"There,now—that’s a specimen.",148
596,They call that a govment that can’t sell a freenigger till he’s been in the State six months.,148
597,"Here’s a govment thatcalls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is agovment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six whole months beforeit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirtedfree nigger, and—”",148
598,"Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs wastaking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork andbarked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kindof language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he givethe tub some, too, all along, here and there.",149
599,"He hopped around thecabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holdingfirst one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with hisleft foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick.",149
600,"But itwarn’t good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple ofhis toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howlthat fairly made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, androlled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid overanything he had ever done previous.",149
601,He said so his own self afterwards.,149
602,"He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laidover him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.",149
603,"After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there fortwo drunks and one delirium tremens.",150
604,That was always his word.,150
605,"I judgedhe would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal thekey, or saw myself out, one or t’other.",150
606,"He drank and drank, and tumbleddown on his blankets by-and-by; but luck didn’t run my way.",150
607,"He didn’tgo sound asleep, but was uneasy.",150
608,He groaned and moaned and thrashedaround this way and that for a long time.,150
609,"At last I got so sleepy Icouldn’t keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed whatI was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.",150
610,"I don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was anawful scream and I was up.",151
611,"There was pap looking wild, and skippingaround every which way and yelling about snakes.",151
612,"He said they wascrawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and sayone had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes.",151
613,"He startedand run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off!",151
614,take himoff!,151
615,he’s biting me on the neck!” I never see a man look so wild in theeyes.,151
616,"Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then herolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way,and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming andsaying there was devils a-hold of him.",151
617,"He wore out by-and-by, and laidstill a while, moaning.",151
618,"Then he laid stiller, and didn’t make a sound.",151
619,"I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and itseemed terrible still.",151
620,He was laying over by the corner.,151
621,"By-and-by heraised up part way and listened, with his head to one side.",151
622,"He says,very low:",151
623,“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp; they’re comingafter me; but I won’t go.,152
624,"Oh, they’re here!",152
625,don’t touch me—don’t!,152
626,handsoff—they’re cold; let go.,152
627,"Oh, let a poor devil alone!”",152
628,"Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let himalone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in underthe old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying.",153
629,Icould hear him through the blanket.,153
630,"By-and-by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and hesee me and went for me.",154
631,"He chased me round and round the place with aclasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would killme, and then I couldn’t come for him no more.",154
632,"I begged, and told him Iwas only Huck; but he laughed _such_ a screechy laugh, and roared andcussed, and kept on chasing me up.",154
633,"Once when I turned short and dodgedunder his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between myshoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quickas lightning, and saved myself.",154
634,"Pretty soon he was all tired out, anddropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest aminute and then kill me.",154
635,"He put his knife under him, and said he wouldsleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.",154
636,So he dozed off pretty soon.,155
637,"By-and-by I got the old split-bottom chairand clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got downthe gun.",155
638,"I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, thenI laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set downbehind it to wait for him to stir.",155
639,And how slow and still the time diddrag along.,155
640,CHAPTER VII.,157
641,“Git up!,158
642,What you ’bout?”,158
643,"I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was.",159
644,"Itwas after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep.",159
645,"Pap was standing over melooking sour and sick, too.",159
646,He says:,159
647,“What you doin’ with this gun?”,160
648,"I judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so Isays:",161
649,"“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”",162
650,“Why didn’t you roust me out?”,163
651,"“Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”",164
652,"“Well, all right.",165
653,"Don’t stand there palavering all day, but out withyou and see if there’s a fish on the lines for breakfast.",165
654,I’ll be alongin a minute.”,165
655,"He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank.",166
656,"I noticedsome pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling ofbark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise.",166
657,I reckoned I would havegreat times now if I was over at the town.,166
658,"The June rise used to bealways luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comescordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logstogether; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to thewood-yards and the sawmill.",166
659,I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one outfor what the rise might fetch along.,167
660,"Well, all at once here comes acanoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, ridinghigh like a duck.",167
661,"I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.",167
662,"I just expectedthere’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done thatto fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they’draise up and laugh at him.",167
663,But it warn’t so this time.,167
664,"It was adrift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.",167
665,"ThinksI, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s worth ten dollars.",167
666,"But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight yet, and as I was runningher into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines andwillows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d hide her good, and then,’stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I’d go down the riverabout fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such arough time tramping on foot.",167
667,"It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old mancoming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and lookedaround a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path apiece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun.",168
668,So he hadn’t seenanything.,168
669,When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.,169
670,"He abusedme a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, andthat was what made me so long.",169
671,"I knowed he would see I was wet, andthen he would be asking questions.",169
672,We got five catfish off the linesand went home.,169
673,"While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being aboutwore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep papand the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thingthan trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; yousee, all kinds of things might happen.",170
674,"Well, I didn’t see no way for awhile, but by-and-by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel ofwater, and he says:",170
675,"“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, youhear?",171
676,That man warn’t here for no good.,171
677,I’d a shot him.,171
678,"Next time youroust me out, you hear?”",171
679,Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had beensaying give me the very idea I wanted.,172
680,"I says to myself, I can fix itnow so nobody won’t think of following me.",172
681,About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank.,173
682,"Theriver was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on therise.",173
683,By-and-by along comes part of a log raft—nine logs fast together.,173
684,We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.,173
685,Then we had dinner.,173
686,"Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catchmore stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style.",173
687,Nine logs was enough for onetime; he must shove right over to town and sell.,173
688,"So he locked me in andtook the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.",173
689,I judged he wouldn’t come back that night.,173
690,"I waited till I reckoned hehad got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on thatlog again.",173
691,Before he was t’other side of the river I was out of thehole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.,173
692,"I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid,and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done thesame with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.",174
693,"I took all the coffeeand sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I tookthe bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw andtwo blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.",174
694,I took fish-lines andmatches and other things—everything that was worth a cent.,174
695,I cleanedout the place.,174
696,"I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t any, only the one outat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.",174
697,"I fetchedout the gun, and now I was done.",174
698,I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and draggingout so many things.,175
699,"So I fixed that as good as I could from the outsideby scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness andthe sawdust.",175
700,"Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and puttwo rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bentup at that place and didn’t quite touch ground.",175
701,"If you stood four orfive foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you wouldn’t never noticeit; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn’t likelyanybody would go fooling around there.",175
702,"It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track.",176
703,Ifollowed around to see.,176
704,I stood on the bank and looked out over theriver.,176
705,All safe.,176
706,"So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soonwent wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairiefarms.",176
707,I shot this fellow and took him into camp.,176
708,I took the axe and smashed in the door.,177
709,I beat it and hacked itconsiderable a-doing it.,177
710,"I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearlyto the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him downon the ground to bleed; I say ground because it _was_ ground—hardpacked, and no boards.",177
711,"Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot ofbig rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, anddragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river anddumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight.",177
712,You could easy see thatsomething had been dragged over the ground.,177
713,"I did wish Tom Sawyer wasthere; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, andthrow in the fancy touches.",177
714,Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyerin such a thing as that.,177
715,"Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, andstuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.",178
716,Then I tookup the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’tdrip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him intothe river.,178
717,Now I thought of something else.,178
718,"So I went and got the bagof meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.",178
719,"I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in thebottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and forks on theplace—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.",178
720,"ThenI carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and throughthe willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five milewide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season.",178
721,"There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side thatwent miles away, I don’t know where, but it didn’t go to the river.",178
722,Themeal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.,178
723,"Idropped pap’s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been doneby accident.",178
724,"Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, soit wouldn’t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.",178
725,"It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under somewillows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.",179
726,"Imade fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by-and-by laiddown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.",179
727,"I says to myself,they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and thendrag the river for me.",179
728,And they’ll follow that meal track to the lakeand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbersthat killed me and took the things.,179
729,They won’t ever hunt the river foranything but my dead carcass.,179
730,"They’ll soon get tired of that, and won’tbother no more about me.",179
731,All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.,179
732,"Jackson’s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,and nobody ever comes there.",179
733,"And then I can paddle over to town nights,and slink around and pick up things I want.",179
734,Jackson’s Island’s theplace.,179
735,"I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.",180
736,When Iwoke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute.,180
737,"I set up and lookedaround, a little scared.",180
738,Then I remembered.,180
739,The river looked miles andmiles across.,180
740,"The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logsthat went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out fromshore.",180
741,"Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.",180
742,You know what I mean—I don’t know the words to put it in.,180
743,"I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch andstart when I heard a sound away over the water.",181
744,I listened.,181
745,Pretty soonI made it out.,181
746,It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes fromoars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night.,181
747,"I peeped out throughthe willow branches, and there it was—a skiff, away across the water.",181
748,Icouldn’t tell how many was in it.,181
749,"It kept a-coming, and when it wasabreast of me I see there warn’t but one man in it.",181
750,"Think’s I, maybeit’s pap, though I warn’t expecting him.",181
751,"He dropped below me with thecurrent, and by-and-by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.",181
752,"Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid hisoars.",181
753,I didn’t lose no time.,182
754,The next minute I was a-spinning down streamsoft but quick in the shade of the bank.,182
755,"I made two mile and a half,and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle ofthe river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing,and people might see me and hail me.",182
756,"I got out amongst the driftwood,and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.",182
757,"I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, lookingaway into the sky; not a cloud in it.",183
758,The sky looks ever so deep whenyou lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.,183
759,And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!,183
760,I heard peopletalking at the ferry landing.,183
761,"I heard what they said, too—every word ofit.",183
762,One man said it was getting towards the long days and the shortnights now.,183
763,"T’other one said _this_ warn’t one of the short ones, hereckoned—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and theylaughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, andlaughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and saidlet him alone.",183
764,The first fellow said he ’lowed to tell it to his oldwoman—she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn’tnothing to some things he had said in his time.,183
765,"I heard one man say itwas nearly three o’clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more thanabout a week longer.",183
766,"After that the talk got further and further away,and I couldn’t make out the words any more; but I could hear themumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.",183
767,I was away below the ferry now.,184
768,"I rose up, and there was Jackson’sIsland, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered andstanding up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid,like a steamboat without any lights.",184
769,There warn’t any signs of the barat the head—it was all under water now.,184
770,It didn’t take me long to get there.,185
771,"I shot past the head at a rippingrate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water andlanded on the side towards the Illinois shore.",185
772,I run the canoe into adeep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willowbranches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoefrom the outside.,185
773,"I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and lookedout on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.",186
774,"Amonstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming alongdown, with a lantern in the middle of it.",186
775,"I watched it come creepingdown, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,“Stern oars, there!",186
776,heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just asplain as if the man was by my side.,186
777,"There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods,and laid down for a nap before breakfast.",187
778,CHAPTER VIII.,189
779,The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eighto’clock.,190
780,"I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking aboutthings, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.",190
781,"Icould see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big treesall about, and gloomy in there amongst them.",190
782,"There was freckled placeson the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and thefreckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a littlebreeze up there.",190
783,A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at mevery friendly.,190
784,I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn’t want to get up and cookbreakfast.,191
785,"Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deepsound of “boom!” away up the river.",191
786,"I rouses up, and rests on my elbowand listens; pretty soon I hears it again.",191
787,"I hopped up, and went andlooked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke layingon the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry.",191
788,And there was theferry-boat full of people floating along down.,191
789,I knowed what was thematter now.,191
790,“Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat’sside.,191
791,"You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make mycarcass come to the top.",191
792,"I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a fire,because they might see the smoke.",192
793,So I set there and watched thecannon-smoke and listened to the boom.,192
794,"The river was a mile wide there,and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a goodenough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite toeat.",192
795,"Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver inloaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to thedrownded carcass and stop there.",192
796,"So, says I, I’ll keep a lookout, andif any of them’s floating around after me I’ll give them a show.",192
797,"Ichanged to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I couldhave, and I warn’t disappointed.",192
798,"A big double loaf come along, and Imost got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated outfurther.",192
799,Of course I was where the current set in the closest to theshore—I knowed enough for that.,192
800,"But by-and-by along comes another one,and this time I won.",192
801,"I took out the plug and shook out the little dabof quicksilver, and set my teeth in.",192
802,It was “baker’s bread”—what thequality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.,192
803,"I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munchingthe bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.",193
804,Andthen something struck me.,193
805,"I says, now I reckon the widow or the parsonor somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has goneand done it.",193
806,"So there ain’t no doubt but there is something in thatthing—that is, there’s something in it when a body like the widow orthe parson prays, but it don’t work for me, and I reckon it don’t workfor only just the right kind.",193
807,"I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.",194
808,"Theferry-boat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have achance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she wouldcome in close, where the bread did.",194
809,"When she’d got pretty well alongdown towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out thebread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.",194
810,Where the log forked I could peep through.,194
811,"By-and-by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could arun out a plank and walked ashore.",195
812,Most everybody was on the boat.,195
813,"Pap,and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom Sawyer,and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.",195
814,"Everybodywas talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:",195
815,"“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’swashed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.",196
816,"Ihope so, anyway.”",196
817,I didn’t hope so.,197
818,"They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearlyin my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.",197
819,"I could seethem first-rate, but they couldn’t see me.",197
820,Then the captain sung out:,197
821,"“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me thatit made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke,and I judged I was gone.",198
822,"If they’d a had some bullets in, I reckonthey’d a got the corpse they was after.",198
823,"Well, I see I warn’t hurt,thanks to goodness.",198
824,The boat floated on and went out of sight aroundthe shoulder of the island.,198
825,"I could hear the booming now and then,further and further off, and by-and-by, after an hour, I didn’t hear itno more.",198
826,The island was three mile long.,198
827,"I judged they had got to thefoot, and was giving it up.",198
828,But they didn’t yet a while.,198
829,"They turnedaround the foot of the island and started up the channel on theMissouri side, under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.",198
830,Icrossed over to that side and watched them.,198
831,When they got abreast thehead of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missourishore and went home to the town.,198
832,I knowed I was all right now.,199
833,Nobody else would come a-hunting afterme.,199
834,I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in thethick woods.,199
835,I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put mythings under so the rain couldn’t get at them.,199
836,"I catched a catfish andhaggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my campfire and had supper.",199
837,Then I set out a line to catch some fish forbreakfast.,199
838,"When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty wellsatisfied; but by-and-by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and seton the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted thestars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;there ain’t no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; youcan’t stay so, you soon get over it.",200
839,And so for three days and nights.,201
840,No difference—just the same thing.,201
841,But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.,201
842,"I wasboss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know allabout it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.",201
843,"I found plentystrawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and greenrazberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.",201
844,"Theywould all come handy by-and-by, I judged.",201
845,"Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t farfrom the foot of the island.",202
846,"I had my gun along, but I hadn’t shotnothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nighhome.",202
847,"About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, andit went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it,trying to get a shot at it.",202
848,"I clipped along, and all of a sudden Ibounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.",202
849,My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.,203
850,"I never waited for to lookfurther, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes asfast as ever I could.",203
851,"Every now and then I stopped a second amongst thethick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t hearnothing else.",203
852,"I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;and so on, and so on.",203
853,"If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trodon a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one ofmy breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.",203
854,"When I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t much sandin my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling around.",204
855,"So Igot all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like anold last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.",204
856,"I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, Ididn’t hear nothing—I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as athousand things.",205
857,"Well, I couldn’t stay up there forever; so at last Igot down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all thetime.",205
858,All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over frombreakfast.,205
859,By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.,206
860,So when it was good anddark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to theIllinois bank—about a quarter of a mile.,206
861,"I went out in the woods andcooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there allnight when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says tomyself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices.",206
862,"I goteverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creepingthrough the woods to see what I could find out.",206
863,I hadn’t got far when Ihear a man say:,206
864,“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is aboutbeat out.,207
865,Let’s look around.”,207
866,"I didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.",208
867,"I tied up in theold place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.",208
868,I didn’t sleep much.,209
869,"I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking.",209
870,And every timeI waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.,209
871,So the sleep didn’tdo me no good.,209
872,"By-and-by I says to myself, I can’t live this way; I’ma-going to find out who it is that’s here on the island with me; I’llfind it out or bust.",209
873,"Well, I felt better right off.",209
874,"So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, andthen let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.",210
875,"The moon wasshining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.",210
876,"Ipoked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and soundasleep.",210
877,"Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.",210
878,"Alittle ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good assaying the night was about done.",210
879,I give her a turn with the paddle andbrung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into theedge of the woods.,210
880,"I sat down there on a log, and looked out throughthe leaves.",210
881,"I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin toblanket the river.",210
882,"But in a little while I see a pale streak over thetreetops, and knowed the day was coming.",210
883,"So I took my gun and slippedoff towards where I had run across that camp fire, stopping everyminute or two to listen.",210
884,But I hadn’t no luck somehow; I couldn’t seemto find the place.,210
885,"But by-and-by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse offire away through the trees.",210
886,"I went for it, cautious and slow.",210
887,"By-and-by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man onthe ground.",210
888,It most give me the fan-tods.,210
889,"He had a blanket around hishead, and his head was nearly in the fire.",210
890,"I set there behind a clumpof bushes, in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.",210
891,Itwas getting gray daylight now.,210
892,"Pretty soon he gapped and stretchedhimself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim!",210
893,I bet Iwas glad to see him.,210
894,I says:,210
895,"“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.",211
896,He bounced up and stared at me wild.,212
897,"Then he drops down on his knees,and puts his hands together and says:",212
898,“Doan’ hurt me—don’t!,213
899,I hain’t ever done no harm to a ghos’.,213
900,"I alwuzliked dead people, en done all I could for ’em.",213
901,"You go en git in deriver agin, whah you b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ’at ’uzawluz yo’ fren’.”",213
902,"Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead.",214
903,I was ever soglad to see Jim.,214
904,I warn’t lonesome now.,214
905,I told him I warn’t afraid of_him_ telling the people where I was.,214
906,"I talked along, but he only setthere and looked at me; never said nothing.",214
907,Then I says:,214
908,“It’s good daylight.,215
909,Le’s get breakfast.,215
910,Make up your camp fire good.”,215
911,“What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sichtruck?,216
912,"But you got a gun, hain’t you?",216
913,Den we kin git sumfn better denstrawbries.”,216
914,"“Strawberries and such truck,” I says.",217
915,“Is that what you live on?”,217
916,"“I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.",218
917,"“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”",219
918,“I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”,220
919,"“What, all that time?”",221
920,“Yes—indeedy.”,222
921,“And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”,223
922,"“No, sah—nuffn else.”",224
923,"“Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”",225
924,“I reck’n I could eat a hoss.,226
925,I think I could.,226
926,How long you ben on deislan’?”,226
927,“Since the night I got killed.”,227
928,“No!,228
929,"W’y, what has you lived on?",228
930,But you got a gun.,228
931,"Oh, yes, you got agun.",228
932,Dat’s good.,228
933,Now you kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”,228
934,"So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in agrassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon andcoffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and thenigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all donewith witchcraft.",229
935,"I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned himwith his knife, and fried him.",229
936,When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.,230
937,"Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.",230
938,"Thenwhen we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.",230
939,By-and-byJim says:,230
940,"“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty ef itwarn’t you?”",231
941,"Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart.",232
942,He said TomSawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had.,232
943,Then I says:,232
944,"“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”",233
945,"He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute.",234
946,Then hesays:,234
947,“Maybe I better not tell.”,235
948,"“Why, Jim?”",236
949,"“Well, dey’s reasons.",237
950,"But you wouldn’ tell on me ef I uz to tell you,would you, Huck?”",237
951,"“Blamed if I would, Jim.”",238
952,"“Well, I b’lieve you, Huck.",239
953,I—I _run off_.”,239
954,“Jim!”,240
955,"“But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said you wouldn’tell, Huck.”",241
956,"“Well, I did.",242
957,"I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to it.",242
958,"Honest _injun_,I will.",242
959,People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me forkeeping mum—but that don’t make no difference.,242
960,"I ain’t a-going to tell,and I ain’t a-going back there, anyways.",242
961,"So, now, le’s know all aboutit.”",242
962,"“Well, you see, it ’uz dis way.",243
963,"Ole missus—dat’s Miss Watson—she peckson me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said shewouldn’ sell me down to Orleans.",243
964,"But I noticed dey wuz a nigger traderroun’ de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy.",243
965,"Well, onenight I creeps to de do’ pooty late, en de do’ warn’t quite shet, en Ihear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans,but she didn’ want to, but she could git eight hund’d dollars for me,en it ’uz sich a big stack o’ money she couldn’ resis’.",243
966,"De widder shetry to git her to say she wouldn’ do it, but I never waited to hear deres’.",243
967,"I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.",243
968,"“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en ’spec to steal a skift ’long desho’ som’ers ’bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hidin de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody togo ’way.",244
969,"Well, I wuz dah all night.",244
970,Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time.,244
971,"’Long ’bout six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight ernine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ pap come overto de town en say you’s killed.",244
972,Dese las’ skifts wuz full o’ ladies engenlmen a-goin’ over for to see de place.,244

977,"De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out entake holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.",245
978,"“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went ’bout twomile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses.",246
979,I’d made up my mine ’boutwhat I’s agwyne to do.,246
980,"You see, ef I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot,de dogs ’ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss datskift, you see, en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther side, enwhah to pick up my track.",246
981,"So I says, a raff is what I’s arter; it doan’_make_ no track.",246
982,"“I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so I wade’ in en shove’a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n half way acrost de river, en got in’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ my head down low, en kinder swum agin decurrent tell de raff come along.",247

1001,"You’ve had to keep in the woods all the time, ofcourse.",251
1002,Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”,251
1003,"“Oh, yes.",252
1004,I knowed dey was arter you.,252
1005,I see um go by heah—watched umthoo de bushes.”,252
1006,"Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time andlighting.",253
1007,Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.,253
1008,"He said it was asign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was thesame way when young birds done it.",253
1009,"I was going to catch some of them,but Jim wouldn’t let me.",253
1010,He said it was death.,253
1011,"He said his father laidmighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old grannysaid his father would die, and he did.",253
1012,"And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook fordinner, because that would bring bad luck.",254
1013,The same if you shook thetable-cloth after sundown.,254
1014,"And he said if a man owned a beehive andthat man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up nextmorning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die.",254
1015,"Jim said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that, becauseI had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t sting me.",254
1016,"I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them.",255
1017,Jimknowed all kinds of signs.,255
1018,He said he knowed most everything.,255
1019,"I said itlooked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked himif there warn’t any good-luck signs.",255
1020,He says:,255
1021,“Mighty few—an’ _dey_ ain’t no use to a body.,256
1022,What you want to knowwhen good luck’s a-comin’ for?,256
1023,"Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Efyou’s got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s agwyne tobe rich.",256
1024,"Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase it’s so furahead.",256
1025,"You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a long time fust, en so youmight git discourage’ en kill yo’sef ’f you didn’ know by de sign datyou gwyne to be rich bymeby.”",256
1026,"“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”",257
1027,“What’s de use to ax dat question?,258
1028,Don’t you see I has?”,258
1029,"“Well, are you rich?”",259
1030,"“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin.",260
1031,"Wunst I hadfoteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted out.”",260
1032,"“What did you speculate in, Jim?”",261
1033,"“Well, fust I tackled stock.”",262
1034,“What kind of stock?”,263
1035,"“Why, live stock—cattle, you know.",264
1036,I put ten dollars in a cow.,264
1037,But Iain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock.,264
1038,De cow up ’n’ died on myhan’s.”,264
1039,“So you lost the ten dollars.”,265
1040,"“No, I didn’t lose it all.",266
1041,I on’y los’ ’bout nine of it.,266
1042,I sole de hideen taller for a dollar en ten cents.”,266
1043,“You had five dollars and ten cents left.,267
1044,Did you speculate any more?”,267
1045,“Yes.,268
1046,You know that one-laigged nigger dat b’longs to old MistoBradish?,268
1047,"Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollarwould git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year.",268
1048,"Well, all de niggerswent in, but dey didn’t have much.",268
1049,I wuz de on’y one dat had much.,268
1050,"So Istuck out for mo’ dan fo’ dollars, en I said ’f I didn’ git it I’dstart a bank mysef.",268
1051,"Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out erde business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for two banks,so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at deen’ er de year.",268
1052,“So I done it.,269
1053,Den I reck’n’d I’d inves’ de thirty-five dollars rightoff en keep things a-movin’.,269
1054,"Dey wuz a nigger name’ Bob, dat hadketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn’ know it; en I bought it off’nhim en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en’ er de yearcome; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex day deone-laigged nigger say de bank’s busted.",269
1055,So dey didn’ none uv us git nomoney.”,269
1056,"“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”",270
1057,"“Well, I ’uz gwyne to spen’ it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole meto give it to a nigger name’ Balum—Balum’s Ass dey call him for short;he’s one er dem chuckleheads, you know.",271
1058,"But he’s lucky, dey say, en Isee I warn’t lucky.",271
1059,De dream say let Balum inves’ de ten cents en he’dmake a raise for me.,271
1060,"Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz inchurch he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po’ len’ to deLord, en boun’ to git his money back a hund’d times.",271
1061,"So Balum he tucken give de ten cents to de po’, en laid low to see what wuz gwyne tocome of it.”",271
1062,"“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”",272
1063,“Nuffn never come of it.,273
1064,I couldn’ manage to k’leck dat money no way;en Balum he couldn’.,273
1065,I ain’ gwyne to len’ no mo’ money ’dout I see desecurity.,273
1066,"Boun’ to git yo’ money back a hund’d times, de preacher says!",273
1067,"Ef I could git de ten _cents_ back, I’d call it squah, en be glad er dechanst.”",273
1068,"“Well, it’s all right anyway, Jim, long as you’re going to be richagain some time or other.”",274
1069,"“Yes; en I’s rich now, come to look at it.",275
1070,"I owns mysef, en I’s wutheight hund’d dollars.",275
1071,"I wisht I had de money, I wouldn’ want no mo’.”",275
1072,CHAPTER IX.,277
1073,"I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the islandthat I’d found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a milewide.",278
1074,"This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foothigh.",279
1075,"We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steepand the bushes so thick.",279
1076,"We tramped and clumb around all over it, andby-and-by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top onthe side towards Illinois.",279
1077,"The cavern was as big as two or three roomsbunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.",279
1078,It was cool inthere.,279
1079,"Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said wedidn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.",279
1080,"Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the trapsin the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to theisland, and they would never find us without dogs.",280
1081,"And, besides, hesaid them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I wantthe things to get wet?",280
1082,"So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,and lugged all the traps up there.",281
1083,"Then we hunted up a place close byto hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.",281
1084,"We took some fish offof the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.",281
1085,"The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on oneside of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and agood place to build a fire on.",282
1086,So we built it there and cooked dinner.,282
1087,"We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner inthere.",283
1088,We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.,283
1089,"Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so thebirds was right about it.",283
1090,"Directly it begun to rain, and it rained likeall fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so.",283
1091,It was one of theseregular summer storms.,283
1092,"It would get so dark that it looked allblue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by sothick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; andhere would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turnup the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of agust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms asif they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest andblackest—_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a littleglimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin againin a second, and now you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards theunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs—whereit’s long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.",283
1093,"“Jim, this is nice,” I says.",284
1094,“I wouldn’t want to be nowhere else buthere.,284
1095,Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread.”,284
1096,"“Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ’f it hadn’t a ben for Jim.",285
1097,"You’d a bendown dah in de woods widout any dinner, en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too;dat you would, honey.",285
1098,"Chickens knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so dode birds, chile.”",285
1099,"The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till atlast it was over the banks.",286
1100,The water was three or four foot deep onthe island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.,286
1101,"On that sideit was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the sameold distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was just awall of high bluffs.",286
1102,"Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mightycool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.",287
1103,"We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vineshung so thick we had to back away and go some other way.",287
1104,"Well, on everyold broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things;and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame,on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put yourhand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—theywould slide off in the water.",287
1105,The ridge our cavern was in was full ofthem.,287
1106,We could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them.,287
1107,One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pineplanks.,288
1108,"It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,and the top stood above water six or seven inches—a solid, level floor.",288
1109,"We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let themgo; we didn’t show ourselves in daylight.",288
1110,"Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just beforedaylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.",289
1111,"She was atwo-story, and tilted over considerable.",289
1112,We paddled out and gotaboard—clumb in at an upstairs window.,289
1113,"But it was too dark to see yet,so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.",289
1114,The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.,290
1115,Thenwe looked in at the window.,290
1116,"We could make out a bed, and a table, andtwo old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and therewas clothes hanging against the wall.",290
1117,There was something laying on thefloor in the far corner that looked like a man.,290
1118,So Jim says:,290
1119,"“Hello, you!”",291
1120,But it didn’t budge.,292
1121,"So I hollered again, and then Jim says:",292
1122,“De man ain’t asleep—he’s dead.,293
1123,You hold still—I’ll go en see.”,293
1124,"He went, and bent down and looked, and says:",294
1125,“It’s a dead man.,295
1126,"Yes, indeedy; naked, too.",295
1127,He’s ben shot in de back.,295
1128,Ireck’n he’s ben dead two er three days.,295
1129,"Come in, Huck, but doan’ lookat his face—it’s too gashly.”",295
1130,I didn’t look at him at all.,296
1131,"Jim throwed some old rags over him, but heneedn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him.",296
1132,"There was heaps of oldgreasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the wallswas the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.",296
1133,"There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and somewomen’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s clothing,too.",296
1134,We put the lot into the canoe—it might come good.,296
1135,"There was aboy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.",296
1136,"And therewas a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for ababy to suck.",296
1137,"We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.",296
1138,"There was aseedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.",296
1139,"Theystood open, but there warn’t nothing left in them that was any account.",296
1140,"The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in ahurry, and warn’t fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.",296
1141,"We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, anda bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot oftallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, anda ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pinsand beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and ahatchet and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little fingerwith some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leatherdog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’thave no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerablegood curry-comb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a woodenleg.",297
1142,"The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a goodenough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim,and we couldn’t find the other one, though we hunted all around.",297
1143,"And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.",298
1144,"When we was ready toshove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it waspretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up withthe quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger agood ways off.",298
1145,"I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted downmost a half a mile doing it.",298
1146,"I crept up the dead water under the bank,and hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody.",298
1147,We got home all safe.,298
1148,CHAPTER X.,300
1149,"After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out howhe come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to.",301
1150,"He said it would fetchbad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he said aman that warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting around than onethat was planted and comfortable.",301
1151,"That sounded pretty reasonable, so Ididn’t say no more; but I couldn’t keep from studying over it andwishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.",301
1152,"We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silversewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat.",302
1153,"Jim said he reckonedthe people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d a knowed themoney was there they wouldn’t a left it.",302
1154,"I said I reckoned they killedhim, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about that.",302
1155,I says:,302
1156,“Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched inthe snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day beforeyesterday?,303
1157,You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch asnake-skin with my hands.,303
1158,"Well, here’s your bad luck!",303
1159,We’ve raked inall this truck and eight dollars besides.,303
1160,"I wish we could have some badluck like this every day, Jim.”",303
1161,"“Never you mind, honey, never you mind.",304
1162,Don’t you git too peart.,304
1163,It’sa-comin’.,304
1164,"Mind I tell you, it’s a-comin’.”",304
1165,"It did come, too.",305
1166,It was a Tuesday that we had that talk.,305
1167,"Well, afterdinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of theridge, and got out of tobacco.",305
1168,"I went to the cavern to get some, andfound a rattlesnake in there.",305
1169,"I killed him, and curled him up on thefoot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d be some funwhen Jim found him there.",305
1170,"Well, by night I forgot all about the snake,and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a lightthe snake’s mate was there, and bit him.",305
1171,"He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was thevarmint curled up and ready for another spring.",306
1172,"I laid him out in asecond with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pourit down.",306
1173,"He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.",307
1174,That allcomes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever youleave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.,307
1175,"Jimtold me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skinthe body and roast a piece of it.",307
1176,"I done it, and he eat it and said itwould help cure him.",307
1177,"He made me take off the rattles and tie themaround his wrist, too.",307
1178,He said that that would help.,307
1179,"Then I slid outquiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for Iwarn’t going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I couldhelp it.",307
1180,"Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of hishead and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himselfhe went to sucking at the jug again.",308
1181,"His foot swelled up pretty big,and so did his leg; but by-and-by the drunk begun to come, and so Ijudged he was all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake thanpap’s whisky.",308
1182,Jim was laid up for four days and nights.,309
1183,Then the swelling was allgone and he was around again.,309
1184,"I made up my mind I wouldn’t ever takea-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what hadcome of it.",309
1185,Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.,309
1186,And hesaid that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe wehadn’t got to the end of it yet.,309
1187,He said he druther see the new moonover his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up asnake-skin in his hand.,309
1188,"Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your leftshoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.",309
1189,"Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less thantwo years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spreadhimself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; andthey slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buriedhim so, so they say, but I didn’t see it.",309
1190,Pap told me.,309
1191,"But anyway itall come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.",309
1192,"Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banksagain; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the bighooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was asbig as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over twohundred pounds.",310
1193,"We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung usinto Illinois.",310
1194,We just set there and watched him rip and tear aroundtill he drownded.,310
1195,"We found a brass button in his stomach and a roundball, and lots of rubbage.",310
1196,"We split the ball open with the hatchet, andthere was a spool in it.",310
1197,"Jim said he’d had it there a long time, tocoat it over so and make a ball of it.",310
1198,"It was as big a fish as was evercatched in the Mississippi, I reckon.",310
1199,Jim said he hadn’t ever seen abigger one.,310
1200,He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.,310
1201,Theypeddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there;everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white as snow and makes agood fry.,310
1202,"Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get astirring up some way.",311
1203,I said I reckoned I would slip over the river andfind out what was going on.,311
1204,Jim liked that notion; but he said I mustgo in the dark and look sharp.,311
1205,"Then he studied it over and said,couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?",311
1206,"That was a good notion, too.",311
1207,"So we shortened up one of the calicogowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.",311
1208,"Jimhitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.",311
1209,"I put on thesun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look inand see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.",311
1210,"Jim saidnobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.",311
1211,"I practiced aroundall day to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do prettywell in them, only Jim said I didn’t walk like a girl; and he said Imust quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.",311
1212,"I tooknotice, and done better.",311
1213,I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.,312
1214,"I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, andthe drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.",313
1215,Itied up and started along the bank.,313
1216,"There was a light burning in alittle shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I wonderedwho had took up quarters there.",313
1217,I slipped up and peeped in at thewindow.,313
1218,There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by acandle that was on a pine table.,313
1219,"I didn’t know her face; she was astranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that town that I didn’tknow.",313
1220,"Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraidI had come; people might know my voice and find me out.",313
1221,"But if thiswoman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all Iwanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind Iwouldn’t forget I was a girl.",313
1222,CHAPTER XI.,315
1223,"“Come in,” says the woman, and I did.",316
1224,She says: “Take a cheer.”,316
1225,I done it.,317
1226,"She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:",317
1227,“What might your name be?”,318
1228,“Sarah Williams.”,319
1229,“Where ’bouts do you live?,320
1230,In this neighborhood?”,320
1231,“No’m.,321
1232,"In Hookerville, seven mile below.",321
1233,I’ve walked all the way andI’m all tired out.”,321
1234,"“Hungry, too, I reckon.",322
1235,I’ll find you something.”,322
1236,"“No’m, I ain’t hungry.",323
1237,I was so hungry I had to stop two miles belowhere at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more.,323
1238,It’s what makes me so late.,323
1239,"My mother’s down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come totell my uncle Abner Moore.",323
1240,"He lives at the upper end of the town, shesays.",323
1241,I hain’t ever been here before.,323
1242,Do you know him?”,323
1243,“No; but I don’t know everybody yet.,324
1244,I haven’t lived here quite twoweeks.,324
1245,It’s a considerable ways to the upper end of the town.,324
1246,Youbetter stay here all night.,324
1247,Take off your bonnet.”,324
1248,"“No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go on.",325
1249,I ain’t afearedof the dark.”,325
1250,"She said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be inby-and-by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along withme.",326
1251,"Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relationsup the river, and her relations down the river, and about how muchbetter off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d made amistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and so on andso on, till I was afeard _I_ had made a mistake coming to her to findout what was going on in the town; but by-and-by she dropped on to papand the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter rightalong.",326
1252,"She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousanddollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot hewas, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I wasmurdered.",326
1253,I says:,326
1254,“Who done it?,327
1255,"We’ve heard considerable about these goings on down inHookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas that killed Huck Finn.”",327
1256,"“Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people _here_ that’dlike to know who killed him.",328
1257,Some think old Finn done it himself.”,328
1258,“No—is that so?”,329
1259,“Most everybody thought it at first.,330
1260,He’ll never know how nigh he cometo getting lynched.,330
1261,But before night they changed around and judged itwas done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”,330
1262,“Why _he_—”,331
1263,I stopped.,332
1264,I reckoned I better keep still.,332
1265,"She run on, and nevernoticed I had put in at all:",332
1266,“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed.,333
1267,So there’s areward out for him—three hundred dollars.,333
1268,"And there’s a reward out forold Finn, too—two hundred dollars.",333
1269,"You see, he come to town the morningafter the murder, and told about it, and was out with ’em on theferry-boat hunt, and right away after he up and left.",333
1270,"Before night theywanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.",333
1271,"Well, next day theyfound out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen senceten o’clock the night the murder was done.",333
1272,"So then they put it on him,you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn,and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for thenigger all over Illinois with.",333
1273,"The judge gave him some, and thatevening he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a coupleof mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.",333
1274,"Well, hehain’t come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till thisthing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boyand fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’dget Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.",333
1275,People do say he warn’t any too good to do it.,333
1276,"Oh, he’s sly, I reckon.",333
1277,If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be all right.,333
1278,"You can’t proveanything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, andhe’ll walk in Huck’s money as easy as nothing.”",333
1279,"“Yes, I reckon so, ’m.",334
1280,I don’t see nothing in the way of it.,334
1281,Haseverybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”,334
1282,"“Oh, no, not everybody.",335
1283,A good many thinks he done it.,335
1284,"But they’ll getthe nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”",335
1285,"“Why, are they after him yet?”",336
1286,"“Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you!",337
1287,Does three hundred dollars layaround every day for people to pick up?,337
1288,Some folks think the niggerain’t far from here.,337
1289,I’m one of them—but I hain’t talked it around.,337
1290,"Afew days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door inthe log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes tothat island over yonder that they call Jackson’s Island.",337
1291,Don’t anybodylive there?,337
1292,says I.,337
1293,"No, nobody, says they.",337
1294,"I didn’t say any more, but Idone some thinking.",337
1295,"I was pretty near certain I’d seen smoke overthere, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so Isays to myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there; anyway,says I, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.",337
1296,"I hain’t seenany smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s gone, if it was him; buthusband’s going over to see—him and another man.",337
1297,"He was gone up theriver; but he got back to-day, and I told him as soon as he got heretwo hours ago.”",337
1298,I had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still.,338
1299,I had to do something with myhands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it.,338
1300,"My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it.",338
1301,"When the womanstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curiousand smiling a little.",338
1302,"I put down the needle and thread, and let on tobe interested—and I was, too—and says:",338
1303,“Three hundred dollars is a power of money.,339
1304,I wish my mother could getit.,339
1305,Is your husband going over there to-night?”,339
1306,"“Oh, yes.",340
1307,"He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get aboat and see if they could borrow another gun.",340
1308,They’ll go over aftermidnight.”,340
1309,“Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”,341
1310,“Yes.,342
1311,"And couldn’t the nigger see better, too?",342
1312,"After midnight he’lllikely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and huntup his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s got one.”",342
1313,“I didn’t think of that.”,343
1314,"The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bitcomfortable.",344
1315,"Pretty soon she says,",344
1316,"“What did you say your name was, honey?”",345
1317,“M—Mary Williams.”,346
1318,"Somehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so Ididn’t look up—seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort ofcornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.",347
1319,I wished thewoman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier Iwas.,347
1320,But now she says:,347
1321,"“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”",348
1322,"“Oh, yes’m, I did.",349
1323,Sarah Mary Williams.,349
1324,Sarah’s my first name.,349
1325,"Somecalls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”",349
1326,"“Oh, that’s the way of it?”",350
1327,“Yes’m.”,351
1328,"I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway.",352
1329,Icouldn’t look up yet.,352
1330,"Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poorthey had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned theplace, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.",353
1331,She was rightabout the rats.,353
1332,You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in thecorner every little while.,353
1333,"She said she had to have things handy tothrow at them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no peace.",353
1334,"She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was agood shot with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a day or two ago,and didn’t know whether she could throw true now.",353
1335,"But she watched for achance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, andsaid “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.",353
1336,Then she told me to try for the nextone.,353
1337,"I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but ofcourse I didn’t let on.",353
1338,"I got the thing, and the first rat that showedhis nose I let drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been atolerable sick rat.",353
1339,"She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned Iwould hive the next one.",353
1340,"She went and got the lump of lead and fetchedit back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to helpher with.",353
1341,"I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, andwent on talking about her and her husband’s matters.",353
1342,But she broke offto say:,353
1343,“Keep your eye on the rats.,354
1344,"You better have the lead in your lap,handy.”",354
1345,"So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clappedmy legs together on it and she went on talking.",355
1346,But only about aminute.,355
1347,"Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,and very pleasant, and says:",355
1348,"“Come, now, what’s your real name?”",356
1349,"“Wh—what, mum?”",357
1350,“What’s your real name?,358
1351,"Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?—or what is it?”",358
1352,"I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do.",359
1353,ButI says:,359
1354,"“Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum.",360
1355,"If I’m in theway here, I’ll—”",360
1356,"“No, you won’t.",361
1357,Set down and stay where you are.,361
1358,"I ain’t going to hurtyou, and I ain’t going to tell on you, nuther.",361
1359,"You just tell me yoursecret, and trust me.",361
1360,"I’ll keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you.",361
1361,So’ll my old man if you want him to.,361
1362,"You see, you’re a runaway’prentice, that’s all.",361
1363,It ain’t anything.,361
1364,There ain’t no harm in it.,361
1365,"You’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.",361
1366,"Bless you,child, I wouldn’t tell on you.",361
1367,"Tell me all about it now, that’s a goodboy.”",361
1368,"So I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and Iwould just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’tgo back on her promise.",362
1369,"Then I told her my father and mother was dead,and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirtymile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t stand itno longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took mychance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and cleared out,and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.",362
1370,"I traveled nights,and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carriedfrom home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.",362
1371,"I said I believedmy uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why Istruck out for this town of Goshen.",362
1372,"“Goshen, child?",363
1373,This ain’t Goshen.,363
1374,This is St. Petersburg.,363
1375,Goshen’s tenmile further up the river.,363
1376,Who told you this was Goshen?”,363
1377,"“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turninto the woods for my regular sleep.",364
1378,"He told me when the roads forked Imust take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”",364
1379,"“He was drunk, I reckon.",365
1380,He told you just exactly wrong.”,365
1381,"“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter now.",366
1382,I gotto be moving along.,366
1383,I’ll fetch Goshen before daylight.”,366
1384,“Hold on a minute.,367
1385,I’ll put you up a snack to eat.,367
1386,You might want it.”,367
1387,"So she put me up a snack, and says:",368
1388,"“Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up first?",369
1389,Answerup prompt now—don’t stop to study over it.,369
1390,Which end gets up first?”,369
1391,"“The hind end, mum.”",370
1392,"“Well, then, a horse?”",371
1393,"“The for’rard end, mum.”",372
1394,“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”,373
1395,“North side.”,374
1396,"“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats withtheir heads pointed the same direction?”",375
1397,"“The whole fifteen, mum.”",376
1398,"“Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country.",377
1399,I thought maybe youwas trying to hocus me again.,377
1400,"What’s your real name, now?”",377
1401,"“George Peters, mum.”",378
1402,"“Well, try to remember it, George.",379
1403,"Don’t forget and tell me it’sElexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s GeorgeElexander when I catch you.",379
1404,And don’t go about women in that oldcalico.,379
1405,"You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.",379
1406,"Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don’t hold thethread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still andpoke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most always does, but aman always does t’other way.",379
1407,"And when you throw at a rat or anything,hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head asawkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot.",379
1408,"Throwstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it toturn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm outto one side, like a boy.",379
1409,"And, mind you, when a girl tries to catchanything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t clap themtogether, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.",379
1410,"Why, Ispotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and Icontrived the other things just to make certain.",379
1411,"Now trot along to youruncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get intotrouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll dowhat I can to get you out of it.",379
1412,"Keep the river road all the way, andnext time you tramp take shoes and socks with you.",379
1413,"The river road’s arocky one, and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, Ireckon.”",379
1414,"I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracksand slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.",380
1415,"Ijumped in, and was off in a hurry.",380
1416,"I went up-stream far enough to makethe head of the island, and then started across.",380
1417,"I took off thesun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then.",380
1418,"When I was about themiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; thesound come faint over the water but clear—eleven.",380
1419,"When I struck thehead of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded,but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, andstarted a good fire there on a high and dry spot.",380
1420,"Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a halfbelow, as hard as I could go.",381
1421,"I landed, and slopped through the timberand up the ridge and into the cavern.",381
1422,"There Jim laid, sound asleep onthe ground.",381
1423,I roused him out and says:,381
1424,"“Git up and hump yourself, Jim!",382
1425,There ain’t a minute to lose.,382
1426,They’reafter us!”,382
1427,"Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way heworked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared.",383
1428,"Bythat time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she wasready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid.",383
1429,"We putout the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show acandle outside after that.",383
1430,"I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;but if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadowsain’t good to see by.",384
1431,"Then we got out the raft and slipped along downin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still—never saying aword.",384
1432,CHAPTER XII.,386
1433,"It must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island atlast, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.",387
1434,"If a boat was to comealong we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinoisshore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever thoughtto put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.",387
1435,Wewas in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.,387
1436,It warn’tgood judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.,387
1437,"If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire Ibuilt, and watched it all night for Jim to come.",388
1438,"Anyways, they stayedaway from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’tno fault of mine.",388
1439,I played it as low down on them as I could.,388
1440,"When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a tow-head in abig bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches withthe hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like therehad been a cave-in in the bank there.",389
1441,A tow-head is a sandbar that hascottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.,389
1442,"We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinoisside, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so wewarn’t afraid of anybody running across us.",390
1443,"We laid there all day, andwatched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, andup-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.",390
1444,"I told Jim allabout the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was asmart one, and if she was to start after us herself _she_ wouldn’t setdown and watch a camp fire—no, sir, she’d fetch a dog.",390
1445,"Well, then, Isaid, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch a dog?",390
1446,"Jim said he betshe did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and hebelieved they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost allthat time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a tow-head sixteen orseventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be in that sameold town again.",390
1447,So I said I didn’t care what was the reason they didn’tget us as long as they didn’t.,390
1448,"When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of thecottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing insight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built asnug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep thethings dry.",391
1449,"Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot ormore above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the trapswas out of reach of steamboat waves.",391
1450,Right in the middle of the wigwamwe made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a framearound it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on insloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.,391
1451,"Wemade an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might getbroke on a snag or something.",391
1452,"We fixed up a short forked stick to hangthe old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern wheneverwe see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over;but we wouldn’t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see wewas in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet,very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boatsdidn’t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.",391
1453,"This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a currentthat was making over four mile an hour.",392
1454,"We catched fish and talked, andwe took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.",392
1455,"It was kind ofsolemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs lookingup at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and itwarn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle.",392
1456,"Wehad mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happenedto us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.",392
1457,"Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.",393
1458,"Thefifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world litup.",393
1459,"In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirtythousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see thatwonderful spread of lights at two o’clock that still night.",393
1460,Therewarn’t a sound there; everybody was asleep.,393
1461,"Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at somelittle village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon orother stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’troosting comfortable, and took him along.",394
1462,"Pap always said, take achicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him yourselfyou can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t everforgot.",394
1463,"I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken himself, butthat is what he used to say, anyway.",394
1464,"Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed awatermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things ofthat kind.",395
1465,"Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things if youwas meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’tanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.",395
1466,Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partlyright; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three thingsfrom the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more—then he reckonedit wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others.,395
1467,"So we talked it over allone night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our mindswhether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,or what.",395
1468,"But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, andconcluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons.",395
1469,"We warn’t feeling justright before that, but it was all comfortable now.",395
1470,"I was glad the wayit come out, too, because crabapples ain’t ever good, and the p’simmonswouldn’t be ripe for two or three months yet.",395
1471,"We shot a water-fowl, now and, then that got up too early in the morningor didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening.",396
1472,"Take it all round, welived pretty high.",396
1473,"The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, witha power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solidsheet.",397
1474,We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.,397
1475,"When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.",397
1476,"By-and-by says I, “Hel-_lo_, Jim,looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.",397
1477,Wewas drifting straight down for her.,397
1478,The lightning showed her verydistinct.,397
1479,"She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck abovewater, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, anda chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back ofit, when the flashes come.",397
1480,"Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all somysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when Isee that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle ofthe river.",398
1481,"I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, andsee what there was there.",398
1482,So I says:,398
1483,"“Le’s land on her, Jim.”",399
1484,But Jim was dead against it at first.,400
1485,He says:,400
1486,“I doan’ want to go fool’n ’long er no wrack.,401
1487,"We’s doin’ blame’ well,en we better let blame’ well alone, as de good book says.",401
1488,Like as notdey’s a watchman on dat wrack.”,401
1489,"“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t nothing to watch butthe texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody’s going toresk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, whenit’s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?” Jimcouldn’t say nothing to that, so he didn’t try.",402
1490,"“And besides,” I says,“we might borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom.",402
1491,"Seegars, _I_ bet you—and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.",402
1492,"Steamboatcaptains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_don’t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.",402
1493,"Stick a candle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we give her arummaging.",402
1494,Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?,402
1495,"Notfor pie, he wouldn’t.",402
1496,He’d call it an adventure—that’s what he’d callit; and he’d land on that wreck if it was his last act.,402
1497,"And wouldn’t hethrow style into it?—wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing?",402
1498,"Why,you’d think it was Christopher C’lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.",402
1499,Iwish Tom Sawyer _was_ here.”,402
1500,"Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.",403
1501,"He said we mustn’t talk any morethan we could help, and then talk mighty low.",403
1502,"The lightning showed usthe wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, andmade fast there.",403
1503,The deck was high out here.,404
1504,"We went sneaking down the slope of it tolabboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with ourfeet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was sodark we couldn’t see no sign of them.",404
1505,"Pretty soon we struck the forwardend of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched usin front of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, awaydown through the texas-hall we see a light!",404
1506,and all in the same secondwe seem to hear low voices in yonder!,404
1507,"Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me tocome along.",405
1508,"I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; butjust then I heard a voice wail out and say:",405
1509,"“Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!”",406
1510,"Another voice said, pretty loud:",407
1511,"“It’s a lie, Jim Turner.",408
1512,You’ve acted this way before.,408
1513,"You always wantmore’n your share of the truck, and you’ve always got it, too, becauseyou’ve swore ’t if you didn’t you’d tell.",408
1514,But this time you’ve said itjest one time too many.,408
1515,"You’re the meanest, treacherousest hound inthis country.”",408
1516,By this time Jim was gone for the raft.,409
1517,"I was just a-biling withcuriosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now, andso I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going on here.",409
1518,"So Idropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft inthe dark till there warn’t but one stateroom betwixt me and thecross-hall of the texas.",409
1519,"Then in there I see a man stretched on thefloor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one ofthem had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.",409
1520,"This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s head on the floor, andsaying:",409
1521,“I’d _like_ to!,410
1522,"And I orter, too—a mean skunk!”",410
1523,"The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t, Bill;I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”",411
1524,And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh andsay:,412
1525,"“’Deed you _ain’t!_ You never said no truer thing ’n that, you betyou.” And once he said: “Hear him beg!",413
1526,and yit if we hadn’t got thebest of him and tied him he’d a killed us both.,413
1527,And what _for?_ Jistfor noth’n.,413
1528,Jist because we stood on our _rights_—that’s what for.,413
1529,"ButI lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner.",413
1530,"Put_up_ that pistol, Bill.”",413
1531,Bill says:,414
1532,"“I don’t want to, Jake Packard.",415
1533,I’m for killin’ him—and didn’t he killold Hatfield jist the same way—and don’t he deserve it?”,415
1534,"“But I don’t _want_ him killed, and I’ve got my reasons for it.”",416
1535,"“Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard!",417
1536,"I’ll never forgit youlong’s I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.",417
1537,"Packard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on anail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motionedBill to come.",418
1538,"I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but theboat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep fromgetting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upperside.",418
1539,"The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got tomy stateroom, he says:",418
1540,“Here—come in here.”,419
1541,"And in he come, and Bill after him.",420
1542,"But before they got in I was up inthe upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.",420
1543,"Then they stood there,with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.",420
1544,"I couldn’t seethem, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they’d been having.",420
1545,"I was glad I didn’t drink whisky; but it wouldn’t made much differenceanyway, because most of the time they couldn’t a treed me because Ididn’t breathe.",420
1546,I was too scared.,420
1547,"And, besides, a body _couldn’t_breathe and hear such talk.",420
1548,They talked low and earnest.,420
1549,Bill wanted tokill Turner.,420
1550,He says:,420
1551,"“He’s said he’ll tell, and he will.",421
1552,If we was to give both our sharesto him _now_ it wouldn’t make no difference after the row and the waywe’ve served him.,421
1553,"Shore’s you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; nowyou hear _me_.",421
1554,I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”,421
1555,"“So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.",422
1556,"“Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t.",423
1557,"Well, then, that’s allright.",423
1558,Le’s go and do it.”,423
1559,“Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit.,424
1560,You listen to me.,424
1561,"Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s _got_ to bedone.",424
1562,But what _I_ say is this: it ain’t good sense to go court’naround after a halter if you can git at what you’re up to in some waythat’s jist as good and at the same time don’t bring you into no resks.,424
1563,Ain’t that so?”,424
1564,“You bet it is.,425
1565,But how you goin’ to manage it this time?”,425
1566,"“Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather up whateverpickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore andhide the truck.",426
1567,Then we’ll wait.,426
1568,Now I say it ain’t a-goin’ to bemore’n two hours befo’ this wrack breaks up and washes off down theriver.,426
1569,See?,426
1570,"He’ll be drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for itbut his own self.",426
1571,I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’of him.,426
1572,"I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git aroun’it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals.",426
1573,Ain’t I right?”,426
1574,"“Yes, I reck’n you are.",427
1575,But s’pose she _don’t_ break up and wash off?”,427
1576,"“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can’t we?”",428
1577,"“All right, then; come along.”",429
1578,"So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambledforward.",430
1579,"It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarsewhisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of amoan, and I says:",430
1580,"“Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning; there’s agang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up their boat and sether drifting down the river so these fellows can’t get away from thewreck there’s one of ’em going to be in a bad fix.",431
1581,But if we find theirboat we can put _all_ of ’em in a bad fix—for the Sheriff ’ll get ’em.,431
1582,Quick—hurry!,431
1583,"I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard.",431
1584,"Youstart at the raft, and—”",431
1585,"“Oh, my lordy, lordy!",432
1586,_Raf’?_ Dey ain’ no raf’ no mo’; she done brokeloose en gone I—en here we is!”,432
1587,CHAPTER XIII.,434
1588,"Well, I catched my breath and most fainted.",435
1589,Shut up on a wreck withsuch a gang as that!,435
1590,But it warn’t no time to be sentimentering.,435
1591,We’d_got_ to find that boat now—had to have it for ourselves.,435
1592,"So we wenta-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,too—seemed a week before we got to the stern.",435
1593,No sign of a boat.,435
1594,"Jimsaid he didn’t believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’thardly any strength left, he said.",435
1595,"But I said, come on, if we get lefton this wreck we are in a fix, sure.",435
1596,So on we prowled again.,435
1597,"We struckfor the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled alongforwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for theedge of the skylight was in the water.",435
1598,"When we got pretty close to thecross-hall door, there was the skiff, sure enough!",435
1599,I could just barelysee her.,435
1600,I felt ever so thankful.,435
1601,"In another second I would a beenaboard of her, but just then the door opened.",435
1602,"One of the men stuck hishead out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone;but he jerked it in again, and says:",435
1603,"“Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”",436
1604,"He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself andset down.",437
1605,It was Packard.,437
1606,Then Bill _he_ come out and got in.,437
1607,"Packardsays, in a low voice:",437
1608,“All ready—shove off!”,438
1609,"I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak.",439
1610,But Billsays:,439
1611,“Hold on—’d you go through him?”,440
1612,“No.,441
1613,Didn’t you?”,441
1614,“No.,442
1615,So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”,442
1616,"“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”",443
1617,"“Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”",444
1618,“Maybe he won’t.,445
1619,But we got to have it anyway.,445
1620,Come along.”,445
1621,So they got out and went in.,446
1622,"The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a halfsecond I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me.",447
1623,"I out with myknife and cut the rope, and away we went!",447
1624,"We didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor hardlyeven breathe.",448
1625,"We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip ofthe paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we wasa hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, everylast sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.",448
1626,"When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lanternshow like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowedby that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning tounderstand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.",449
1627,"Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft.",450
1628,Now was thefirst time that I begun to worry about the men—I reckon I hadn’t hadtime to before.,450
1629,"I begun to think how dreadful it was, even formurderers, to be in such a fix.",450
1630,"I says to myself, there ain’t notelling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then howwould _I_ like it?",450
1631,So says I to Jim:,450
1632,"“The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or aboveit, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the skiff,and then I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to gofor that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hungwhen their time comes.”",451
1633,"But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,and this time worse than ever.",452
1634,"The rain poured down, and never a lightshowed; everybody in bed, I reckon.",452
1635,"We boomed along down the river,watching for lights and watching for our raft.",452
1636,"After a long time therain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,and by-and-by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and wemade for it.",452
1637,"It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again.",453
1638,"Weseen a light now away down to the right, on shore.",453
1639,So I said I would gofor it.,453
1640,The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stolethere on the wreck.,453
1641,"We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I toldJim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had goneabout two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oarsand shoved for the light.",453
1642,"As I got down towards it, three or four moreshowed—up on a hillside.",453
1643,It was a village.,453
1644,"I closed in above the shorelight, and laid on my oars and floated.",453
1645,"As I went by, I see it was alantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferry-boat.",453
1646,"I skimmedaround for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; andby-and-by I found him roosting on the bitts, forward, with his headdown between his knees.",453
1647,"I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves,and begun to cry.",453
1648,"He stirred up, in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was onlyme, he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:",454
1649,"“Hello, what’s up?",455
1650,"Don’t cry, bub.",455
1651,What’s the trouble?”,455
1652,I says:,456
1653,"“Pap, and mam, and sis, and—”",457
1654,Then I broke down.,458
1655,He says:,458
1656,"“Oh, dang it now, _don’t_ take on so; we all has to have our troubles,and this’n ’ll come out all right.",459
1657,What’s the matter with ’em?”,459
1658,“They’re—they’re—are you the watchman of the boat?”,460
1659,"“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like.",461
1660,“I’m the captainand the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and headdeck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers.,461
1661,"I ain’t asrich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous and good toTom, Dick and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way hedoes; but I’ve told him a many a time ’t I wouldn’t trade places withhim; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life for me, and I’m derned if_I’d_ live two mile out o’ town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it.",461
1662,Says I—”,461
1663,I broke in and says:,462
1664,"“They’re in an awful peck of trouble, and—”",463
1665,“_Who_ is?”,464
1666,"“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you’d take yourferry-boat and go up there—”",465
1667,“Up where?,466
1668,Where are they?”,466
1669,“On the wreck.”,467
1670,“What wreck?”,468
1671,"“Why, there ain’t but one.”",469
1672,"“What, you don’t mean the _Walter Scott?_”",470
1673,“Yes.”,471
1674,“Good land!,472
1675,"what are they doin’ _there_, for gracious sakes?”",472
1676,"“Well, they didn’t go there a-purpose.”",473
1677,“I bet they didn’t!,474
1678,"Why, great goodness, there ain’t no chance for ’emif they don’t git off mighty quick!",474
1679,"Why, how in the nation did theyever git into such a scrape?”",474
1680,“Easy enough.,475
1681,Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—”,475
1682,"“Yes, Booth’s Landing—go on.”",476
1683,"“She was a-visiting there at Booth’s Landing, and just in the edge ofthe evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferryto stay all night at her friend’s house, Miss What-you-may-call-her Idisremember her name—and they lost their steering-oar, and swung aroundand went a-floating down, stern first, about two mile, andsaddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman andthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboardthe wreck.",477
1684,"Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in ourtrading-scow, and it was so dark we didn’t notice the wreck till we wasright on it; and so _we_ saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved butBill Whipple—and oh, he _was_ the best cretur!—I most wish’t it hadbeen me, I do.”",477
1685,“My George!,478
1686,It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck.,478
1687,And _then_ what didyou all do?”,478
1688,"“Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we couldn’t makenobody hear.",479
1689,So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get helpsomehow.,479
1690,"I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it,and Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help sooner, come here andhunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing.",479
1691,"I made the land about a milebelow, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to dosomething, but they said, ‘What, in such a night and such a current?",479
1692,There ain’t no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.’ Now if you’ll goand—”,479
1693,"“By Jackson, I’d _like_ to, and, blame it, I don’t know but I will; butwho in the dingnation’s a-going’ to _pay_ for it?",480
1694,Do you reckon yourpap—”,480
1695,“Why _that’s_ all right.,481
1696,"Miss Hooker she tole me, _particular_, thather uncle Hornback—”",481
1697,“Great guns!,482
1698,is _he_ her uncle?,482
1699,"Looky here, you break for that lightover yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about aquarter of a mile out you’ll come to the tavern; tell ’em to dart youout to Jim Hornback’s, and he’ll foot the bill.",482
1700,"And don’t you foolaround any, because he’ll want to know the news.",482
1701,Tell him I’ll have hisniece all safe before he can get to town.,482
1702,"Hump yourself, now; I’ma-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”",482
1703,"I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went backand got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore inthe easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among somewoodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferry-boatstart.",483
1704,"But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable onaccounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would adone it.",483
1705,I wished the widow knowed about it.,483
1706,"I judged she would beproud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions anddead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the mostinterest in.",483
1707,"Well, before long, here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding alongdown!",484
1708,"A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out forher.",484
1709,"She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much chancefor anybody being alive in her.",484
1710,"I pulled all around her and hollered alittle, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still.",484
1711,"I felt a littlebit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if theycould stand it, I could.",484
1712,"Then here comes the ferry-boat; so I shoved for the middle of the riveron a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach, Ilaid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around thewreck for Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know heruncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferry-boat giveit up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and wenta-booming down the river.",485
1713,"It did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and whenit did show, it looked like it was a thousand mile off.",486
1714,"By the time Igot there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so westruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turnedin and slept like dead people.",486
1715,CHAPTER XIV.,488
1716,"By-and-by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stoleoff of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and allsorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and threeboxes of seegars.",489
1717,We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither ofour lives.,489
1718,The seegars was prime.,489
1719,"We laid off all the afternoon in thewoods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general goodtime.",489
1720,"I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at theferry-boat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he saidhe didn’t want no more adventures.",489
1721,"He said that when I went in thetexas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone, henearly died; because he judged it was all up with _him_, anyway it couldbe fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get drownded; and if hedid get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to getthe reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure.",489
1722,"Well, hewas right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, fora nigger.",489
1723,"I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such,and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and calledeach other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on,’stead of mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.",490

1733,They just set around.”,494
1734,“No; is dat so?”,495
1735,“Of course it is.,496

1737,But other times they just lazy around; orgo hawking—just hawking and sp— Sh!—d’ you hear a noise?”,496
1738,"We skipped out and looked; but it warn’t nothing but the flutter of asteamboat’s wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.",497
1739,"“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull, they fuss withthe parlyment; and if everybody don’t go just so he whacks their headsoff.",498
1740,But mostly they hang round the harem.”,498

1848,CHAPTER XV.,548
1849,"We judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottomof Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we wasafter.",549
1850,"We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up theOhio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.",549
1851,"Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for atow-head to tie to, for it wouldn’t do to try to run in a fog; but whenI paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn’tanything but little saplings to tie to.",550
1852,"I passed the line around one ofthem right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current,and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the rootsand away she went.",550
1853,"I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sickand scared I couldn’t budge for most a half a minute it seemed tome—and then there warn’t no raft in sight; you couldn’t see twentyyards.",550
1854,"I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbedthe paddle and set her back a stroke.",550
1855,But she didn’t come.,550
1856,I was insuch a hurry I hadn’t untied her.,550
1857,"I got up and tried to untie her, butI was so excited my hands shook so I couldn’t hardly do anything withthem.",550
1858,"As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy,right down the tow-head.",551
1859,"That was all right as far as it went, but thetow-head warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot ofit I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea whichway I was going than a dead man.",551
1860,"Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into the bank ora tow-head or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it’smighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such atime.",552
1861,I whooped and listened.,552
1862,"Away down there somewheres I hears asmall whoop, and up comes my spirits.",552
1863,"I went tearing after it,listening sharp to hear it again.",552
1864,"The next time it come, I see I warn’theading for it, but heading away to the right of it.",552
1865,"And the next timeI was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either,for I was flying around, this way and that and t’other, but it wasgoing straight ahead all the time.",552
1866,"I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all thetime, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoopsthat was making the trouble for me.",553
1867,"Well, I fought along, and directlyI hears the whoop _behind_ me.",553
1868,I was tangled good now.,553
1869,"That wassomebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.",553
1870,I throwed the paddle down.,554
1871,"I heard the whoop again; it was behind meyet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing itsplace, and I kept answering, till by-and-by it was in front of meagain, and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream,and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsmanhollering.",554
1872,"I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothingdon’t look natural nor sound natural in a fog.",554
1873,"The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on acut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwedme off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairlyroared, the current was tearing by them so swift.",555
1874,In another second or two it was solid white and still again.,556
1875,"I setperfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon Ididn’t draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.",556
1876,I just give up then.,557
1877,I knowed what the matter was.,557
1878,"That cut bank was anisland, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it.",557
1879,It warn’t no tow-headthat you could float by in ten minutes.,557
1880,It had the big timber of aregular island; it might be five or six miles long and more than half amile wide.,557
1881,"I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon.",558
1882,"Iwas floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but youdon’t ever think of that.",558
1883,"No, you _feel_ like you are laying dead stillon the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’tthink to yourself how fast _you’re_ going, but you catch your breathand think, my!",558
1884,how that snag’s tearing along.,558
1885,"If you think it ain’tdismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, youtry it once—you’ll see.",558
1886,"Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hearsthe answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t doit, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of tow-heads, for I hadlittle dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrowchannel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was therebecause I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush andtrash that hung over the banks.",559
1887,"Well, I warn’t long loosing the whoopsdown amongst the tow-heads; and I only tried to chase them a littlewhile, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern.",559
1888,"Younever knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and somuch.",559
1889,"I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, tokeep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged theraft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it wouldget further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a littlefaster than what I was.",560
1890,"Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by-and-by, but I couldn’thear no sign of a whoop nowheres.",561
1891,"I reckoned Jim had fetched up on asnag, maybe, and it was all up with him.",561
1892,"I was good and tired, so Ilaid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more.",561
1893,"I didn’twant to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t help it;so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.",561
1894,"But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the starswas shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a bigbend stern first.",562
1895,First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I wasdreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to comeup dim out of last week.,562
1896,"It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickestkind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could seeby the stars.",563
1897,"I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on thewater.",563
1898,I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but acouple of sawlogs made fast together.,563
1899,"Then I see another speck, andchased that; then another, and this time I was right.",563
1900,It was the raft.,563
1901,"When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between hisknees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar.",564
1902,"Theother oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves andbranches and dirt.",564
1903,So she’d had a rough time.,564
1904,"I made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began togap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:",565
1905,"“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep?",566
1906,Why didn’t you stir me up?”,566
1907,"“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck?",567
1908,En you ain’ dead—you ain’drownded—you’s back agin?,567
1909,"It’s too good for true, honey, it’s too goodfor true.",567
1910,"Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o’ you.",567
1911,"No, you ain’dead!",567
1912,"you’s back agin, ’live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck—de same oleHuck, thanks to goodness!”",567
1913,"“What’s the matter with you, Jim?",568

1915,“Drinkin’?,569
1916,Has I ben a-drinkin’?,569
1917,Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin’?”,569
1918,"“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”",570
1919,“How does I talk wild?”,571
1920,"“_How?_ Why, hain’t you been talking about my coming back, and all thatstuff, as if I’d been gone away?”",572
1921,"“Huck—Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.",573
1922,_Hain’t_ youben gone away?”,573
1923,“Gone away?,574

1926,Where would I go to?”,574
1927,"“Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is.",575
1928,"Is I _me_, or who_is_ I?",575
1929,"Is I heah, or whah _is_ I?",575
1930,Now dat’s what I wants to know.”,575
1931,"“Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re atangle-headed old fool, Jim.”",576
1932,"“I is, is I?",577
1933,"Well, you answer me dis: Didn’t you tote out de line in decanoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head?”",577
1934,"“No, I didn’t.",578
1935,What tow-head?,578
1936,I hain’t see no tow-head.”,578
1937,“You hain’t seen no tow-head?,579

1940,"“Why, _de_ fog!—de fog dat’s been aroun’ all night.",581
1941,"En didn’t youwhoop, en didn’t I whoop, tell we got mix’ up in de islands en one unus got los’ en t’other one was jis’ as good as los’, ’kase he didn’know whah he wuz?",581

1943,"Now ain’ dat so, boss—ain’t itso?",581
1944,You answer me dat.”,581
1945,"“Well, this is too many for me, Jim.",582
1946,"I hain’t seen no fog, nor noislands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.",582
1947,"I been setting here talking withyou all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and Ireckon I done the same.",582
1948,"You couldn’t a got drunk in that time, so ofcourse you’ve been dreaming.”",582
1949,"“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”",583
1950,"“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any of ithappen.”",584
1951,"“But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as—”",585
1952,“It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t nothing init.,586
1953,"I know, because I’ve been here all the time.”",586
1954,"Jim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studyingover it.",587
1955,Then he says:,587
1956,"“Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain’tde powerfullest dream I ever see.",588
1957,En I hain’t ever had no dream b’fo’dat’s tired me like dis one.”,588
1958,"“Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body likeeverything sometimes.",589
1959,"But this one was a staving dream; tell me allabout it, Jim.”",589
1960,"So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just asit happened, only he painted it up considerable.",590
1961,"Then he said he muststart in and “’terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning.",590
1962,"He saidthe first tow-head stood for a man that would try to do us some good,but the current was another man that would get us away from him.",590
1963,"Thewhoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if wedidn’t try hard to make out to understand them they’d just take us intobad luck, ’stead of keeping us out of it.",590
1964,"The lot of tow-heads wastroubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kindsof mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn’t talk back andaggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and intothe big clear river, which was the free States, and wouldn’t have nomore trouble.",590
1965,"It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but itwas clearing up again now.",591
1966,"“Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,”I says; “but what does _these_ things stand for?”",592
1967,It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar.,593
1968,Youcould see them first-rate now.,593
1969,"Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trashagain.",594
1970,He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that hecouldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its placeagain right away.,594
1971,"But when he did get the thing straightened around helooked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:",594
1972,“What do dey stan’ for?,595
1973,I’se gwyne to tell you.,595
1974,"When I got all wore outwid work, en wid de callin’ for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuzmos’ broke bekase you wuz los’, en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become erme en de raf’.",595

1979,But that was enough.,596
1980,It made me feel so meanI could almost kissed _his_ foot to get him to take it back.,596
1981,"It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humblemyself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for itafterwards, neither.",597
1982,"I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and Iwouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him feel that way.",597
1983,CHAPTER XVI.,599
1984,"We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind amonstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession.",600
1985,"She hadfour long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many asthirty men, likely.",600
1986,"She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and anopen camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.",600
1987,Therewas a power of style about her.,600
1988,It _amounted_ to something being araftsman on such a craft as that.,600
1989,"We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and gothot.",601
1990,"The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on bothsides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.",601
1991,"Wetalked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we gotto it.",601
1992,"I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say there warn’tbut about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t happen to have themlit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?",601
1993,"Jim said if thetwo big rivers joined together there, that would show.",601
1994,But I said maybewe might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into thesame old river again.,601
1995,That disturbed Jim—and me too.,601
1996,"So the questionwas, what to do?",601
1997,"I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and wasa green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was toCairo.",601
1998,"Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it andwaited.",601
1999,"There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, andnot pass it without seeing it.",602
2000,"He said he’d be mighty sure to see it,because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed ithe’d be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom.",602
2001,Everylittle while he jumps up and says:,602
2002,“Dah she is?”,603
2003,But it warn’t.,604
2004,"It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he setdown again, and went to watching, same as before.",604
2005,Jim said it made himall over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.,604
2006,"Well, I cantell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free—andwho was to blame for it?",604
2007,"Why, _me_.",604
2008,"I couldn’t get that out of myconscience, no how nor no way.",604
2009,It got to troubling me so I couldn’trest; I couldn’t stay still in one place.,604
2010,"It hadn’t ever come home tome before, what this thing was that I was doing.",604
2011,"But now it did; and itstayed with me, and scorched me more and more.",604
2012,"I tried to make out tomyself that _I_ warn’t to blame, because _I_ didn’t run Jim off fromhis rightful owner; but it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, everytime, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could apaddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get aroundthat noway.",604
2013,That was where it pinched.,604
2014,"Conscience says to me, “What hadpoor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off rightunder your eyes and never say one single word?",604
2015,What did that poor oldwoman do to you that you could treat her so mean?,604
2016,"Why, she tried tolearn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried tobe good to you every way she knowed how.",604
2017,_That’s_ what she done.”,604
2018,I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead.,605
2019,"Ifidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim wasfidgeting up and down past me.",605
2020,We neither of us could keep still.,605
2021,"Everytime he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!” it went through me likea shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die ofmiserableness.",605
2022,Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself.,606
2023,"He wassaying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State hewould go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when hegot enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close towhere Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the twochildren, and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get anAb’litionist to go and steal them.",606
2024,It most froze me to hear such talk.,607
2025,He wouldn’t ever dared to talk suchtalk in his life before.,607
2026,Just see what a difference it made in him theminute he judged he was about free.,607
2027,"It was according to the old saying,“Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is whatcomes of my not thinking.",607
2028,"Here was this nigger, which I had as good ashelped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he wouldsteal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn’t even know;a man that hadn’t ever done me no harm.",607
2029,"I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him.",608
2030,"Myconscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I saysto it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll paddle ashore at thefirst light and tell.” I felt easy and happy and light as a featherright off.",608
2031,All my troubles was gone.,608
2032,"I went to looking out sharp for alight, and sort of singing to myself.",608
2033,By-and-by one showed.,608
2034,Jim singsout:,608
2035,"“We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe!",609
2036,Jump up and crack yo’ heels!,609
2037,"Dat’s de goodole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”",609
2038,I says:,610
2039,"“I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim.",611
2040,"It mightn’t be, you know.”",611
2041,"He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottomfor me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:",612
2042,"“Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll say, it’s all onaccounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I couldn’t ever ben free ef ithadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it.",613
2043,"Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck;you’s de bes’ fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de _only_ fren’ ole Jim’sgot now.”",613
2044,"I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he saysthis, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me.",614
2045,"I went alongslow then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I startedor whether I warn’t.",614
2046,"When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:",614
2047,"“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat ever kep’his promise to ole Jim.”",615
2048,"Well, I just felt sick.",616
2049,"But I says, I _got_ to do it—I can’t get _out_of it.",616
2050,"Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, andthey stopped and I stopped.",616
2051,One of them says:,616
2052,“What’s that yonder?”,617
2053,"“A piece of a raft,” I says.",618
2054,“Do you belong on it?”,619
2055,"“Yes, sir.”",620
2056,“Any men on it?”,621
2057,"“Only one, sir.”",622
2058,"“Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the headof the bend.",623
2059,Is your man white or black?”,623
2060,I didn’t answer up prompt.,624
2061,"I tried to, but the words wouldn’t come.",624
2062,"Itried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t manenough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit.",624
2063,"I see I was weakening; so I justgive up trying, and up and says:",624
2064,“He’s white.”,625
2065,“I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”,626
2066,"“I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s there, and maybeyou’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light is.",627
2067,He’s sick—and sois mam and Mary Ann.”,627
2068,"“Oh, the devil!",628
2069,"we’re in a hurry, boy.",628
2070,But I s’pose we’ve got to.,628
2071,"Come,buckle to your paddle, and let’s get along.”",628
2072,I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.,629
2073,"When we had made astroke or two, I says:",629
2074,"“Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you.",630
2075,"Everybody goesaway when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t do itby myself.”",630
2076,"“Well, that’s infernal mean.",631
2077,"Odd, too.",631
2078,"Say, boy, what’s the matter withyour father?”",631
2079,"“It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t anything much.”",632
2080,They stopped pulling.,633
2081,It warn’t but a mighty little ways to the raftnow.,633
2082,One says:,633
2083,"“Boy, that’s a lie.",634
2084,What _is_ the matter with your pap?,634
2085,"Answer upsquare now, and it’ll be the better for you.”",634
2086,"“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please.",635
2087,"It’sthe—the—gentlemen, if you’ll only pull ahead, and let me heave you theheadline, you won’t have to come a-near the raft—please do.”",635
2088,"“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one.",636
2089,They backed water.,636
2090,"“Keepaway, boy—keep to looard.",636
2091,"Confound it, I just expect the wind hasblowed it to us.",636
2092,"Your pap’s got the small-pox, and you know it preciouswell.",636
2093,Why didn’t you come out and say so?,636
2094,Do you want to spread it allover?”,636
2095,"“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody before, and theyjust went away and left us.”",637
2096,"“Poor devil, there’s something in that.",638
2097,"We are right down sorry foryou, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the small-pox, you see.",638
2098,"Lookhere, I’ll tell you what to do.",638
2099,"Don’t you try to land by yourself, oryou’ll smash everything to pieces.",638
2100,"You float along down about twentymiles, and you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.",638
2101,"Itwill be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell themyour folks are all down with chills and fever.",638
2102,"Don’t be a fool again,and let people guess what is the matter.",638
2103,"Now we’re trying to do you akindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s a good boy.",638
2104,It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the light is—it’s only awood-yard.,638
2105,"Say, I reckon your father’s poor, and I’m bound to say he’sin pretty hard luck.",638
2106,"Here, I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on thisboard, and you get it when it floats by.",638
2107,I feel mighty mean to leaveyou; but my kingdom!,638
2108,"it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t yousee?”",638
2109,"“Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a twenty to put on theboard for me.",639
2110,"Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you’llbe all right.”",639
2111,"“That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye.",640
2112,"If you see any runaway niggersyou get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”",640
2113,"“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway niggers get by me if Ican help it.”",641
2114,"They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because Iknowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me totry to learn to do right; a body that don’t get _started_ right whenhe’s little ain’t got no show—when the pinch comes there ain’t nothingto back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.",642
2115,"Then Ithought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s’pose you’d a doneright and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now?",642
2116,"No,says I, I’d feel bad—I’d feel just the same way I do now.",642
2117,"Well, then,says I, what’s the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesometo do right and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just thesame?",642
2118,I was stuck.,642
2119,I couldn’t answer that.,642
2120,"So I reckoned I wouldn’tbother no more about it, but after this always do whichever comehandiest at the time.",642
2121,I went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there.,643
2122,I looked all around; hewarn’t anywhere.,643
2123,I says:,643
2124,“Jim!”,644
2125,"“Here I is, Huck.",645
2126,Is dey out o’ sight yit?,645
2127,Don’t talk loud.”,645
2128,"He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out.",646
2129,"I toldhim they were out of sight, so he come aboard.",646
2130,He says:,646
2131,"“I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en wasgwyne to shove for sho’ if dey come aboard.",647
2132,Den I was gwyne to swim tode raf’ agin when dey was gone.,647
2133,"But lawsy, how you did fool ’em, Huck!",647
2134,Dat _wuz_ de smartes’ dodge!,647
2135,"I tell you, chile, I ’speck it save’ oleJim—ole Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”",647
2136,Then we talked about the money.,648
2137,It was a pretty good raise—twentydollars apiece.,648
2138,"Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now,and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the freeStates.",648
2139,"He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but hewished we was already there.",648
2140,"Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hidingthe raft good.",649
2141,"Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, andgetting all ready to quit rafting.",649
2142,That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away downin a left-hand bend.,650
2143,I went off in the canoe to ask about it.,651
2144,"Pretty soon I found a man outin the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line.",651
2145,I ranged up and says:,651
2146,"“Mister, is that town Cairo?”",652
2147,“Cairo?,653
2148,no.,653
2149,You must be a blame’ fool.”,653
2150,"“What town is it, mister?”",654
2151,"“If you want to know, go and find out.",655
2152,If you stay here botherin’around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll get something youwon’t want.”,655
2153,I paddled to the raft.,656
2154,"Jim was awful disappointed, but I said nevermind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.",656
2155,"We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; butit was high ground, so I didn’t go.",657
2156,"No high ground about Cairo, Jimsaid.",657
2157,I had forgot it.,657
2158,We laid up for the day on a tow-head tolerableclose to the left-hand bank.,657
2159,I begun to suspicion something.,657
2160,So didJim.,657
2161,I says:,657
2162,“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”,658
2163,He says:,659
2164,"“Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck.",660
2165,Po’ niggers can’t have no luck.,660
2166,Iawluz ’spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”,660
2167,"“I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim—I do wish I’d never laideyes on it.”",661
2168,"“It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know.",662
2169,Don’t you blame yo’self’bout it.”,662
2170,"When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sureenough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!",663
2171,So it was all up withCairo.,663
2172,We talked it all over.,664
2173,"It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we couldn’ttake the raft up the stream, of course.",664
2174,"There warn’t no way but to waitfor dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.",664
2175,"So we sleptall day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work,and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!",664
2176,We didn’t say a word for a good while.,665
2177,There warn’t anything to say.,665
2178,Weboth knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin;so what was the use to talk about it?,665
2179,"It would only look like we wasfinding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck—and keepon fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.",665
2180,"By-and-by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t noway but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buya canoe to go back in.",666
2181,"We warn’t going to borrow it when there warn’tanybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people afterus.",666
2182,So we shoved out after dark on the raft.,667
2183,"Anybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle asnake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe itnow if they read on and see what more it done for us.",668
2184,The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.,669
2185,But wedidn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours andmore.,669
2186,"Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the nextmeanest thing to fog.",669
2187,"You can’t tell the shape of the river, and youcan’t see no distance.",669
2188,"It got to be very late and still, and then alongcomes a steamboat up the river.",669
2189,"We lit the lantern, and judged shewould see it.",669
2190,Up-stream boats didn’t generly come close to us; they goout and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; butnights like this they bull right up the channel against the wholeriver.,669
2191,"We could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till shewas close.",670
2192,She aimed right for us.,670
2193,"Often they do that and try to seehow close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites offa sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinkshe’s mighty smart.",670
2194,"Well, here she comes, and we said she was going totry and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be sheering off a bit.",670
2195,"She wasa big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a blackcloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulgedout, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shininglike red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging rightover us.",670
2196,"There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop theengines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam—and as Jim wentoverboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straightthrough the raft.",670
2197,"I dived—and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheelhad got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.",671
2198,I couldalways stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under aminute and a half.,671
2199,"Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I wasnearly busting.",671
2200,"I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out ofmy nose, and puffed a bit.",671
2201,"Of course there was a booming current; andof course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after shestopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she waschurning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, thoughI could hear her.",671
2202,"I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer; soI grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” andstruck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.",672
2203,"But I made out to seethat the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, whichmeant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.",672
2204,"It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a goodlong time in getting over.",673
2205,"I made a safe landing, and clumb up thebank.",673
2206,"I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along overrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across abig old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.",673
2207,"I was going torush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howlingand barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.",673
2208,CHAPTER XVII.,675
2209,"In about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting hishead out, and says:",676
2210,"“Be done, boys!",677
2211,Who’s there?”,677
2212,I says:,678
2213,“It’s me.”,679
2214,“Who’s me?”,680
2215,"“George Jackson, sir.”",681
2216,“What do you want?”,682
2217,"“I don’t want nothing, sir.",683
2218,"I only want to go along by, but the dogswon’t let me.”",683
2219,“What are you prowling around here this time of night for—hey?”,684
2220,"“I warn’t prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”",685
2221,"“Oh, you did, did you?",686
2222,"Strike a light there, somebody.",686
2223,What did you sayyour name was?”,686
2224,"“George Jackson, sir.",687
2225,I’m only a boy.”,687
2226,"“Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be afraid—nobody’llhurt you.",688
2227,But don’t try to budge; stand right where you are.,688
2228,"Rouse outBob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns.",688
2229,"George Jackson, is thereanybody with you?”",688
2230,"“No, sir, nobody.”",689
2231,"I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.",690
2232,The man sung out:,690
2233,"“Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool—ain’t you got any sense?",691
2234,Put it on the floor behind the front door.,691
2235,"Bob, if you and Tom areready, take your places.”",691
2236,“All ready.”,692
2237,"“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”",693
2238,"“No, sir; I never heard of them.”",694
2239,"“Well, that may be so, and it mayn’t.",695
2240,"Now, all ready.",695
2241,"Step forward,George Jackson.",695
2242,"And mind, don’t you hurry—come mighty slow.",695
2243,"If there’sanybody with you, let him keep back—if he shows himself he’ll be shot.",695
2244,Come along now.,695
2245,"Come slow; push the door open yourself—just enough tosqueeze in, d’ you hear?”",695
2246,I didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to.,696
2247,"I took one slow step ata time and there warn’t a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart.",696
2248,"The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behindme.",696
2249,When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking andunbarring and unbolting.,696
2250,"I put my hand on the door and pushed it alittle and a little more till somebody said, “There, that’s enough—putyour head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.",696
2251,"The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, andme at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with gunspointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray andabout sixty, the other two thirty or more—all of them fine andhandsome—and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her twoyoung women which I couldn’t see right well.",697
2252,The old gentleman says:,697
2253,“There; I reckon it’s all right.,698
2254,Come in.”,698
2255,"As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred itand bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, andthey all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor,and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the frontwindows—there warn’t none on the side.",699
2256,"They held the candle, and took agood look at me, and all said, “Why, _he_ ain’t a Shepherdson—no, thereain’t any Shepherdson about him.” Then the old man said he hoped Iwouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he didn’t mean no harmby it—it was only to make sure.",699
2257,"So he didn’t pry into my pockets, butonly felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right.",699
2258,"He told meto make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the oldlady says:",699
2259,"“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be; and don’tyou reckon it may be he’s hungry?”",700
2260,"“True for you, Rachel—I forgot.”",701
2261,So the old lady says:,702
2262,"“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and get himsomething to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girlsgo and wake up Buck and tell him—oh, here he is himself.",703
2263,"Buck, takethis little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress himup in some of yours that’s dry.”",703
2264,"Buck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there,though he was a little bigger than me.",704
2265,"He hadn’t on anything but ashirt, and he was very frowzy-headed.",704
2266,"He came in gaping and digging onefist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one.",704
2267,He says:,704
2268,“Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”,705
2269,"They said, no, ’twas a false alarm.",706
2270,"“Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d a got one.”",707
2271,"They all laughed, and Bob says:",708
2272,"“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so slow incoming.”",709
2273,"“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m always kept down; Idon’t get no show.”",710
2274,"“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll have show enough,all in good time, don’t you fret about that.",711
2275,"Go ’long with you now, anddo as your mother told you.”",711

2278,"I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it before, no way.",712
2279,"“Well, guess,” he says.",713
2280,"“How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never heard tell of itbefore?”",714
2281,"“But you can guess, can’t you?",715
2282,It’s just as easy.”,715
2283,“_Which_ candle?” I says.,716
2284,"“Why, any candle,” he says.",717
2285,"“I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was he?”",718
2286,"“Why, he was in the _dark!_ That’s where he was!”",719
2287,"“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”",720
2288,"“Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see?",721
2289,"Say, how long are yougoing to stay here?",721
2290,You got to stay always.,721
2291,We can just have boomingtimes—they don’t have no school now.,721
2292,Do you own a dog?,721
2293,I’ve got adog—and he’ll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in.,721
2294,"Doyou like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness?",721
2295,"You betI don’t, but ma she makes me.",721
2296,Confound these ole britches!,721

2299,All right.,721
2300,"Come along, old hoss.”",721
2301,"Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that is what theyhad for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever I’vecome across yet.",722
2302,"Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes,except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women.",722
2303,"Theyall smoked and talked, and I eat and talked.",722
2304,"The young women had quiltsaround them, and their hair down their backs.",722
2305,"They all asked mequestions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was livingon a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Annrun off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill wentto hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, andthen there warn’t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was justtrimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died Itook what there was left, because the farm didn’t belong to us, andstarted up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that washow I come to be here.",722
2306,So they said I could have a home there as longas I wanted it.,722
2307,"Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed,and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, dratit all, I had forgot what my name was.",722
2308,"So I laid there about an hourtrying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:",722
2309,"“Can you spell, Buck?”",723
2310,"“Yes,” he says.",724
2311,"“I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.",725
2312,"“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.",726
2313,"“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”",727
2314,"“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—there now,” he says.",728
2315,"“Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think you could.",729
2316,It ain’t noslouch of a name to spell—right off without studying.”,729
2317,"I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell itnext, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I wasused to it.",730
2318,"It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too.",731
2319,I hadn’tseen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had somuch style.,731
2320,"It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor awooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the sameas houses in town.",731
2321,"There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of abed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them.",731
2322,"There was a bigfireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept cleanand red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick;sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they callSpanish-brown, same as they do in town.",731
2323,They had big brass dog-ironsthat could hold up a saw-log.,731
2324,"There was a clock on the middle of themantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of theglass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and youcould see the pendulum swinging behind it.",731
2325,"It was beautiful to hearthat clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had beenalong and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start inand strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out.",731
2326,Theywouldn’t took any money for her.,731
2327,"Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, madeout of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy.",732
2328,"By one of theparrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open theirmouths nor look different nor interested.",732
2329,They squeaked throughunderneath.,732
2330,There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread outbehind those things.,732
2331,"On the table in the middle of the room was a kindof a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches andgrapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettierthan real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see wherepieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever itwas, underneath.",732
2332,"This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red andblue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around.",733
2333,"Itcome all the way from Philadelphia, they said.",733
2334,"There was some books,too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.",733
2335,One was abig family Bible full of pictures.,733
2336,"One was Pilgrim’s Progress, about aman that left his family, it didn’t say why.",733
2337,I read considerable in itnow and then.,733
2338,"The statements was interesting, but tough.",733
2339,"Another wasFriendship’s Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn’tread the poetry.",733
2340,"Another was Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr.Gunn’s Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a bodywas sick or dead.",733
2341,"There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.",733
2342,"Andthere was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not baggeddown in the middle and busted, like an old basket.",733
2343,"They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing theDeclaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of thedaughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteenyears old.",734
2344,"They was different from any pictures I ever seebefore—blacker, mostly, than is common.",734
2345,"One was a woman in a slim blackdress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage inthe middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with ablack veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, andvery wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive ona tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her otherhand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.”Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight tothe top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like achair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead birdlaying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneaththe picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at themoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter inone hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she wasmashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneaththe picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” Thesewas all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t somehow seem to take tothem, because if ever I was down a little they always give me thefan-tods.",734
2346,"Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lotmore of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had donewhat they had lost.",734
2347,But I reckoned that with her disposition she washaving a better time in the graveyard.,734
2348,"She was at work on what theysaid was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day andevery night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got itdone, but she never got the chance.",734
2349,"It was a picture of a young womanin a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready tojump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon,with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms foldedacross her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two morereaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair wouldlook best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I wassaying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they keptthis picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time herbirthday come they hung flowers on it.",734
2350,Other times it was hid with alittle curtain.,734
2351,"The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nicesweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery,seemed to me.",734
2352,"This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to pasteobituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out ofthe _Presbyterian Observer_, and write poetry after them out of her ownhead.",735
2353,It was very good poetry.,735
2354,This is what she wrote about a boy bythe name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and wasdrownded:,735
2355,"ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D",736
2356,"And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die?",737
2357,"And did the sad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?",737
2358,"No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;Though sad hearts round him thickened,    ’Twas not from sickness’ shots.",738
2359,"No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.",739
2360,"Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots,Nor stomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.",740
2361,O no.,741
2362,"Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell.",741
2363,His soul did from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.,741
2364,They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late;His spirit was gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.,742
2365,"If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she wasfourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by-and-by.",743
2366,Bucksaid she could rattle off poetry like nothing.,743
2367,She didn’t ever have tostop to think.,743
2368,"He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn’tfind anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap downanother one, and go ahead.",743
2369,She warn’t particular; she could write aboutanything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful.,743
2370,"Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would beon hand with her “tribute” before he was cold.",743
2371,She called themtributes.,743
2372,"The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline,then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline butonce, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person’s name,which was Whistler.",743
2373,"She warn’t ever the same after that; she nevercomplained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long.",743
2374,"Poorthing, many’s the time I made myself go up to the little room that usedto be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when herpictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little.",743
2375,"Iliked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn’t going to letanything come between us.",743
2376,"Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the deadpeople when she was alive, and it didn’t seem right that there warn’tnobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat outa verse or two myself, but I couldn’t seem to make it go somehow.",743
2377,"Theykept Emmeline’s room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it justthe way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody everslept there.",743
2378,"The old lady took care of the room herself, though therewas plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read herBible there mostly.",743
2379,"Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains onthe windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vinesall down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink.",744
2380,"There was a littleold piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was everso lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken”and play “The Battle of Prague” on it.",744
2381,"The walls of all the rooms wasplastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house waswhitewashed on the outside.",744
2382,"It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofedand floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of theday, and it was a cool, comfortable place.",745
2383,Nothing couldn’t be better.,745
2384,"And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!",745
2385,CHAPTER XVIII.,747
2386,"Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see.",748
2387,He was a gentleman all over;and so was his family.,748
2388,"He was well born, as the saying is, and that’sworth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said,and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in ourtown; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no more qualitythan a mudcat himself.",748
2389,"Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim,and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres;he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he hadthe thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and ahigh nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk sodeep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you,as you may say.",748
2390,"His forehead was high, and his hair was black andstraight and hung to his shoulders.",748
2391,"His hands was long and thin, andevery day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from headto foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; andon Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it.",748
2392,Hecarried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.,748
2393,"There warn’t nofrivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud.",748
2394,"He was askind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you hadconfidence.",748
2395,"Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when hestraightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun toflicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first,and find out what the matter was afterwards.",748
2396,He didn’t ever have totell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-manneredwhere he was.,748
2397,"Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshinemost always—I mean he made it seem like good weather.",748
2398,"When he turnedinto a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that wasenough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again for a week.",748
2399,"When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family gotup out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set downagain till they had set down.",749
2400,"Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboardwhere the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it tohim, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s wasmixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam;”and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and sothey drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water onthe sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of theirtumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old peopletoo.",749
2401,"Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broadshoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes.",750
2402,"Theydressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, andwore broad Panama hats.",750
2403,"Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proudand grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; butwhen she was, she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks,like her father.",751
2404,She was beautiful.,751
2405,"So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind.",752
2406,"She wasgentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.",752
2407,Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too.,753
2408,"My niggerhad a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having anybody doanything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the time.",753
2409,"This was all there was of the family now, but there used to bemore—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.",754
2410,The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.,755
2411,"Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten orfifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have suchjunketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in thewoods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.",755
2412,These people was mostlykinfolks of the family.,755
2413,The men brought their guns with them.,755
2414,"It was ahandsome lot of quality, I tell you.",755
2415,There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or sixfamilies—mostly of the name of Shepherdson.,756
2416,They was as high-toned andwell born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.,756
2417,"TheShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, whichwas about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up therewith a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons thereon their fine horses.",756
2418,"One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard ahorse coming.",757
2419,We was crossing the road.,757
2420,Buck says:,757
2421,“Quick!,758
2422,Jump for the woods!”,758
2423,"We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves.",759
2424,"Prettysoon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting hishorse easy and looking like a soldier.",759
2425,He had his gun across hispommel.,759
2426,I had seen him before.,759
2427,It was young Harney Shepherdson.,759
2428,"I heardBuck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled off from hishead.",759
2429,He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we washid.,759
2430,But we didn’t wait.,759
2431,We started through the woods on a run.,759
2432,"Thewoods warn’t thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet,and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode awaythe way he come—to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn’t see.",759
2433,We neverstopped running till we got home.,759
2434,"The old gentleman’s eyes blazed aminute—’twas pleasure, mainly, I judged—then his face sort of smootheddown, and he says, kind of gentle:",759
2435,“I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush.,760
2436,"Why didn’t you stepinto the road, my boy?”",760
2437,"“The Shepherdsons don’t, father.",761
2438,They always take advantage.”,761
2439,"Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was tellinghis tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped.",762
2440,"The two youngmen looked dark, but never said nothing.",762
2441,"Miss Sophia she turned pale,but the color come back when she found the man warn’t hurt.",762
2442,"Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees byourselves, I says:",763
2443,"“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”",764
2444,"“Well, I bet I did.”",765
2445,“What did he do to you?”,766
2446,“Him?,767
2447,He never done nothing to me.”,767
2448,"“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”",768
2449,"“Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.”",769
2450,“What’s a feud?”,770
2451,"“Why, where was you raised?",771
2452,Don’t you know what a feud is?”,771
2453,“Never heard of it before—tell me about it.”,772
2454,"“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way.",773
2455,"A man has a quarrel withanother man, and kills him; then that other man’s brother kills _him;_then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the_cousins_ chip in—and by-and-by everybody’s killed off, and there ain’tno more feud.",773
2456,"But it’s kind of slow, and takes a long time.”",773
2457,"“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”",774
2458,"“Well, I should _reckon!_ It started thirty year ago, or som’ers alongthere.",775
2459,"There was trouble ’bout something, and then a lawsuit to settleit; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot theman that won the suit—which he would naturally do, of course.",775
2460,Anybodywould.”,775
2461,"“What was the trouble about, Buck?—land?”",776
2462,“I reckon maybe—I don’t know.”,777
2463,"“Well, who done the shooting?",778
2464,Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”,778
2465,"“Laws, how do _I_ know?",779
2466,It was so long ago.”,779
2467,“Don’t anybody know?”,780
2468,"“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; butthey don’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”",781
2469,"“Has there been many killed, Buck?”",782
2470,“Yes; right smart chance of funerals.,783
2471,But they don’t always kill.,783
2472,"Pa’sgot a few buckshot in him; but he don’t mind it ’cuz he don’t weighmuch, anyway.",783
2473,"Bob’s been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s beenhurt once or twice.”",783
2474,"“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”",784
2475,“Yes; we got one and they got one.,785
2476,"’Bout three months ago my cousinBud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other side ofthe river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was blame’foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behindhim, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after him with his gun inhis hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and ’stead of jumpingoff and taking to the brush, Bud ’lowed he could out-run him; so theyhad it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more, the old man a-gaining allthe time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t any use, so he stopped andfaced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and theold man he rode up and shot him down.",785
2477,"But he didn’t git much chance toenjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid _him_ out.”",785
2478,"“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”",786
2479,“I reckon he _warn’t_ a coward.,787
2480,Not by a blame’ sight.,787
2481,There ain’t acoward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one.,787
2482,And there ain’t no cowardsamongst the Grangerfords either.,787
2483,"Why, that old man kep’ up his end in afight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come outwinner.",787
2484,"They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and gotbehind a little woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop thebullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered aroundthe old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them.",787
2485,"Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but theGrangerfords had to be _fetched_ home—and one of ’em was dead, andanother died the next day.",787
2486,"No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for cowardshe don’t want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuzthey don’t breed any of that _kind_.”",787
2487,"Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybodya-horseback.",788
2488,"The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept thembetween their knees or stood them handy against the wall.",788
2489,TheShepherdsons done the same.,788
2490,"It was pretty ornery preaching—all aboutbrotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was agood sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such apowerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace andpreforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to meto be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.",788
2491,"About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in theirchairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull.",789
2492,Buck anda dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep.,789
2493,"I went upto our room, and judged I would take a nap myself.",789
2494,"I found that sweetMiss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she tookme in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I likedher, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for herand not tell anybody, and I said I would.",789
2495,"Then she said she’d forgother Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two otherbooks, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, andnot say nothing to nobody.",789
2496,I said I would.,789
2497,"So I slid out and slippedoff up the road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except maybe ahog or two, for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs likes apuncheon floor in summer-time because it’s cool.",789
2498,"If you notice, mostfolks don’t go to church only when they’ve got to; but a hog isdifferent.",789
2499,"Says I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl to be insuch a sweat about a Testament.",790
2500,"So I give it a shake, and out drops alittle piece of paper with “_Half-past two_” wrote on it with a pencil.",790
2501,"I ransacked it, but couldn’t find anything else.",790
2502,"I couldn’t makeanything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when Igot home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.",790
2503,"She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testamenttill she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad;and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, andsaid I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.",790
2504,"She wasmighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and itmade her powerful pretty.",790
2505,"I was a good deal astonished, but when I gotmy breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if Ihad read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paperwarn’t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go andplay now.",790
2506,"I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soonI noticed that my nigger was following along behind.",791
2507,"When we was out ofsight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comesa-running, and says:",791
2508,"“Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show you a wholestack o’ water-moccasins.”",792
2509,"Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.",793
2510,He oughterknow a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting forthem.,793
2511,"What is he up to, anyway?",793
2512,So I says:,793
2513,“All right; trot ahead.”,794
2514,"I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and wadedankle deep as much as another half-mile.",795
2515,"We come to a little flat pieceof land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,and he says:",795
2516,"“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s whah deyis.",796
2517,I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer to see ’em no mo’.”,796
2518,"Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the treeshid him.",797
2519,"I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patchas big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man layingthere asleep—and, by jings, it was my old Jim!",797
2520,"I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise tohim to see me again, but it warn’t.",798
2521,"He nearly cried he was so glad, buthe warn’t surprised.",798
2522,"Said he swum along behind me that night, and heardme yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because he didn’t want nobody topick _him_ up and take him into slavery again.",798
2523,Says he:,798
2524,"“I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a considable waysbehine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned I could ketch upwid you on de lan’ ’dout havin’ to shout at you, but when I see dathouse I begin to go slow.",799

2529,"I ben a-buyin’ pots en pans en vittles, as I got achanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’ nights when—”",801
2530,"“_What_ raft, Jim?”",802
2531,“Our ole raf’.”,803
2532,“You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?”,804
2533,"“No, she warn’t.",805
2534,"She was tore up a good deal—one en’ of her was; butdey warn’t no great harm done, on’y our traps was mos’ all los’.",805

2537,"“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim—did you catch her?”",806
2538,“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?,807
2539,"No; some er de niggersfoun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en dey hid her in acrick ’mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin’ ’bout which un ’umshe b’long to de mos’ dat I come to heah ’bout it pooty soon, so I upsen settles de trouble by tellin’ ’um she don’t b’long to none uv um,but to you en me; en I ast ’m if dey gwyne to grab a young whitegenlman’s propaty, en git a hid’n for it?",807

2545,If anything happens _he_ ain’tmixed up in it.,808
2546,"He can say he never seen us together, and it’ll be thetruth.”",808
2547,I don’t want to talk much about the next day.,809
2548,I reckon I’ll cut itpretty short.,809
2549,"I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over andgo to sleep again, when I noticed how still it was—didn’t seem to beanybody stirring.",809
2550,That warn’t usual.,809
2551,Next I noticed that Buck was upand gone.,809
2552,"Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes down stairs—nobodyaround; everything as still as a mouse.",809
2553,Just the same outside.,809
2554,"ThinksI, what does it mean?",809
2555,"Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, andsays:",809
2556,“What’s it all about?”,810
2557,Says he:,811
2558,"“Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?”",812
2559,"“No,” says I, “I don’t.”",813
2560,"“Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off!",814
2561,’deed she has.,814

2565,"De women folks has gone for to stir up derelations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up deriver road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ he kingit acrost de river wid Miss Sophia.",814
2566,I reck’n dey’s gwyne to be mightyrough times.”,814
2567,“Buck went off ’thout waking me up.”,815
2568,"“Well, I reck’n he _did!_ Dey warn’t gwyne to mix you up in it.",816
2569,MarsBuck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s gwyne to fetch home aShepherdson or bust.,816
2570,"Well, dey’ll be plenty un ’m dah, I reck’n, en youbet you he’ll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”",816
2571,I took up the river road as hard as I could put.,817
2572,By-and-by I begin tohear guns a good ways off.,817
2573,"When I come in sight of the log store andthe woodpile where the steamboats lands, I worked along under the treesand brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into theforks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched.",817
2574,"There was awood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and firstI was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.",817
2575,"There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the openplace before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at acouple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of thesteamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it.",818
2576,Every time one of themshowed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.,818
2577,"Thetwo boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they couldwatch both ways.",818
2578,By-and-by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling.,819
2579,"They startedriding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steadybead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.",819
2580,Allthe men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and startedto carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on therun.,819
2581,They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed.,819
2582,"Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out afterthem.",819
2583,"They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys hadtoo good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of mytree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the menagain.",819
2584,"One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chapabout nineteen years old.",819
2585,"The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.",820
2586,As soon as they wasout of sight I sung out to Buck and told him.,820
2587,He didn’t know what tomake of my voice coming out of the tree at first.,820
2588,He was awfulsurprised.,820
2589,He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the mencome in sight again; said they was up to some devilment orother—wouldn’t be gone long.,820
2590,"I wished I was out of that tree, but Idasn’t come down.",820
2591,"Buck begun to cry and rip, and ’lowed that him andhis cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for thisday yet.",820
2592,"He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two orthree of the enemy.",820
2593,Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush.,820
2594,Bucksaid his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—theShepherdsons was too strong for them.,820
2595,I asked him what was become ofyoung Harney and Miss Sophia.,820
2596,He said they’d got across the river andwas safe.,820
2597,I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because hedidn’t manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t everheard anything like it.,820
2598,"All of a sudden, bang!",821
2599,bang!,821
2600,bang!,821
2601,goes three or four guns—the men hadslipped around through the woods and come in from behind without theirhorses!,821
2602,"The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as theyswum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them andsinging out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell outof the tree.",821
2603,I ain’t a-going to tell _all_ that happened—it would makeme sick again if I was to do that.,821
2604,I wished I hadn’t ever come ashorethat night to see such things.,821
2605,I ain’t ever going to get shut ofthem—lots of times I dream about them.,821
2606,"I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.",822
2607,Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen littlegangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned thetrouble was still a-going on.,822
2608,"I was mighty downhearted; so I made up mymind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned Iwas to blame, somehow.",822
2609,"I judged that that piece of paper meant thatMiss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off;and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and thecurious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, andthis awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.",822
2610,"When I got down out of the tree, I crept along down the river bank apiece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, andtugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces,and got away as quick as I could.",823
2611,"I cried a little when I was coveringup Buck’s face, for he was mighty good to me.",823
2612,It was just dark now.,824
2613,"I never went near the house, but struck throughthe woods and made for the swamp.",824
2614,"Jim warn’t on his island, so Itramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country.",824
2615,The raft wasgone!,824
2616,"My souls, but I was scared!",824
2617,I couldn’t get my breath for most aminute.,824
2618,Then I raised a yell.,824
2619,A voice not twenty-five foot from mesays:,824
2620,“Good lan’!,825
2621,"is dat you, honey?",825
2622,Doan’ make no noise.”,825
2623,It was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before.,826
2624,"I run along thebank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, hewas so glad to see me.",826
2625,He says:,826
2626,"“Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s dead agin.",827
2627,"Jack’sbeen heah; he say he reck’n you’s ben shot, kase you didn’ come home nomo’; so I’s jes’ dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf erde crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jackcomes agin en tells me for certain you _is_ dead.",827
2628,"Lawsy, I’s mightyglad to git you back agin, honey.”",827
2629,I says:,828
2630,"“All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me, and they’ll thinkI’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s something up therethat’ll help them think so—so don’t you lose no time, Jim, but justshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”",829
2631,I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in themiddle of the Mississippi.,830
2632,"Then we hung up our signal lantern, andjudged that we was free and safe once more.",830
2633,"I hadn’t had a bite to eatsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk,and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t nothing in the world sogood when it’s cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked, andhad a good time.",830
2634,"I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and sowas Jim to get away from the swamp.",830
2635,"We said there warn’t no home like araft, after all.",830
2636,"Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but araft don’t.",830
2637,You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.,830
2638,CHAPTER XIX.,832
2639,"Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swumby, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely.",833
2640,Here is the way weput in the time.,833
2641,"It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes amile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soonas night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly alwaysin the dead water under a tow-head; and then cut young cottonwoods andwillows, and hid the raft with them.",833
2642,Then we set out the lines.,833
2643,"Next weslid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off;then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about kneedeep, and watched the daylight come.",833
2644,"Not a sound anywheres—perfectlystill—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes thebullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe.",833
2645,"The first thing to see, looking awayover the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t’otherside; you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky;then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up awayoff, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little darkspots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such things;and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweepscreaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come sofar; and by-and-by you could see a streak on the water which you knowby the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a swift currentwhich breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see themist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river,and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bankon t’other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled bythem cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nicebreeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool andfresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; butsometimes not that way, because they’ve left dead fish laying around,gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got thefull day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds justgoing it!",833
2646,"A little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish offof the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.",834
2647,"And afterwards we would watchthe lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by-and-bylazy off to sleep.",834
2648,"Wake up by-and-by, and look to see what done it, andmaybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards theother side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only whether she was astern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn’t benothing to hear nor nothing to see—just solid lonesomeness.",834
2649,"Next you’dsee a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on itchopping, because they’re most always doing it on a raft; you’d see theaxe flash and come down—you don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go upagain, and by the time it’s above the man’s head then you hear the_k’chunk!_—it had took all that time to come over the water.",834
2650,"So wewould put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.",834
2651,"Oncethere was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by wasbeating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn’t run over them.",834
2652,A scow or araft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing andlaughing—heard them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it madeyou feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air.,834
2653,Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:,834
2654,"“No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”",835
2655,"Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about themiddle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wantedher to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, andtalked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night,whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s folks madefor me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t go much onclothes, nohow.",836
2656,Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the longesttime.,837
2657,"Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybea spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on thewater you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; andmaybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of themcrafts.",837
2658,It’s lovely to live on a raft.,837
2659,"We had the sky up there, allspeckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up atthem, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.",837
2660,"Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged itwould have took too long to _make_ so many.",837
2661,"Jim said the moon could a_laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn’t saynothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay most as many, so ofcourse it could be done.",837
2662,"We used to watch the stars that fell, too, andsee them streak down.",837
2663,Jim allowed they’d got spoiled and was hove outof the nest.,837
2664,"Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in thedark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up outof her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awfulpretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out andher powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by-and-by herwaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle theraft a bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’ttell how long, except maybe frogs or something.",838
2665,"After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two orthree hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows.",839
2666,"These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again meantmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away.",839
2667,"One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute tothe main shore—it was only two hundred yards—and paddled about a mileup a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get someberries.",840
2668,"Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpathcrossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path astight as they could foot it.",840
2669,"I thought I was a goner, for wheneveranybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_—or maybe Jim.",840
2670,"I wasabout to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to methen, and sung out and begged me to save their lives—said they hadn’tbeen doing nothing, and was being chased for it—said there was men anddogs a-coming.",840
2671,"They wanted to jump right in, but I says:",840
2672,“Don’t you do it.,841
2673,I don’t hear the dogs and horses yet; you’ve got timeto crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then youtake to the water and wade down to me and get in—that’ll throw the dogsoff the scent.”,841
2674,"They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our tow-head,and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men awayoff, shouting.",842
2675,"We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’tsee them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we gotfurther and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them atall; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck theriver, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the tow-head and hidin the cottonwoods and was safe.",842
2676,"One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald headand very gray whiskers.",843
2677,"He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and agreasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffedinto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses—no, he only had one.",843

2679,"The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery.",844
2680,"Afterbreakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come outwas that these chaps didn’t know one another.",844
2681,“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other chap.,845
2682,"“Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth—andit does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along with it—but Istayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the actof sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town,and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off.",846
2683,"So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out_with_ you.",846

2698,“What ’re you alassin’ about?” says the baldhead.,854
2699,"“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and bedegraded down into such company.” And he begun to wipe the corner ofhis eye with a rag.",855

2721,By rights I am a duke!”,863
2722,"Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too.",864

2727,The second son of the late duke seized thetitles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored.,865
2728,"I am the linealdescendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; andhere am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despisedby the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to thecompanionship of felons on a raft!”",865
2729,"Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I.",866
2730,"We tried to comfort him, buthe said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said if wewas a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than mostanything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.",866
2731,"He said weought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or “My Lord,”or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain“Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; andone of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing forhim he wanted done.",866
2732,"Well, that was all easy, so we done it.",867
2733,"All through dinner Jim stoodaround and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis orsome o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing tohim.",867
2734,"But the old man got pretty silent by-and-by—didn’t have much to say,and didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was goingon around that duke.",868
2735,He seemed to have something on his mind.,868
2736,"So, alongin the afternoon, he says:",868
2737,"“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry for you, but youain’t the only person that’s had troubles like that.”",869
2738,“No?”,870

2743,“Hold!,874
2744,What do you mean?”,874
2745,"“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.",875
2746,"“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,and says, “That secret of your being: speak!”",876
2747,"“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”",877
2748,"You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.",878
2749,Then the duke says:,878
2750,“You are what?”,879
2751,"“Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin’ at this verymoment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looythe Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”",880
2752,“You!,881
2753,At your age!,881
2754,No!,881

2756,"“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble hasbrung these gray hairs and this premature balditude.",882
2757,"Yes, gentlemen,you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”",882
2758,"Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly whatto do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him with us, too.",883
2759,"So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort_him_.",883
2760,"But he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and donewith it all could do him any good; though he said it often made himfeel easier and better for a while if people treated him according tohis rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always calledhim “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn’t setdown in his presence till he asked them.",883
2761,"So Jim and me set tomajestying him, and doing this and that and t’other for him, andstanding up till he told us we might set down.",883
2762,"This done him heaps ofgood, and so he got cheerful and comfortable.",883
2763,"But the duke kind ofsoured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with the way things wasgoing; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said theduke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was agood deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to thepalace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, tillby-and-by the king says:",883
2764,"“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yerraft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ sour?",884
2765,It’ll onlymake things oncomfortable.,884
2766,"It ain’t my fault I warn’t born a duke, itain’t your fault you warn’t born a king—so what’s the use to worry?",884
2767,"Make the best o’ things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto.",884
2768,"This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty grub and an easylife—come, give us your hand, Duke, and le’s all be friends.”",884
2769,"The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.",885
2770,"It tookaway all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, becauseit would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on theraft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybodyto be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.",885
2771,"It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t nokings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.",886
2772,"But Inever said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best way;then you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no trouble.",886
2773,"If theywanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t no objections, ’longas it would keep peace in the family; and it warn’t no use to tell Jim,so I didn’t tell him.",886
2774,"If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, Ilearnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to letthem have their own way.",886
2775,CHAPTER XX.,888
2776,"They asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what wecovered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead ofrunning—was Jim a runaway nigger?",889
2777,Says I:,889
2778,"“Goodness sakes, would a runaway nigger run _south?_”",890
2779,"No, they allowed he wouldn’t.",891
2780,"I had to account for things some way, soI says:",891
2781,"“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, andthey all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.",892
2782,"Pa, he ’lowed he’dbreak up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s got a littleone-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.",892
2783,"Pa waspretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared up there warn’tnothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.",892
2784,"That warn’tenough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.",892
2785,"Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketchedthis piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d go down to Orleans on it.",892
2786,"Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner ofthe raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only fouryears old, so they never come up no more.",892
2787,"Well, for the next day or twowe had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out inskiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he wasa runaway nigger.",892
2788,We don’t run daytimes no more now; nights they don’tbother us.”,892
2789,The duke says:,893
2790,“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if wewant to.,894
2791,I’ll think the thing over—I’ll invent a plan that’ll fix it.,894
2792,"We’ll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don’t want to go bythat town yonder in daylight—it mightn’t be healthy.”",894
2793,"Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heatlightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves wasbeginning to shiver—it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to seethat.",895
2794,"So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to seewhat the beds was like.",895
2795,"My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,which was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in ashuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over thedry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; itmakes such a rustling that you wake up.",895
2796,"Well, the duke allowed he wouldtake my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t.",895
2797,He says:,895
2798,“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to youthat a corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on.,896
2799,YourGrace’ll take the shuck bed yourself.”,896
2800,"Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there wasgoing to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad whenthe duke says:",897
2801,“’Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel ofoppression.,898
2802,"Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, Isubmit; ’tis my fate.",898
2803,I am alone in the world—let me suffer; I can bearit.”,898
2804,We got away as soon as it was good and dark.,899
2805,"The king told us to standwell out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till wegot a long ways below the town.",899
2806,"We come in sight of the little bunch oflights by-and-by—that was the town, you know—and slid by, about a halfa mile out, all right.",899
2807,When we was three-quarters of a mile below wehoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock it come on to rainand blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told usto both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and theduke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.,899
2808,"It was mywatch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in anyway if I’d had abed, because a body don’t see such a storm as that every day in theweek, not by a long sight.",899
2809,"My souls, how the wind did scream along!",899
2810,"Andevery second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps fora half a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty throughthe rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a_h-whack!_—bum!",899
2811,bum!,899
2812,"bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunderwould go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then _rip_ comesanother flash and another sockdolager.",899
2813,"The waves most washed me off theraft sometimes, but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind.",899
2814,We didn’thave no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flitteringaround so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throwher head this way or that and miss them.,899
2815,"I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he wasalways mighty good that way, Jim was.",900
2816,"I crawled into the wigwam, butthe king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t noshow for me; so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain, because it waswarm, and the waves warn’t running so high now.",900
2817,"About two they come upagain, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind,because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to do any harm; but hewas mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes aregular ripper and washed me overboard.",900
2818,It most killed Jim a-laughing.,900
2819,"He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.",900
2820,"I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by-and-bythe storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light thatshowed, I rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quartersfor the day.",901
2821,"The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and himand the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.",902
2822,"Then they gottired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as theycalled it.",902
2823,"The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lotof little printed bills and read them out loud.",902
2824,"One bill said, “Thecelebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “lecture on theScience of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day ofblank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character attwenty-five cents apiece.” The duke said that was _him_.",902
2825,"In anotherbill he was the “world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick theYounger, of Drury Lane, London.” In other bills he had a lot of othernames and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold witha “divining-rod,” “dissipating witch spells,” and so on.",902
2826,By-and-by hesays:,902
2827,“But the histrionic muse is the darling.,903
2828,"Have you ever trod the boards,Royalty?”",903
2829,"“No,” says the king.",904
2830,"“You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen Grandeur,”says the duke.",905
2831,“The first good town we come to we’ll hire a hall and dothe sword fight in Richard III.,905
2832,and the balcony scene in Romeo andJuliet.,905
2833,How does that strike you?”,905
2834,"“I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but,you see, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’, and hain’t ever seenmuch of it.",906
2835,I was too small when pap used to have ’em at the palace.,906
2836,Doyou reckon you can learn me?”,906
2837,“Easy!”,907
2838,“All right.,908
2839,"I’m jist a-freezn’ for something fresh, anyway.",908
2840,Le’scommence right away.”,908
2841,"So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, andsaid he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.",909
2842,"“But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my whitewhiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”",910
2843,"“No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever think of that.",911
2844,"Besides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that makes all thedifference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony, enjoying the moonlightbefore she goes to bed, and she’s got on her night-gown and her rufflednightcap.",911
2845,Here are the costumes for the parts.”,911
2846,"He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said wasmeedyevil armor for Richard III.",912
2847,"and t’other chap, and a long whitecotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.",912
2848,"The king wassatisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in themost splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the sametime, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to theking and told him to get his part by heart.",912
2849,"There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, andafter dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how torun in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed hewould go down to the town and fix that thing.",913
2850,"The king allowed he wouldgo, too, and see if he couldn’t strike something.",913
2851,"We was out of coffee,so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.",913
2852,"When we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, andperfectly dead and still, like Sunday.",914
2853,"We found a sick nigger sunninghimself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t too young ortoo sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back inthe woods.",914
2854,"The king got the directions, and allowed he’d go and workthat camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.",914
2855,The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.,915
2856,"We found it; alittle bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop—carpenters andprinters all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.",915
2857,"It was a dirty,littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures ofhorses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.",915
2858,The duke shedhis coat and said he was all right now.,915
2859,So me and the king lit out forthe camp-meeting.,915
2860,"We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a mostawful hot day.",916
2861,There was as much as a thousand people there from twentymile around.,916
2862,"The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitchedeverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep offthe flies.",916
2863,"There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over withbranches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles ofwatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.",916
2864,"The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they wasbigger and held crowds of people.",917
2865,"The benches was made out of outsideslabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks intofor legs.",917
2866,They didn’t have no backs.,917
2867,The preachers had high platformsto stand on at one end of the sheds.,917
2868,"The women had on sun-bonnets; andsome had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of theyoung ones had on calico.",917
2869,"Some of the young men was barefooted, andsome of the children didn’t have on any clothes but just a tow-linenshirt.",917
2870,"Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folkswas courting on the sly.",917
2871,The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.,918
2872,"He linedout two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; thenhe lined out two more for them to sing—and so on.",918
2873,"The people woke upmore and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end somebegun to groan, and some begun to shout.",918
2874,"Then the preacher begun topreach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one sideof the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over thefront of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, andshouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then hewould hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it aroundthis way and that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in thewilderness!",918
2875,"Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out,“Glory!—A-a-_men!_” And so he went on, and the people groaning andcrying and saying amen:",918

2886,"You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any more, onaccount of the shouting and crying.",920
2887,"Folks got up everywheres in thecrowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners’bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all themourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sungand shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy andwild.",920
2888,"Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear himover everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, andthe preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it.",921
2889,"Hetold them he was a pirate—been a pirate for thirty years out in theIndian Ocean—and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in afight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks togoodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboatwithout a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing thatever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy forthe first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to startright off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in therest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for hecould do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all piratecrews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to getthere without money, he would get there anyway, and every time heconvinced a pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t yougive me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokevillecamp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and thatdear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”",921
2890,"And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.",922
2891,"Then somebodysings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!” Well,a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let _him_pass the hat around!” Then everybody said it, the preacher too.",922
2892,"So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes,and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for beingso good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while theprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks,would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by;and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many asfive or six times—and he was invited to stay a week; and everybodywanted him to live in their houses, and said they’d think it was anhonor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting hecouldn’t do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the IndianOcean right off and go to work on the pirates.",923
2893,When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he hadcollected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.,924
2894,"And then he hadfetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under awagon when he was starting home through the woods.",924
2895,"The king said, takeit all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in themissionarying line.",924
2896,"He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens don’tamount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.",924
2897,"The duke was thinking _he’d_ been doing pretty well till the king cometo show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.",925
2898,"He had set upand printed off two little jobs for farmers in thatprinting-office—horse bills—and took the money, four dollars.",925
2899,"And hehad got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the paper, which hesaid he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance—sothey done it.",925
2900,"The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but hetook in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition ofthem paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood andonions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knockeddown the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run itfor cash.",925
2901,"He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself,out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name ofit was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and he left thatall set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn’t charge nothingfor it.",925
2902,"Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done apretty square day’s work for it.",925
2903,"Then he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t chargedfor, because it was for us.",926
2904,"It had a picture of a runaway nigger with abundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it.",926

2907,"“Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the daytime if wewant to.",927
2908,"Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and footwith a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and saywe captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on asteamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends andare going down to get the reward.",927
2909,"Handcuffs and chains would look stillbetter on Jim, but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us being sopoor.",927
2910,Too much like jewelry.,927
2911,"Ropes are the correct thing—we mustpreserve the unities, as we say on the boards.”",927
2912,"We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no troubleabout running daytimes.",928
2913,We judged we could make miles enough that nightto get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s work inthe printing office was going to make in that little town; then wecould boom right along if we wanted to.,928
2914,"We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly teno’clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’thoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.",929
2915,"When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:",930
2916,"“Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ kings on distrip?”",931
2917,"“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”",932

2923,"It was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up.",937
2924,Theking and the duke turned out by-and-by looking pretty rusty; but afterthey’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a gooddeal.,937
2925,"After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of theraft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let hislegs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe,and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart.",937
2926,"When he had got itpretty good, him and the duke begun to practice it together.",937
2927,"The dukehad to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and hemade him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he saidhe done it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t bellow out_Romeo!_ that way, like a bull—you must say it soft and sick andlanguishy, so—R-o-o-meo!",937
2928,"that is the idea; for Juliet’s a dear sweetmere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray like a jackass.”",937
2929,"Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made outof oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight—the duke calledhimself Richard III.",938
2930,; and the way they laid on and pranced around theraft was grand to see.,938
2931,"But by-and-by the king tripped and felloverboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about allkinds of adventures they’d had in other times along the river.",938
2932,After dinner the duke says:,939
2933,"“Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you know, soI guess we’ll add a little more to it.",940
2934,"We want a little something toanswer encores with, anyway.”",940
2935,"“What’s onkores, Bilgewater?”",941

2943,"I’ll just walk up and down a minute, and seeif I can call it back from recollection’s vaults.”",945
2944,"So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horribleevery now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he wouldsqueeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan;next he would sigh, and next he’d let on to drop a tear.",946
2945,It wasbeautiful to see him.,946
2946,By-and-by he got it.,946
2947,He told us to giveattention.,946
2948,"Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shovedforwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back,looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit histeeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spreadaround, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of anyacting ever _I_ see before.",946
2949,"This is the speech—I learned it, easyenough, while he was learning it to the king:",946
2950,"To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkinThat makes calamity of so long life;For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,But that the fear of something after deathMurders the innocent sleep,Great nature’s second course,And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortuneThan fly to others that we know not of.",947

2960,"The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed; andafter that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was amost uncommon lively place, for there warn’t nothing but sword-fightingand rehearsing—as the duke called it—going on all the time.",949
2961,"Onemorning, when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw, we come insight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up aboutthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which wasshut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim tookthe canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in thatplace for our show.",949

2990,All the stores was along one street.,958
2991,"They had white domestic awnings infront, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.",958
2992,"There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roostingon them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; andchawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornerylot.",958
2993,"They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella,but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, andused considerable many cuss words.",958
2994,"There was as many as one loaferleaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his handsin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chawof tobacco or scratch.",958
2995,What a body was hearing amongst them all thetime was:,958
2996,"“Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”",959
2997,“Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left.,960
2998,Ask Bill.”,960
2999,Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t gotnone.,961
3000,"Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nora chaw of tobacco of their own.",961
3001,"They get all their chawing byborrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me a chaw, Jack, Ijist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which is a liepretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger; but Jackain’t no stranger, so he says:",961
3002,"“_You_ give him a chaw, did you?",962
3003,So did your sister’s cat’sgrandmother.,962

3008,"Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws thenatural leaf twisted.",965
3009,"When they borrow a chaw they don’t generly cut itoff with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnawwith their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get itin two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful atit when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:",965
3010,"“Here, gimme the _chaw_, and you take the _plug_.”",966
3011,"All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else _but_mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, andtwo or three inches deep in _all_ the places.",967
3012,The hogs loafed andgrunted around everywheres.,967
3013,"You’d see a muddy sow and a litter of pigscome lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in theway, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d stretch out and shuther eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look ashappy as if she was on salary.",967
3014,"And pretty soon you’d hear a loafer singout, “Hi!",967
3015,_so_ boy!,967
3016,"sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go,squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, andthree or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all theloafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the funand look grateful for the noise.",967
3017,Then they’d settle back again tillthere was a dog fight.,967
3018,"There couldn’t anything wake them up all over,and make them happy all over, like a dog fight—unless it might beputting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying atin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death.",967
3019,"On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank,and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in.",968
3020,The peoplehad moved out of them.,968
3021,"The bank was caved away under one corner of someothers, and that corner was hanging over.",968

3023,Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deepwill start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into theriver in one summer.,968
3024,"Such a town as that has to be always moving back,and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.",968

3029,"“Here comes old Boggs!—in from the country for his little old monthlydrunk; here he comes, boys!”",970
3030,All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun outof Boggs.,971
3031,One of them says:,971
3032,“Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time.,972
3033,If he’d a-chawed up allthe men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he’d haveconsiderable ruputation now.”,972

3035,"Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like anInjun, and singing out:",974
3036,"“Cler the track, thar.",975
3037,"I’m on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins isa-gwyne to raise.”",975
3038,"He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty yearold, and had a very red face.",976
3039,"Everybody yelled at him and laughed athim and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to themand lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait nowbecause he’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his mottowas, “Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.”",976
3040,"He see me, and rode up and says:",977
3041,"“Whar’d you come f’m, boy?",978
3042,You prepared to die?”,978
3043,Then he rode on.,979
3044,"I was scared, but a man says:",979
3045,“He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on like that when he’sdrunk.,980
3046,"He’s the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody,drunk nor sober.”",980
3047,"Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head downso he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:",981
3048,"“Come out here, Sherburn!",982
3049,Come out and meet the man you’ve swindled.,982
3050,"You’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m a-gwyne to have you, too!”",982
3051,"And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongueto, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing andgoing on.",983
3052,"By-and-by a proud-looking man about fifty-five—and he was aheap the best dressed man in that town, too—steps out of the store, andthe crowd drops back on each side to let him come.",983
3053,"He says to Boggs,mighty ca’m and slow—he says:",983
3054,"“I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock.",984
3055,"Till oneo’clock, mind—no longer.",984
3056,If you open your mouth against me only onceafter that time you can’t travel so far but I will find you.”,984
3057,Then he turns and goes in.,985
3058,"The crowd looked mighty sober; nobodystirred, and there warn’t no more laughing.",985
3059,"Boggs rode offblackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keepingit up.",985
3060,"Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, buthe wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about fifteenminutes, and so he _must_ go home—he must go right away.",985
3061,But it didn’tdo no good.,985
3062,"He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat downin the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging downthe street again, with his gray hair a-flying.",985
3063,"Everybody that could geta chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so theycould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn’t no use—up the streethe would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing.",985
3064,By-and-bysomebody says:,985
3065,"“Go for his daughter!—quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’lllisten to her.",986
3066,"If anybody can persuade him, she can.”",986
3067,So somebody started on a run.,987
3068,I walked down street a ways and stopped.,987
3069,"In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on hishorse.",987
3070,"He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, witha friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying himalong.",987
3071,"He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t hanging back any,but was doing some of the hurrying himself.",987
3072,Somebody sings out:,987
3073,“Boggs!”,988
3074,"I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that ColonelSherburn.",989
3075,"He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had apistol raised in his right hand—not aiming it, but holding it out withthe barrel tilted up towards the sky.",989
3076,"The same second I see a younggirl coming on the run, and two men with her.",989

3078,"Boggs throws up both of his hands andsays, “O Lord, don’t shoot!” Bang!",989
3079,"goes the first shot, and he staggersback, clawing at the air—bang!",989

3082,"givehim air, give him air!”",989
3083,"Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turnedaround on his heels and walked off.",990

3085,"Theylaid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, andopened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open hisshirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in.",991
3086,"He made abouta dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed inhis breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out—and afterthat he laid still; he was dead.",991

3156,throwhim out!” and one or two women begun to scream.,1010

3324,CHAPTER XXIV.,1059
3325,"Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow tow-head outin the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, andthe duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.",1060
3326,"Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a fewhours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had tolay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.",1060
3327,"You see, when we left himall alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him allby himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runawaynigger, you know.",1060
3328,"So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to layroped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.",1060
3329,"He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.",1061
3330,"He dressedJim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and awhite horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paintand painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been drownded nine days.",1061
3331,Blamed ifhe warn’t the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.,1061
3332,Then the duke tookand wrote out a sign on a shingle so:,1061
3333,    _Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head._,1062
3334,"And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four orfive foot in front of the wigwam.",1063
3335,Jim was satisfied.,1063
3336,"He said it was asight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and tremblingall over every time there was a sound.",1063
3337,"The duke told him to makehimself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, hemust hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl ortwo like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leavehim alone.",1063
3338,"Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the averageman, and he wouldn’t wait for him to howl.",1063
3339,"Why, he didn’t only looklike he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.",1063
3340,"These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there wasso much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybethe news might a worked along down by this time.",1064
3341,"They couldn’t hit noproject that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he’dlay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t putup something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he woulddrop over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust inProvidence to lead him the profitable way—meaning the devil, I reckon.",1064
3342,"We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the kingput his’n on, and he told me to put mine on.",1064
3343,"I done it, of course.",1064
3344,"Theking’s duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.",1064
3345,Inever knowed how clothes could change a body before.,1064

3347,"Jim cleaned up the canoe,and I got my paddle ready.",1064
3348,"There was a big steamboat laying at theshore away up under the point, about three mile above the town—beenthere a couple of hours, taking on freight.",1064
3349,Says the king:,1064
3350,"“Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place.",1065
3351,"Go for the steamboat,Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”",1065
3352,I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.,1066

3354,"Pretty soon we come toa nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbingthe sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he hada couple of big carpet-bags by him.",1066
3355,"“Run her nose in shore,” says the king.",1067
3356,I done it.,1067
3357,"“Wher’ you boundfor, young man?”",1067
3358,“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”,1068
3359,"“Git aboard,” says the king.",1069
3360,"“Hold on a minute, my servant ’ll he’p youwith them bags.",1069
3361,"Jump out and he’p the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me,I see.",1069
3362,"I done so, and then we all three started on again.",1070
3363,The young chap wasmighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage suchweather.,1070
3364,"He asked the king where he was going, and the king told himhe’d come down the river and landed at the other village this morning,and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm upthere.",1070
3365,The young fellow says:,1070
3366,"“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks, sure, and hecome mighty near getting here in time.’ But then I says again, ‘No, Ireckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t be paddling up the river.’ You_ain’t_ him, are you?”",1071
3367,"“No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—_Reverend_ ElexanderBlodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ the Lord’s poor servants.",1072
3368,"But still I’m jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arrivingin time, all the same, if he’s missed anything by it—which I hope hehasn’t.”",1072
3369,"“Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll get that allright; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn’tmind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother would a give anythingin this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about nothingelse all these three weeks; hadn’t seen him since they was boystogether—and hadn’t ever seen his brother William at all—that’s thedeef and dumb one—William ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five.",1073
3370,Peterand George were the only ones that come out here; George was themarried brother; him and his wife both died last year.,1073
3371,"Harvey andWilliam’s the only ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, theyhaven’t got here in time.”",1073
3372,“Did anybody send ’em word?”,1074
3373,"“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Petersaid then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well thistime.",1075
3374,"You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young tobe much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and sohe was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn’t seemto care much to live.",1075
3375,"He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—andWilliam, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind thatcan’t bear to make a will.",1075
3376,"He left a letter behind for Harvey, and saidhe’d told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest ofthe property divided up so George’s g’yirls would be all right—forGeorge didn’t leave nothing.",1075
3377,And that letter was all they could get himto put a pen to.”,1075
3378,“Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come?,1076
3379,Wher’ does he live?”,1076
3380,"“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t ever been inthis country.",1077
3381,"He hasn’t had any too much time—and besides he mightn’t agot the letter at all, you know.”",1077
3382,"“Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers, poor soul.",1078
3383,"You going to Orleans, you say?”",1078
3384,"“Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it.",1079
3385,"I’m going in a ship, nextWednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”",1079
3386,“It’s a pretty long journey.,1080
3387,But it’ll be lovely; wisht I was a-going.,1080
3388,Is Mary Jane the oldest?,1080
3389,How old is the others?”,1080
3390,"“Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s aboutfourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works and has ahare-lip.”",1081
3391,“Poor things!,1082
3392,to be left alone in the cold world so.”,1082
3393,"“Well, they could be worse off.",1083
3394,"Old Peter had friends, and they ain’tgoing to let them come to no harm.",1083
3395,"There’s Hobson, the Babtis’preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and thewidow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of them; but these are the onesthat Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, whenhe wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where to look for friends when hegets here.”",1083
3396,"Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptiedthat young fellow.",1084
3397,"Blamed if he didn’t inquire about everybody andeverything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and aboutPeter’s business—which was a tanner; and about George’s—which was acarpenter; and about Harvey’s—which was a dissentering minister; and soon, and so on.",1084
3398,Then he says:,1084
3399,“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”,1085
3400,"“Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t stopthere.",1086
3401,When they’re deep they won’t stop for a hail.,1086
3402,"A Cincinnati boatwill, but this is a St. Louis one.”",1086
3403,“Was Peter Wilks well off?”,1087
3404,"“Oh, yes, pretty well off.",1088
3405,"He had houses and land, and it’s reckoned heleft three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”",1088
3406,“When did you say he died?”,1089
3407,"“I didn’t say, but it was last night.”",1090
3408,"“Funeral to-morrow, likely?”",1091
3409,"“Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”",1092
3410,"“Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go, one time oranother.",1093
3411,So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re allright.”,1093
3412,"“Yes, sir, it’s the best way.",1094
3413,Ma used to always say that.”,1094
3414,"When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon shegot off.",1095
3415,"The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost myride, after all.",1095
3416,"When the boat was gone the king made me paddle upanother mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:",1095
3417,"“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the newcarpet-bags.",1096
3418,"And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go over there andgit him.",1096
3419,And tell him to git himself up regardless.,1096
3420,"Shove along, now.”",1096
3421,"I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.",1097
3422,"When Igot back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on alog, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow hadsaid it—every last word of it.",1097
3423,"And all the time he was a-doing it hetried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, fora slouch.",1097
3424,"I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t a-going to try to; but hereally done it pretty good.",1097
3425,Then he says:,1097
3426,"“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”",1098
3427,"The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef anddumb person on the histronic boards.",1099
3428,So then they waited for asteamboat.,1099
3429,"About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,but they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last therewas a big one, and they hailed her.",1100
3430,"She sent out her yawl, and we wentaboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wantedto go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing,and said they wouldn’t land us.",1100
3431,But the king was ca’m.,1100
3432,He says:,1100
3433,"“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took onand put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ’em, can’t it?”",1101
3434,So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to thevillage they yawled us ashore.,1102
3435,"About two dozen men flocked down whenthey see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:",1102
3436,"“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” theygive a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as tosay, “What d’ I tell you?” Then one of them says, kind of soft andgentle:",1103
3437,"“I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_live yesterday evening.”",1104
3438,"Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell upagainst the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down hisback, and says:",1105
3439,"“Alas, alas, our poor brother—gone, and we never got to see him; oh,it’s too, _too_ hard!”",1106
3440,"Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs tothe duke on his hands, and blamed if _he_ didn’t drop a carpet-bag andbust out a-crying.",1107
3441,"If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two frauds,that ever I struck.",1107
3442,"Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said allsorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hillfor them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king allabout his brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all overagain on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about thatdead tanner like they’d lost the twelve disciples.",1108
3443,"Well, if ever Istruck anything like it, I’m a nigger.",1108
3444,It was enough to make a bodyashamed of the human race.,1108
3445,CHAPTER XXV.,1110
3446,"The news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the peopletearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting ontheir coats as they come.",1111
3447,"Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd,and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march.",1111
3448,"The windows anddooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:",1111
3449,“Is it _them?_”,1112
3450,And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:,1113
3451,“You bet it is.”,1114
3452,"When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and thethree girls was standing in the door.",1115
3453,"Mary Jane _was_ red-headed, butthat don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and herface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncleswas come.",1115
3454,"The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped forthem, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they _had_ it!",1115
3455,"Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet againat last and have such good times.",1115
3456,"Then the king he hunched the duke private—I see him do it—and then helooked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; sothen him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder, andt’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there,everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noisestopping, people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off anddrooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.",1116
3457,"And when theygot there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight,and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans,most; and then they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hungtheir chins over each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes, ormaybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done.",1116
3458,"And, mind you,everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never seeanything like it.",1116
3459,"Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, andt’other on t’other side, and they kneeled down and rested theirforeheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves.",1116
3460,"Well,when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anythinglike it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right outloud—the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to thegirls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead,and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky,with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbingand swabbing, and give the next woman a show.",1116
3461,I never see anything sodisgusting.,1116
3462,"Well, by-and-by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, andworks himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears andflapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother tolose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the longjourney of four thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened andsanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so hethanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, becauseout of their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and allthat kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then heblubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goesto crying fit to bust.",1117
3463,"And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in thecrowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all theirmight, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as churchletting out.",1118
3464,"Music _is_ a good thing; and after all that soul-butterand hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honestand bully.",1118
3465,"Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and hisnieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of thefamily would take supper here with them this evening, and help set upwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother layingyonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names thatwas very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so hewill name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev.",1119
3466,"Mr. Hobson, andDeacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and LeviBell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.",1119
3467,Rev.,1120
3468,"Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-huntingtogether—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’otherworld, and the preacher was pinting him right.",1120
3469,Lawyer Bell was away upto Louisville on business.,1120
3470,"But the rest was on hand, and so they allcome and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;and then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, butjust kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheadswhilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said“Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo” all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.",1120
3471,"So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about prettymuch everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts oflittle things that happened one time or another in the town, or toGeorge’s family, or to Peter.",1121
3472,And he always let on that Peter wrote himthe things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out ofthat young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.,1121
3473,"Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and theking he read it out loud and cried over it.",1122
3474,"It give the dwelling-houseand three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses andland (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in goldto Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hiddown cellar.",1122
3475,"So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, andhave everything square and above-board; and told me to come with acandle.",1122
3476,"We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bagthey spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all themyaller-boys.",1122
3477,"My, the way the king’s eyes did shine!",1122
3478,He slaps the dukeon the shoulder and says:,1122
3479,"“Oh, _this_ ain’t bully nor noth’n!",1123
3480,"Oh, no, I reckon not!",1123
3481,"Why, Bilji,it beats the Nonesuch, _don’t_ it?”",1123
3482,The duke allowed it did.,1124
3483,"They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted themthrough their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and theking says:",1124
3484,"“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich dead man andrepresentatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the line for you andme, Bilge.",1125
3485,Thish yer comes of trust’n to Providence.,1125
3486,"It’s the best way,in the long run.",1125
3487,"I’ve tried ’em all, and ther’ ain’t no better way.”",1125
3488,"Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it ontrust; but no, they must count it.",1126
3489,"So they counts it, and it comes outfour hundred and fifteen dollars short.",1126
3490,Says the king:,1126
3491,"“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteendollars?”",1127
3492,"They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it.",1128
3493,Thenthe duke says:,1128
3494,"“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake—I reckonthat’s the way of it.",1129
3495,"The best way’s to let it go, and keep still aboutit.",1129
3496,We can spare it.”,1129
3497,"“Oh, shucks, yes, we can _spare_ it.",1130
3498,I don’t k’yer noth’n ’boutthat—it’s the _count_ I’m thinkin’ about.,1130
3499,"We want to be awful squareand open and above-board here, you know.",1130
3500,We want to lug this h-yermoney up stairs and count it before everybody—then ther’ ain’t noth’nsuspicious.,1130
3501,"But when the dead man says ther’s six thous’n dollars, youknow, we don’t want to—”",1130
3502,"“Hold on,” says the duke.",1131
3503,"“Le’s make up the deffisit,” and he begun tohaul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.",1131
3504,"“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke—you _have_ got a rattlin’ cleverhead on you,” says the king.",1132
3505,"“Blest if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’us out agin,” and _he_ begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack themup.",1132
3506,"It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.",1133
3507,"“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea.",1134
3508,"Le’s go up stairs and countthis money, and then take and _give it to the girls_.”",1134
3509,"“Good land, duke, lemme hug you!",1135
3510,It’s the most dazzling idea ’at ever aman struck.,1135
3511,You have cert’nly got the most astonishin’ head I ever see.,1135
3512,"Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ ain’t no mistake ’bout it.",1135
3513,Let ’emfetch along their suspicions now if they want to—this’ll lay ’em out.”,1135
3514,"When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the kinghe counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile—twentyelegant little piles.",1136
3515,"Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked theirchops.",1136
3516,"Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the king beginto swell himself up for another speech.",1136
3517,He says:,1136
3518,"“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous bythem that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers.",1137
3519,"He has done generous bythese yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that’sleft fatherless and motherless.",1137
3520,"Yes, and we that knowed him knows thathe would a done _more_ generous by ’em if he hadn’t ben afeard o’woundin’ his dear William and me.",1137
3521,"Now, _wouldn’t_ he?",1137
3522,Ther’ ain’t noquestion ’bout it in _my_ mind.,1137
3523,"Well, then, what kind o’ brothers wouldit be that ’d stand in his way at sech a time?",1137
3524,"And what kind o’ uncleswould it be that ’d rob—yes, _rob_—sech poor sweet lambs as these ’athe loved so at sech a time?",1137
3525,"If I know William—and I _think_ Ido—he—well, I’ll jest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make alot of signs to the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at himstupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems tocatch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all hismight for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up.",1137
3526,"Thenthe king says, “I knowed it; I reckon _that_’ll convince anybody theway _he_ feels about it.",1137
3527,"Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take themoney—take it _all_.",1137
3528,"It’s the gift of him that lays yonder, cold butjoyful.”",1137
3529,"Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke,and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet.",1138
3530,"Andeverybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook thehands off of them frauds, saying all the time:",1138
3531,“You _dear_ good souls!—how _lovely!_—how _could_ you!”,1139
3532,"Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseasedagain, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; andbefore long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobodysaying anything to him either, because the king was talking and theywas all busy listening.",1140
3533,The king was saying—in the middle of somethinghe’d started in on—,1140
3534,“—they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased.,1141
3535,"That’s why they’reinvited here this evenin’; but tomorrow we want _all_ tocome—everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and soit’s fitten that his funeral orgies sh’d be public.”",1141
3536,"And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, andevery little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till theduke he couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap ofpaper, “_obsequies_, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes togoo-gooing and reaching it over people’s heads to him.",1142
3537,"The king hereads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:",1142
3538,"“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his _heart’s_ aluz right.",1143
3539,Asks me toinvite everybody to come to the funeral—wants me to make ’em allwelcome.,1143
3540,But he needn’t a worried—it was jest what I was at.”,1143
3541,"Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in hisfuneral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.",1144
3542,Andwhen he done it the third time he says:,1144
3543,"“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because itain’t—obsequies bein’ the common term—but because orgies is the rightterm.",1145
3544,Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now—it’s gone out.,1145
3545,We sayorgies now in England.,1145
3546,"Orgies is better, because it means the thingyou’re after more exact.",1145
3547,"It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek_orgo_, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew _jeesum_, to plant, coverup; hence in_ter._ So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er publicfuneral.”",1145
3548,He was the _worst_ I ever struck.,1146
3549,"Well, the iron-jawed man he laughedright in his face.",1146
3550,Everybody was shocked.,1146
3551,"Everybody says, “Why,_doctor!_” and Abner Shackleford says:",1146
3552,"“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news?",1147
3553,This is Harvey Wilks.”,1147
3554,"The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:",1148
3555,“_Is_ it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician?,1149
3556,I—”,1149
3557,“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor.,1150
3558,"“_You_ talk like anEnglishman, _don’t_ you?",1150
3559,It’s the worst imitation I ever heard.,1150
3560,_You_Peter Wilks’s brother!,1150
3561,"You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!”",1150
3562,"Well, how they all took on!",1151
3563,"They crowded around the doctor and tried toquiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey ’dshowed in forty ways that he _was_ Harvey, and knowed everybody byname, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and _begged_ him notto hurt Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings, and all that.",1151
3564,"But it warn’t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man thatpretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no betterthan what he did was a fraud and a liar.",1151
3565,The poor girls was hanging tothe king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on_them_.,1151
3566,He says:,1151
3567,"“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I warn you _as_ afriend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out ofharm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothingto do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,as he calls it.",1152
3568,"He is the thinnest kind of an impostor—has come herewith a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, andyou take them for _proofs_, and are helped to fool yourselves by thesefoolish friends here, who ought to know better.",1152
3569,"Mary Jane Wilks, youknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too.",1152
3570,Now listento me; turn this pitiful rascal out—I _beg_ you to do it.,1152
3571,Will you?”,1152
3572,"Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome!",1153
3573,Shesays:,1153
3574,"“_Here_ is my answer.” She hove up the bag of money and put it in theking’s hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest forme and my sisters any way you want to, and don’t give us no receipt forit.”",1154
3575,"Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and thehare-lip done the same on the other.",1155
3576,"Everybody clapped their hands andstomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up hishead and smiled proud.",1155
3577,The doctor says:,1155
3578,“All right; I wash _my_ hands of the matter.,1156
3579,But I warn you all that atime ’s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think ofthis day.” And away he went.,1156
3580,"“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “we’ll try andget ’em to send for you;” which made them all laugh, and they said itwas a prime good hit.",1157
3581,CHAPTER XXVI.,1159
3582,"Well, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they wasoff for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which woulddo for Uncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey,which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with hersisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with apallet in it.",1160
3583,The king said the cubby would do for his valley—meaningme.,1160
3584,"So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which wasplain but nice.",1161
3585,"She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other trapstook out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he saidthey warn’t.",1161
3586,"The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was acurtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.",1161
3587,"There was anold hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and allsorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken upa room with.",1161
3588,"The king said it was all the more homely and morepleasanter for these fixings, and so don’t disturb them.",1161
3589,"The duke’sroom was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.",1161
3590,"That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,and I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on them,and the niggers waited on the rest.",1162
3591,"Mary Jane she set at the head ofthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuitswas, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the friedchickens was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for toforce out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop,and said so—said “How _do_ you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and“Where, for the land’s sake, _did_ you get these amaz’n pickles?” andall that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does ata supper, you know.",1162
3592,"And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchenoff of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean upthe things.",1163
3593,"The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blestif I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes.",1163
3594,She says:,1163
3595,“Did you ever see the king?”,1164
3596,“Who?,1165
3597,William Fourth?,1165
3598,"Well, I bet I have—he goes to our church.” Iknowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on.",1165
3599,"So when I says hegoes to our church, she says:",1165
3600,“What—regular?”,1166
3601,“Yes—regular.,1167
3602,His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on t’other side thepulpit.”,1167
3603,“I thought he lived in London?”,1168
3604,"“Well, he does.",1169
3605,Where _would_ he live?”,1169
3606,“But I thought _you_ lived in Sheffield?”,1170
3607,I see I was up a stump.,1171
3608,"I had to let on to get choked with a chickenbone, so as to get time to think how to get down again.",1171
3609,Then I says:,1171
3610,“I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield.,1172
3611,"That’sonly in the summer time, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”",1172
3612,"“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”",1173
3613,"“Well, who said it was?”",1174
3614,"“Why, you did.”",1175
3615,“I _didn’t_ nuther.”,1176
3616,“You did!”,1177
3617,“I didn’t.”,1178
3618,“You did.”,1179
3619,“I never said nothing of the kind.”,1180
3620,"“Well, what _did_ you say, then?”",1181
3621,“Said he come to take the sea _baths_—that’s what I said.”,1182
3622,"“Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t on thesea?”",1183
3623,"“Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any Congress-water?”",1184
3624,“Yes.”,1185
3625,"“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”",1186
3626,"“Why, no.”",1187
3627,"“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a seabath.”",1188
3628,"“How does he get it, then?”",1189
3629,“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels.,1190
3630,"Therein the palace at Sheffield they’ve got furnaces, and he wants his waterhot.",1190
3631,They can’t bile that amount of water away off there at the sea.,1190
3632,They haven’t got no conveniences for it.”,1190
3633,"“Oh, I see, now.",1191
3634,You might a said that in the first place and savedtime.”,1191
3635,"When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I wascomfortable and glad.",1192
3636,"Next, she says:",1192
3637,"“Do you go to church, too?”",1193
3638,“Yes—regular.”,1194
3639,“Where do you set?”,1195
3640,"“Why, in our pew.”",1196
3641,“_Whose_ pew?”,1197
3642,"“Why, _ourn_—your Uncle Harvey’s.”",1198
3643,“His’n?,1199
3644,What does _he_ want with a pew?”,1199
3645,“Wants it to set in.,1200
3646,What did you _reckon_ he wanted with it?”,1200
3647,"“Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”",1201
3648,"Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher.",1202
3649,"I see I was up a stump again, so Iplayed another chicken bone and got another think.",1202
3650,Then I says:,1202
3651,"“Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a church?”",1203
3652,"“Why, what do they want with more?”",1204
3653,“What!—to preach before a king?,1205
3654,I never did see such a girl as you.,1205
3655,They don’t have no less than seventeen.”,1205
3656,“Seventeen!,1206
3657,My land!,1206
3658,"Why, I wouldn’t set out such a string as that, notif I _never_ got to glory.",1206
3659,It must take ’em a week.”,1206
3660,"“Shucks, they don’t _all_ of ’em preach the same day—only _one_ of’em.”",1207
3661,"“Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?”",1208
3662,"“Oh, nothing much.",1209
3663,"Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing oranother.",1209
3664,But mainly they don’t do nothing.”,1209
3665,"“Well, then, what are they _for?_”",1210
3666,"“Why, they’re for _style_.",1211
3667,Don’t you know nothing?”,1211
3668,"“Well, I don’t _want_ to know no such foolishness as that.",1212
3669,How isservants treated in England?,1212
3670,Do they treat ’em better ’n we treat ourniggers?”,1212
3671,“_No!_ A servant ain’t nobody there.,1213
3672,They treat them worse than dogs.”,1213
3673,"“Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year’sweek, and Fourth of July?”",1214
3674,"“Oh, just listen!",1215
3675,A body could tell _you_ hain’t ever been to Englandby that.,1215
3676,"Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year’send to year’s end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor niggershows, nor nowheres.”",1215
3677,“Nor church?”,1216
3678,“Nor church.”,1217
3679,“But _you_ always went to church.”,1218
3680,"Well, I was gone up again.",1219
3681,I forgot I was the old man’s servant.,1219
3682,"Butnext minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley wasdifferent from a common servant and _had_ to go to church whether hewanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of its being thelaw.",1219
3683,"But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I got done I see shewarn’t satisfied.",1219
3684,She says:,1219
3685,"“Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?”",1220
3686,"“Honest injun,” says I.",1221
3687,“None of it at all?”,1222
3688,“None of it at all.,1223
3689,"Not a lie in it,” says I.",1223
3690,“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”,1224
3691,"I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it andsaid it.",1225
3692,"So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:",1225
3693,"“Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I’llbelieve the rest.”",1226
3694,"“What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane, stepping in withSusan behind her.",1227
3695,"“It ain’t right nor kind for you to talk so to him,and him a stranger and so far from his people.",1227
3696,How would you like to betreated so?”,1227
3697,"“That’s always your way, Maim—always sailing in to help somebody beforethey’re hurt.",1228
3698,I hain’t done nothing to him.,1228
3699,"He’s told some stretchers,I reckon, and I said I wouldn’t swallow it all; and that’s every bitand grain I _did_ say.",1228
3700,"I reckon he can stand a little thing like that,can’t he?”",1228
3701,"“I don’t care whether ’twas little or whether ’twas big; he’s here inour house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good of you to say it.",1229
3702,If youwas in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn’t tosay a thing to another person that will make _them_ feel ashamed.”,1229
3703,"“Why, Mam, he said—”",1230
3704,“It don’t make no difference what he _said_—that ain’t the thing.,1231
3705,"Thething is for you to treat him _kind_, and not be saying things to makehim remember he ain’t in his own country and amongst his own folks.”",1231
3706,"I says to myself, _this_ is a girl that I’m letting that old reptilerob her of her money!",1232
3707,"Then Susan _she_ waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did giveHare-lip hark from the tomb!",1233
3708,"Says I to myself, and this is _another_ one that I’m letting him robher of her money!",1234
3709,"Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovelyagain—which was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardlyanything left o’ poor Hare-lip.",1235
3710,So she hollered.,1235
3711,"“All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask his pardon.”",1236
3712,"She done it, too; and she done it beautiful.",1237
3713,"She done it so beautifulit was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, soshe could do it again.",1237
3714,"I says to myself, this is _another_ one that I’m letting him rob her ofher money.",1238
3715,And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves outto make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.,1238
3716,"I felt soornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my mind’s made up;I’ll hive that money for them or bust.",1238
3717,"So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.",1239
3718,When Igot by myself I went to thinking the thing over.,1239
3719,"I says to myself,shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?",1239
3720,No—thatwon’t do.,1239
3721,He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke wouldmake it warm for me.,1239
3722,"Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?",1239
3723,No—Idasn’t do it.,1239
3724,"Her face would give them a hint, sure; they’ve got themoney, and they’d slide right out and get away with it.",1239
3725,"If she was tofetch in help I’d get mixed up in the business before it was done with,I judge.",1239
3726,No; there ain’t no good way but one.,1239
3727,"I got to steal thatmoney, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’tsuspicion that I done it.",1239
3728,"They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’ta-going to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for allthey’re worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough.",1239
3729,"I’ll steal it andhide it; and by-and-by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll write aletter and tell Mary Jane where it’s hid.",1239
3730,"But I better hive it tonightif I can, because the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as much as he lets onhe has; he might scare them out of here yet.",1239
3731,"So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms.",1240
3732,"Upstairs the hall wasdark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it with myhands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king to letanybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I wentto his room and begun to paw around there.",1240
3733,"But I see I couldn’t donothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course.",1240
3734,So Ijudged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop.,1240
3735,"Aboutthat time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip underthe bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t where I thought it would be;but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s frocks, so I jumped inbehind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood thereperfectly still.",1240
3736,They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done wasto get down and look under the bed.,1241
3737,Then I was glad I hadn’t found thebed when I wanted it.,1241
3738,"And yet, you know, it’s kind of natural to hideunder the bed when you are up to anything private.",1241
3739,"They sets down then,and the king says:",1241
3740,"“Well, what is it?",1242
3741,"And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s better forus to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than up here givin’ ’ema chance to talk us over.”",1242
3742,"“Well, this is it, Capet.",1243
3743,I ain’t easy; I ain’t comfortable.,1243
3744,Thatdoctor lays on my mind.,1243
3745,I wanted to know your plans.,1243
3746,"I’ve got a notion,and I think it’s a sound one.”",1243
3747,"“What is it, duke?”",1244
3748,"“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clipit down the river with what we’ve got.",1245
3749,"Specially, seeing we got it soeasy—_given_ back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when ofcourse we allowed to have to steal it back.",1245
3750,I’m for knocking off andlighting out.”,1245
3751,That made me feel pretty bad.,1246
3752,"About an hour or two ago it would a beena little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed.",1246
3753,Theking rips out and says:,1246
3754,“What!,1247
3755,And not sell out the rest o’ the property?,1247
3756,"March off like apassel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ dollars’ worth o’property layin’ around jest sufferin’ to be scooped in?—and all good,salable stuff, too.”",1247
3757,"The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’twant to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of_everything_ they had.",1248
3758,"“Why, how you talk!” says the king.",1249
3759,“We sha’n’t rob ’em of nothing atall but jest this money.,1249
3760,"The people that _buys_ the property is thesuff’rers; because as soon ’s it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—whichwon’t be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it’ll allgo back to the estate.",1249
3761,"These yer orphans ’ll git their house back agin,and that’s enough for _them;_ they’re young and spry, and k’n easy earna livin’.",1249
3762,_They_ ain’t a-goin to suffer.,1249
3763,"Why, jest think—there’sthous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so well off.",1249
3764,"Bless you, _they_ain’t got noth’n’ to complain of.”",1249
3765,"Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said allright, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and thatdoctor hanging over them.",1250
3766,But the king says:,1250
3767,“Cuss the doctor!,1251
3768,What do we k’yer for _him?_ Hain’t we got all thefools in town on our side?,1251
3769,And ain’t that a big enough majority in anytown?”,1251
3770,So they got ready to go down stairs again.,1252
3771,The duke says:,1252
3772,“I don’t think we put that money in a good place.”,1253
3773,That cheered me up.,1254
3774,I’d begun to think I warn’t going to get a hint ofno kind to help me.,1254
3775,The king says:,1254
3776,“Why?”,1255
3777,“Because Mary Jane ’ll be in mourning from this out; and first you knowthe nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these dudsup and put ’em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across moneyand not borrow some of it?”,1256
3778,"“Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he comes a-fumblingunder the curtain two or three foot from where I was.",1257
3779,"I stuck tight tothe wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered whatthem fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to thinkwhat I’d better do if they did catch me.",1257
3780,"But the king he got the bagbefore I could think more than about a half a thought, and he neversuspicioned I was around.",1257
3781,"They took and shoved the bag through a rip inthe straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and crammed it in a footor two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because anigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don’t turn over the strawtick only about twice a year, and so it warn’t in no danger of gettingstole now.",1257
3782,But I knowed better.,1258
3783,I had it out of there before they was half-waydown stairs.,1258
3784,"I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till Icould get a chance to do better.",1258
3785,"I judged I better hide it outside ofthe house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give thehouse a good ransacking: I knowed that very well.",1258
3786,"Then I turned in,with my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if I’d a wantedto, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business.",1258
3787,"By-and-by Iheard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laidwith my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything wasgoing to happen.",1258
3788,But nothing did.,1258
3789,So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early oneshadn’t begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.,1259
3790,CHAPTER XXVII.,1261
3791,I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring.,1262
3792,"So I tiptoedalong, and got down stairs all right.",1262
3793,There warn’t a sound anywheres.,1262
3794,"Ipeeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men thatwas watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.",1262
3795,"The door wasopen into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was acandle in both rooms.",1262
3796,"I passed along, and the parlor door was open; butI see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so Ishoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t there.",1262
3797,"Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me.",1262
3798,"Irun in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place Isee to hide the bag was in the coffin.",1262
3799,"The lid was shoved along about afoot, showing the dead man’s face down in there, with a wet cloth overit, and his shroud on.",1262
3800,"I tucked the money-bag in under the lid, justdown beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they wasso cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.",1262
3801,The person coming was Mary Jane.,1263
3802,"She went to the coffin, very soft, andkneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I seeshe begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was to me.",1263
3803,"Islid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d make sure themwatchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everythingwas all right.",1263
3804,They hadn’t stirred.,1263
3805,"I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thingplaying out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so muchresk about it.",1264
3806,"Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; becausewhen we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back toMary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’tthe thing that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is,the money ’ll be found when they come to screw on the lid.",1264
3807,"Then theking ’ll get it again, and it ’ll be a long day before he gives anybodyanother chance to smouch it from him.",1264
3808,"Of course I _wanted_ to slidedown and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it.",1264
3809,"Every minute it wasgetting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would beginto stir, and I might get catched—catched with six thousand dollars inmy hands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take care of.",1264
3810,"I don’t wish tobe mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.",1264
3811,"When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and thewatchers was gone.",1265
3812,There warn’t nobody around but the family and thewidow Bartley and our tribe.,1265
3813,"I watched their faces to see if anythinghad been happening, but I couldn’t tell.",1265
3814,"Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, andthey set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs,and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from theneighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full.",1266
3815,"Isee the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to lookin under it, with folks around.",1266
3816,"Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls tookseats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half anhour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down atthe dead man’s face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it wasall very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holdinghandkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing alittle.",1267
3817,There warn’t no other sound but the scraping of the feet on thefloor and blowing noses—because people always blows them more at afuneral than they do at other places except church.,1267
3818,"When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in hisblack gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the lasttouches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable,and making no more sound than a cat.",1268
3819,"He never spoke; he moved peoplearound, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done itwith nods, and signs with his hands.",1268
3820,Then he took his place overagainst the wall.,1268
3821,"He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man Iever see; and there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.",1268
3822,"They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was readya young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky andcolicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only onethat had a good thing, according to my notion.",1269
3823,"Then the Reverend Hobsonopened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off themost outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it wasonly one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it upright along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, andwait—you couldn’t hear yourself think.",1269
3824,"It was right down awkward, andnobody didn’t seem to know what to do.",1269
3825,"But pretty soon they see thatlong-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say,“Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun toglide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people’sheads.",1269
3826,"So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more andmore outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around twosides of the room, he disappears down cellar.",1269
3827,"Then in about two secondswe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howlor two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun hissolemn talk where he left off.",1269
3828,"In a minute or two here comes thisundertaker’s back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so heglided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, andshaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards thepreacher, over the people’s heads, and says, in a kind of a coarsewhisper, “_He had a rat!_” Then he drooped down and glided along thewall again to his place.",1269
3829,"You could see it was a great satisfaction tothe people, because naturally they wanted to know.",1269
3830,"A little thing likethat don’t cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes aman to be looked up to and liked.",1269
3831,There warn’t no more popular man intown than what that undertaker was.,1269
3832,"Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome;and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage,and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak upon the coffin with his screw-driver.",1270
3833,"I was in a sweat then, and watchedhim pretty keen.",1270
3834,"But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid alongas soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.",1270
3835,So there I was!,1270
3836,Ididn’t know whether the money was in there or not.,1270
3837,"So, says I, s’posesomebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do _I_ know whether towrite to Mary Jane or not?",1270
3838,"S’pose she dug him up and didn’t findnothing, what would she think of me?",1270
3839,"Blame it, I says, I might gethunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark, and not writeat all; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better it, I’ve worsenedit a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d just let it alone, dadfetch the whole business!",1270
3840,"They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching facesagain—I couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy.",1271
3841,But nothing come ofit; the faces didn’t tell me nothing.,1271
3842,"The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up,and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that hiscongregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he musthurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.",1272
3843,"He wasvery sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he couldstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done.",1272
3844,"And hesaid of course him and William would take the girls home with them; andthat pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixedand amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickledthem so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; andtold him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready.",1272
3845,"Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to seethem getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for meto chip in and change the general tune.",1272
3846,"Well, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and allthe property for auction straight off—sale two days after the funeral;but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.",1273
3847,"So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’joy got the first jolt.",1274
3848,"A couple of nigger traders come along, and theking sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as theycalled it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis,and their mother down the river to Orleans.",1274
3849,"I thought them poor girlsand them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried aroundeach other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it.",1274
3850,Thegirls said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated orsold away from the town.,1274
3851,"I can’t ever get it out of my memory, thesight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around eachother’s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood it all, butwould a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t knowed thesale warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home in a week ortwo.",1274
3852,"The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come outflatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and thechildren that way.",1275
3853,"It injured the frauds some; but the old fool hebulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tellyou the duke was powerful uneasy.",1275
3854,Next day was auction day.,1276
3855,"About broad day in the morning the king andthe duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their lookthat there was trouble.",1276
3856,The king says:,1276
3857,“Was you in my room night before last?”,1277
3858,"“No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him when nobodybut our gang warn’t around.",1278
3859,“Was you in there yisterday er last night?”,1279
3860,"“No, your majesty.”",1280
3861,"“Honor bright, now—no lies.”",1281
3862,"“Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth.",1282
3863,I hain’t beena-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showedit to you.”,1282
3864,The duke says:,1283
3865,“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”,1284
3866,"“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”",1285
3867,“Stop and think.”,1286
3868,I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:,1287
3869,"“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”",1288
3870,"Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t everexpected it, and then like they _had_.",1289
3871,Then the duke says:,1289
3872,"“What, _all_ of them?”",1290
3873,"“No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t think I ever see themall come _out_ at once but just one time.”",1291
3874,“Hello!,1292
3875,When was that?”,1292
3876,“It was the day we had the funeral.,1293
3877,In the morning.,1293
3878,"It warn’t early,because I overslept.",1293
3879,"I was just starting down the ladder, and I seethem.”",1293
3880,"“Well, go on, _go_ on!",1294
3881,What did they do?,1294
3882,How’d they act?”,1294
3883,“They didn’t do nothing.,1295
3884,"And they didn’t act anyway much, as fur as Isee.",1295
3885,"They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they’d shoved inthere to do up your majesty’s room, or something, s’posing you was up;and found you _warn’t_ up, and so they was hoping to slide out of theway of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked youup.”",1295
3886,"“Great guns, _this_ is a go!” says the king; and both of them lookedpretty sick and tolerable silly.",1296
3887,"They stood there a-thinking andscratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of alittle raspy chuckle, and says:",1296
3888,“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand.,1297
3889,They let onto be _sorry_ they was going out of this region!,1297
3890,"And I believed they_was_ sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.",1297
3891,Don’t ever tell _me_any more that a nigger ain’t got any histrionic talent.,1297
3892,"Why, the waythey played that thing it would fool _anybody_.",1297
3893,"In my opinion, there’sa fortune in ’em.",1297
3894,"If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want abetter lay-out than that—and here we’ve gone and sold ’em for a song.",1297
3895,"Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet.",1297
3896,"Say, where _is_ thatsong—that draft?”",1297
3897,“In the bank for to be collected.,1298
3898,Where _would_ it be?”,1298
3899,"“Well, _that’s_ all right then, thank goodness.”",1299
3900,"Says I, kind of timid-like:",1300
3901,“Is something gone wrong?”,1301
3902,The king whirls on me and rips out:,1302
3903,“None o’ your business!,1303
3904,"You keep your head shet, and mind y’r ownaffairs—if you got any.",1303
3905,"Long as you’re in this town don’t you forgit_that_—you hear?” Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller itand say noth’n’: mum’s the word for _us_.”",1303
3906,"As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, andsays:",1304
3907,“Quick sales _and_ small profits!,1305
3908,It’s a good business—yes.”,1305
3909,v,1306
3910,The king snarls around on him and says:,1307
3911,“I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so quick.,1308
3912,"If theprofits has turned out to be none, lackin’ considable, and none tocarry, is it my fault any more’n it’s yourn?”",1308
3913,"“Well, _they’d_ be in this house yet and we _wouldn’t_ if I could a gotmy advice listened to.”",1309
3914,"The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swappedaround and lit into _me_ again.",1310
3915,He give me down the banks for notcoming and _telling_ him I see the niggers come out of his room actingthat way—said any fool would a _knowed_ something was up.,1310
3916,"And thenwaltzed in and cussed _himself_ awhile, and said it all come of him notlaying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he’d beblamed if he’d ever do it again.",1310
3917,"So they went off a-jawing; and I feltdreadful glad I’d worked it all off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’tdone the niggers no harm by it.",1310
3918,CHAPTER XXVIII.,1312
3919,By-and-by it was getting-up time.,1313
3920,"So I come down the ladder and startedfor down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door was open,and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open andshe’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England.",1313
3921,"But shehad stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in herhands, crying.",1313
3922,I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would.,1313
3923,Iwent in there and says:,1313
3924,"“Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble, and _I_can’t—most always.",1314
3925,Tell me about it.”,1314
3926,So she done it.,1315
3927,And it was the niggers—I just expected it.,1315
3928,"She said thebeautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn’tknow _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother andthe children warn’t ever going to see each other no more—and thenbusted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:",1315
3929,"“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t _ever_ going to see each other anymore!”",1316
3930,“But they _will_—and inside of two weeks—and I _know_ it!” says I.,1317
3931,"Laws, it was out before I could think!",1318
3932,"And before I could budge shethrows her arms around my neck and told me to say it _again_, say it_again_, say it _again!_",1318
3933,"I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a closeplace.",1319
3934,"I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, veryimpatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy andeased-up, like a person that’s had a tooth pulled out.",1319
3935,So I went tostudying it out.,1319
3936,"I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tellsthe truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable manyresks, though I ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; butit looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest if itdon’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than alie.",1319
3937,"I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other,it’s so kind of strange and unregular.",1319
3938,I never see nothing like it.,1319
3939,"Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance it; I’ll up andtell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down ona kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you’ll go to.",1319
3940,Then I says:,1319
3941,"“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where youcould go and stay three or four days?”",1320
3942,“Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s.,1321
3943,Why?”,1321
3944,“Never mind why yet.,1322
3945,If I’ll tell you how I know the niggers will seeeach other again inside of two weeks—here in this house—and _prove_ howI know it—will you go to Mr. Lothrop’s and stay four days?”,1322
3946,“Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”,1323
3947,"“All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more out of _you_ than justyour word—I druther have it than another man’s kiss-the-Bible.” Shesmiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it,I’ll shut the door—and bolt it.”",1324
3948,"Then I come back and set down again, and says:",1325
3949,“Don’t you holler.,1326
3950,Just set still and take it like a man.,1326
3951,"I got to tellthe truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it’s a badkind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t no help for it.",1326
3952,These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all; they’re a couple offrauds—regular dead-beats.,1326
3953,"There, now we’re over the worst of it, youcan stand the rest middling easy.”",1326
3954,"It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoalwater now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higherall the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we firststruck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through towhere she flung herself on to the king’s breast at the front door andhe kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, withher face afire like sunset, and says:",1327
3955,“The brute!,1328
3956,"Come, don’t waste a minute—not a _second_—we’ll have themtarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”",1328
3957,Says I:,1329
3958,“Cert’nly.,1330
3959,"But do you mean _before_ you go to Mr. Lothrop’s, or—”",1330
3960,"“Oh,” she says, “what am I _thinking_ about!” she says, and set rightdown again.",1331
3961,"“Don’t mind what I said—please don’t—you _won’t,_ now,_will_ you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that Isaid I would die first.",1331
3962,"“I never thought, I was so stirred up,” shesays; “now go on, and I won’t do so any more.",1331
3963,"You tell me what to do,and whatever you say I’ll do it.”",1331
3964,"“Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two frauds, and I’m fixed so Igot to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not—Idruther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this townwould get me out of their claws, and _I_’d be all right; but there’d beanother person that you don’t know about who’d be in big trouble.",1332
3965,"Well,we got to save _him_, hain’t we?",1332
3966,Of course.,1332
3967,"Well, then, we won’t blowon them.”",1332
3968,Saying them words put a good idea in my head.,1333
3969,"I see how maybe I couldget me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave.",1333
3970,But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboardto answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan to begin workingtill pretty late to-night.,1333
3971,I says:,1333
3972,"“Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you won’t have tostay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther.",1334
3973,How fur is it?”,1334
3974,"“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here.”",1335
3975,"“Well, that’ll answer.",1336
3976,"Now you go along out there, and lay low tillnine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you homeagain—tell them you’ve thought of something.",1336
3977,"If you get here beforeeleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t turn up wait _till_eleven, and _then_ if I don’t turn up it means I’m gone, and out of theway, and safe.",1336
3978,"Then you come out and spread the news around, and getthese beats jailed.”",1336
3979,"“Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”",1337
3980,"“And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took up alongwith them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand,and you must stand by me all you can.”",1338
3981,“Stand by you!,1339
3982,indeed I will.,1339
3983,"They sha’n’t touch a hair of your head!”she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she saidit, too.",1339
3984,"“If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallionsain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do it if I _was_ here.",1340
3985,"I could swearthey was beats and bummers, that’s all, though that’s worth something.",1340
3986,"Well, there’s others can do that better than what I can, and they’repeople that ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be.",1340
3987,I’ll tell youhow to find them.,1340
3988,Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.,1340
3989,"There—‘_RoyalNonesuch, Bricksville_.’ Put it away, and don’t lose it.",1340
3990,"When the courtwants to find out something about these two, let them send up toBricksville and say they’ve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,and ask for some witnesses—why, you’ll have that entire town down herebefore you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.",1340
3991,"And they’ll come a-biling, too.”",1340
3992,I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.,1341
3993,So I says:,1341
3994,"“Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry.",1342
3995,"Nobody don’thave to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auctionon accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of this tillthey get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale ain’t going tocount, and they ain’t going to _get_ no money.",1342
3996,"It’s just like the wayit was with the niggers—it warn’t no sale, and the niggers will be backbefore long.",1342
3997,"Why, they can’t collect the money for the _niggers_yet—they’re in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”",1342
3998,"“Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now, and then I’ll startstraight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”",1343
3999,"“’Deed, _that_ ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “by no mannerof means; go _before_ breakfast.”",1344
4000,“Why?”,1345
4001,"“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”",1346
4002,"“Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don’t know.",1347
4003,What was it?”,1347
4004,"“Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face people.",1348
4005,I don’twant no better book than what your face is.,1348
4006,A body can set down andread it off like coarse print.,1348
4007,"Do you reckon you can go and face youruncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—”",1348
4008,"“There, there, don’t!",1349
4009,"Yes, I’ll go before breakfast—I’ll be glad to.",1349
4010,And leave my sisters with them?”,1349
4011,“Yes; never mind about them.,1350
4012,They’ve got to stand it yet a while.,1350
4013,Theymight suspicion something if all of you was to go.,1350
4014,"I don’t want you tosee them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor wasto ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.",1350
4015,"No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I’ll fix it with all ofthem.",1350
4016,"I’ll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and sayyou’ve went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change,or to see a friend, and you’ll be back to-night or early in themorning.”",1350
4017,"“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love given tothem.”",1351
4018,"“Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well enough to tell _her_ so—noharm in it.",1352
4019,"It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’sthe little things that smooths people’s roads the most, down herebelow; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t costnothing.",1352
4020,Then I says: “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.”,1352
4021,"“Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think_how_ they got it.”",1353
4022,"“No, you’re out, there.",1354
4023,They hain’t got it.”,1354
4024,"“Why, who’s got it?”",1355
4025,"“I wish I knowed, but I don’t.",1356
4026,"I _had_ it, because I stole it fromthem; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I’mafraid it ain’t there no more.",1356
4027,"I’m awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’mjust as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.",1356
4028,"Icome nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place Icome to, and run—and it warn’t a good place.”",1356
4029,"“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I won’t allowit—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t your fault.",1357
4030,Where did you hide it?”,1357
4031,I didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and Icouldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see thatcorpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.,1358
4032,Sofor a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:,1358
4033,"“I’d ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don’tmind letting me off; but I’ll write it for you on a piece of paper, andyou can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s, if you want to.",1359
4034,Do youreckon that’ll do?”,1359
4035,"“Oh, yes.”",1360
4036,So I wrote: “I put it in the coffin.,1361
4037,"It was in there when you wascrying there, away in the night.",1361
4038,"I was behind the door, and I wasmighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”",1361
4039,"It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all byherself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her ownroof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give itto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by thehand, hard, and says:",1362
4040,“_Good_-bye.,1363
4041,"I’m going to do everything just as you’ve told me; and ifI don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t ever forget you and I’ll think ofyou a many and a many a time, and I’ll _pray_ for you, too!”—and shewas gone.",1363
4042,Pray for me!,1364
4043,I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that was morenearer her size.,1364
4044,"But I bet she done it, just the same—she was just thatkind.",1364
4045,"She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—therewarn’t no back-down to her, I judge.",1364
4046,"You may say what you want to, butin my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in myopinion she was just full of sand.",1364
4047,"It sounds like flattery, but itain’t no flattery.",1364
4048,"And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—shelays over them all.",1364
4049,"I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I seeher go out of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckonI’ve thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of hersaying she would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do anygood for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or bust.",1364
4050,"Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody seeher go.",1365
4051,"When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:",1365
4052,“What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of the river thatyou all goes to see sometimes?”,1366
4053,They says:,1367
4054,"“There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.”",1368
4055,"“That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.",1369
4056,"Well, Miss Mary Jane shetold me to tell you she’s gone over there in a dreadful hurry—one ofthem’s sick.”",1369
4057,“Which one?”,1370
4058,"“I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s—”",1371
4059,"“Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t _Hanner?_”",1372
4060,"“I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s the very one.”",1373
4061,"“My goodness, and she so well only last week!",1374
4062,Is she took bad?”,1374
4063,“It ain’t no name for it.,1375
4064,"They set up with her all night, Miss MaryJane said, and they don’t think she’ll last many hours.”",1375
4065,"“Only think of that, now!",1376
4066,What’s the matter with her?”,1376
4067,"I couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:",1377
4068,“Mumps.”,1378
4069,“Mumps your granny!,1379
4070,They don’t set up with people that’s got themumps.”,1379
4071,"“They don’t, don’t they?",1380
4072,You better bet they do with _these_ mumps.,1380
4073,These mumps is different.,1380
4074,"It’s a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”",1380
4075,“How’s it a new kind?”,1381
4076,“Because it’s mixed up with other things.”,1382
4077,“What other things?”,1383
4078,"“Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, andyaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don’t know what all.”",1384
4079,“My land!,1385
4080,And they call it the _mumps?_”,1385
4081,“That’s what Miss Mary Jane said.”,1386
4082,"“Well, what in the nation do they call it the _mumps_ for?”",1387
4083,"“Why, because it _is_ the mumps.",1388
4084,That’s what it starts with.”,1388
4085,"“Well, ther’ ain’t no sense in it.",1389
4086,"A body might stump his toe, and takepison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brainsout, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskullup and say, ‘Why, he stumped his _toe_.’ Would ther’ be any sense inthat?",1389
4087,_No_.,1389
4088,"And ther’ ain’t no sense in _this_, nuther.",1389
4089,Is itketching?”,1389
4090,"“Is it _ketching?_ Why, how you talk.",1390
4091,Is a _harrow_ catching—in thedark?,1390
4092,"If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re bound to on another,ain’t you?",1390
4093,"And you can’t get away with that tooth without fetching thewhole harrow along, can you?",1390
4094,"Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of aharrow, as you may say—and it ain’t no slouch of a harrow, nuther, youcome to get it hitched on good.”",1390
4095,"“Well, it’s awful, _I_ think,” says the hare-lip.",1391
4096,“I’ll go to UncleHarvey and—”,1391
4097,"“Oh, yes,” I says, “I _would_.",1392
4098,Of _course_ I would.,1392
4099,I wouldn’t lose notime.”,1392
4100,"“Well, why wouldn’t you?”",1393
4101,"“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.",1394
4102,Hain’t your unclesobleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?,1394
4103,And do youreckon they’d be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all thatjourney by yourselves?,1394
4104,_You_ know they’ll wait for you.,1394
4105,"So fur, sogood.",1394
4106,"Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher, ain’t he?",1394
4107,"Very well, then; is a_preacher_ going to deceive a steamboat clerk?",1394
4108,is he going to deceive a_ship clerk?_—so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?,1394
4109,Now_you_ know he ain’t.,1394
4110,"What _will_ he do, then?",1394
4111,"Why, he’ll say, ‘It’s agreat pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best waythey can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unummumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here and wait the threemonths it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ But never mind, if youthink it’s best to tell your uncle Harvey—”",1394
4112,"“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having goodtimes in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’sgot it or not?",1395
4113,"Why, you talk like a muggins.”",1395
4114,"“Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”",1396
4115,"“Listen at that, now.",1397
4116,You do beat all for natural stupidness.,1397
4117,Can’t you_see_ that _they’d_ go and tell?,1397
4118,Ther’ ain’t no way but just to nottell anybody at _all_.”,1397
4119,"“Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you _are_ right.”",1398
4120,"“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a while,anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”",1399
4121,"“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.",1400
4122,"She says, ‘Tell them togive Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I’ve run overthe river to see Mr.’—Mr.—what _is_ the name of that rich family youruncle Peter used to think so much of?—I mean the one that—”",1400
4123,"“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”",1401
4124,"“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem toremember them, half the time, somehow.",1402
4125,"Yes, she said, say she has runover for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buythis house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they hadit than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they saythey’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s coming home; andif she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway.",1402
4126,"She said, don’t saynothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps—which’ll beperfectly true, because she _is_ going there to speak about theirbuying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself.”",1402
4127,"“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, andgive them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.",1403
4128,Everything was all right now.,1404
4129,The girls wouldn’t say nothing becausethey wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would rutherMary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach ofDoctor Robinson.,1404
4130,I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat—Ireckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater himself.,1404
4131,"Of course hewould a throwed more style into it, but I can’t do that very handy, notbeing brung up to it.",1404
4132,"Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the endof the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the oldman he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside ofthe auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or alittle goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was aroundgoo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himselfgenerly.",1405
4133,"But by-and-by the thing dragged through, and everything wassold—everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.",1406
4134,Sothey’d got to work _that_ off—I never see such a girafft as the kingwas for wanting to swallow _everything_.,1406
4135,"Well, whilst they was at it asteamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whoopingand yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:",1406
4136,“_Here’s_ your opposition line!,1407
4137,here’s your two sets o’ heirs to oldPeter Wilks—and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”,1407
4138,CHAPTER XXIX.,1409
4139,"They was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and anice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.",1410
4140,"And, my souls,how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.",1410
4141,"But I didn’t see nojoke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king someto see any.",1410
4142,I reckoned they’d turn pale.,1410
4143,"But no, nary a pale did _they_turn.",1410
4144,"The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but justwent a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that’sgoogling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazeddown sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache inhis very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in theworld.",1410
4145,"Oh, he done it admirable.",1410
4146,"Lots of the principal people getheredaround the king, to let him see they was on his side.",1410
4147,That oldgentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death.,1410
4148,"Pretty soonhe begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced _like_ anEnglishman—not the king’s way, though the king’s _was_ pretty good foran imitation.",1410
4149,"I can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitatehim; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:",1410
4150,"“This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’llacknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it andanswer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke hisarm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in thenight by a mistake.",1411
4151,"I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and this is hisbrother William, which can’t hear nor speak—and can’t even make signsto amount to much, now’t he’s only got one hand to work them with.",1411
4152,"Weare who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, Ican prove it.",1411
4153,"But up till then I won’t say nothing more, but go to thehotel and wait.”",1411
4154,"So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, andblethers out:",1412
4155,"“Broke his arm—_very_ likely, _ain’t_ it?—and very convenient, too, fora fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t learnt how.",1413
4156,Lost theirbaggage!,1413
4157,That’s _mighty_ good!—and mighty ingenious—under the_circumstances!_”,1413
4158,"So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four,or maybe half a dozen.",1414
4159,"One of these was that doctor; another one was asharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kindmade out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat andwas talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king nowand then and nodding their heads—it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that wasgone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that comealong and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening tothe king now.",1414
4160,And when the king got done this husky up and says:,1414
4161,"“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to thistown?”",1415
4162,"“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.",1416
4163,“But what time o’ day?”,1417
4164,“In the evenin’—’bout an hour er two before sundown.”,1418
4165,“_How’d_ you come?”,1419
4166,“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”,1420
4167,"“Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the _mornin_’—in acanoe?”",1421
4168,“I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”,1422
4169,“It’s a lie.”,1423
4170,Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way toan old man and a preacher.,1424
4171,"“Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar.",1425
4172,He was up at the Pintthat mornin’.,1425
4173,"I live up there, don’t I?",1425
4174,"Well, I was up there, and hewas up there.",1425
4175,I _see_ him there.,1425
4176,"He come in a canoe, along with TimCollins and a boy.”",1425
4177,The doctor he up and says:,1426
4178,"“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”",1427
4179,"“I reckon I would, but I don’t know.",1428
4180,"Why, yonder he is, now.",1428
4181,I know himperfectly easy.”,1428
4182,It was me he pointed at.,1429
4183,The doctor says:,1429
4184,"“Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; butif _these_ two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s all.",1430
4185,I think it’sour duty to see that they don’t get away from here till we’ve lookedinto this thing.,1430
4186,"Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.",1430
4187,"We’lltake these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t’other couple,and I reckon we’ll find out _something_ before we get through.”",1430
4188,"It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends; sowe all started.",1431
4189,It was about sundown.,1431
4190,"The doctor he led me along by thehand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let _go_ my hand.",1431
4191,"We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, andfetched in the new couple.",1432
4192,"First, the doctor says:",1432
4193,"“I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but _I_ think they’refrauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know nothing about.",1433
4194,"If they have, won’t the complices get away with that bag of gold PeterWilks left?",1433
4195,It ain’t unlikely.,1433
4196,"If these men ain’t frauds, they won’tobject to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they provethey’re all right—ain’t that so?”",1433
4197,Everybody agreed to that.,1434
4198,So I judged they had our gang in a prettytight place right at the outstart.,1434
4199,"But the king he only lookedsorrowful, and says:",1434
4200,"“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no dispositionto throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigationo’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t there; you k’nsend and see, if you want to.”",1435
4201,"“Where is it, then?”",1436
4202,"“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid itinside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank it for the fewdays we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a safe place, we not bein’used to niggers, and suppos’n’ ’em honest, like servants in England.",1437
4203,"The niggers stole it the very next mornin’ after I had went downstairs; and when I sold ’em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they gotclean away with it.",1437
4204,"My servant here k’n tell you ’bout it, gentlemen.”",1437
4205,The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’taltogether believe him.,1438
4206,One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.,1438
4207,"I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away,and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they hadwaked up my master and was trying to get away before he made troublewith them.",1438
4208,That was all they asked me.,1438
4209,Then the doctor whirls on me andsays:,1438
4210,"“Are _you_ English, too?”",1439
4211,"I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”",1440
4212,"Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there wehad it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a wordabout supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up,and kept it up; and it _was_ the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.",1441
4213,"They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tellhis’n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a _seen_that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t’other one lies.",1441
4214,Andby-and-by they had me up to tell what I knowed.,1441
4215,"The king he give me aleft-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enoughto talk on the right side.",1441
4216,"I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how welived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn’tget pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, thelawyer, says:",1441
4217,"“Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you.",1442
4218,"I reckon youain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come handy; what you want ispractice.",1442
4219,You do it pretty awkward.”,1442
4220,"I didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,anyway.",1443
4221,"The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:",1444
4222,"“If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell—” The king broke in andreached out his hand, and says:",1445
4223,"“Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s wrote sooften about?”",1446
4224,"The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and lookedpleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one sideand talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:",1447
4225,“That’ll fix it.,1448
4226,"I’ll take the order and send it, along with yourbrother’s, and then they’ll know it’s all right.”",1448
4227,"So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twistedhis head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled offsomething; and then they give the pen to the duke—and then for thefirst time the duke looked sick.",1449
4228,But he took the pen and wrote.,1449
4229,So thenthe lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:,1449
4230,“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”,1450
4231,"The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it.",1451
4232,"The lawyer lookedpowerful astonished, and says:",1451
4233,"“Well, it beats _me_”—and snaked a lot of old letters out of hispocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man’s writing, andthen _them_ again; and then says: “These old letters is from HarveyWilks; and here’s _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see _they_didn’t write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, Itell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here’s _this_old gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_didn’t write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t properly_writing_ at all.",1452
4234,"Now, here’s some letters from—”",1452
4235,The new old gentleman says:,1453
4236,"“If you please, let me explain.",1454
4237,Nobody can read my hand but my brotherthere—so he copies for me.,1454
4238,"It’s _his_ hand you’ve got there, not mine.”",1454
4239,"“_Well!_” says the lawyer, “this _is_ a state of things.",1455
4240,"I’ve got someof William’s letters, too; so if you’ll get him to write a line or sowe can com—”",1455
4241,"“He _can’t_ write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman.",1456
4242,"“If hecould use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own lettersand mine too.",1456
4243,"Look at both, please—they’re by the same hand.”",1456
4244,"The lawyer done it, and says:",1457
4245,"“I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so, there’s a heap strongerresemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway.",1458
4246,"Well, well, well!",1458
4247,"Ithought we was right on the track of a solution, but it’s gone tograss, partly.",1458
4248,"But anyway, _one_ thing is proved—_these_ two ain’teither of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagged his head towards the king and theduke.",1458
4249,"Well, what do you think?",1459
4250,That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t give in_then!_ Indeed he wouldn’t.,1459
4251,Said it warn’t no fair test.,1459
4252,"Said hisbrother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn’t_tried_ to write—_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokesthe minute he put the pen to paper.",1459
4253,"And so he warmed up and wentwarbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning tobelieve what he was saying _himself;_ but pretty soon the new gentlemanbroke in, and says:",1459
4254,“I’ve thought of something.,1460
4255,Is there anybody here that helped to layout my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”,1460
4256,"“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it.",1461
4257,We’re both here.”,1461
4258,"Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:",1462
4259,“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”,1463
4260,"Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d asqushed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it tookhim so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated tomake most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as thatwithout any notice, because how was _he_ going to know what wastattooed on the man?",1464
4261,"He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and itwas mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards andgazing at him.",1464
4262,"Says I to myself, _Now_ he’ll throw up the sponge—thereain’t no more use.",1464
4263,"Well, did he?",1464
4264,"A body can’t hardly believe it, but hedidn’t.",1464
4265,"I reckon he thought he’d keep the thing up till he tired thempeople out, so they’d thin out, and him and the duke could break looseand get away.",1464
4266,"Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile,and says:",1464
4267,“Mf!,1465
4268,"It’s a _very_ tough question, _ain’t_ it!",1465
4269,"_Yes_, sir, I k’n tellyou what’s tattooed on his breast.",1465
4270,"It’s jest a small, thin, bluearrow—that’s what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it.",1465
4271,_Now_ what do you say—hey?”,1465
4272,"Well, _I_ never see anything like that old blister for cleanout-and-out cheek.",1466
4273,"The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, andhis eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king _this_ time, andsays:",1467
4274,“There—you’ve heard what he said!,1468
4275,Was there any such mark on PeterWilks’ breast?”,1468
4276,Both of them spoke up and says:,1469
4277,“We didn’t see no such mark.”,1470
4278,“Good!” says the old gentleman.,1471
4279,"“Now, what you _did_ see on his breastwas a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he wasyoung), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and he markedthem that way on a piece of paper.",1471
4280,"“Come, ain’t that what you saw?”",1471
4281,"Both of them spoke up again, and says:",1472
4282,"“No, we _didn’t_.",1473
4283,We never seen any marks at all.”,1473
4284,"Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:",1474
4285,“The whole _bilin_’ of ’m ’s frauds!,1475
4286,Le’s duck ’em!,1475
4287,le’s drown ’em!,1475
4288,"le’s ride ’em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and therewas a rattling powwow.",1475
4289,"But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,and says:",1475
4290,“Gentlemen—gentle_men!_ Hear me just a word—just a _single_ word—if youPLEASE!,1476
4291,There’s one way yet—let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”,1476
4292,That took them.,1477
4293,"“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyerand the doctor sung out:",1478
4294,"“Hold on, hold on!",1479
4295,"Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch_them_ along, too!”",1479
4296,“We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t find them marks we’lllynch the whole gang!”,1480
4297,"I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.",1481
4298,"But there warn’t no getting away, youknow.",1481
4299,"They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for thegraveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the wholetown at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine inthe evening.",1481
4300,"As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of town;because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and save me,and blow on our dead-beats.",1482
4301,"Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on likewildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and thelightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongstthe leaves.",1483
4302,"This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I everwas in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so differentfrom what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take myown time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at myback to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here wasnothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just themtattoo-marks.",1483
4303,If they didn’t find them—,1483
4304,"I couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t thinkabout nothing else.",1484
4305,"It got darker and darker, and it was a beautifultime to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by thewrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.",1484
4306,"Hedragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.",1484
4307,When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over itlike an overflow.,1485
4308,"And when they got to the grave they found they hadabout a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’tthought to fetch a lantern.",1485
4309,"But they sailed into digging anyway by theflicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half amile off, to borrow one.",1485
4310,"So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and therain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightningcome brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people nevertook no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minuteyou could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and theshovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second thedark wiped it all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.",1486
4311,"At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and thensuch another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, toscrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way,it was awful.",1487
4312,"Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so,and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited andpanting.",1487
4313,"All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare,and somebody sings out:",1488
4314,"“By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”",1489
4315,"Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist andgive a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I litout and shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.",1490
4316,"I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it allto myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and thebuzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splittingof the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!",1491
4317,"When I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm, so Inever hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through themain one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye andset it.",1492
4318,"No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry anddisappointed, I didn’t know why.",1492
4319,"But at last, just as I was sailing by,_flash_ comes the light in Mary Jane’s window!",1492
4320,"and my heart swelled upsudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behindme in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be before me no more in thisworld.",1492
4321,"She _was_ the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.",1492
4322,"The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make thetow-head, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first timethe lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it andshoved.",1493
4323,"It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope.",1493
4324,"The tow-head was a rattling big distance off, away out there in themiddle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck theraft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gaspif I could afforded it.",1493
4325,But I didn’t.,1493
4326,As I sprung aboard I sung out:,1493
4327,"“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!",1494
4328,"Glory be to goodness, we’re shutof them!”",1494
4329,"Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was sofull of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot upin my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was oldKing Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared thelivers and lights out of me.",1495
4330,"But Jim fished me out, and was going tohug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we wasshut of the king and the duke, but I says:",1495
4331,"“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!",1496
4332,Cut loose andlet her slide!”,1496
4333,"So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it _did_seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river,and nobody to bother us.",1497
4334,"I had to skip around a bit, and jump up andcrack my heels a few times—I couldn’t help it; but about the thirdcrack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breathand listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash bustedout over the water, here they come!—and just a-laying to their oars andmaking their skiff hum!",1497
4335,It was the king and the duke.,1497
4336,"So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it wasall I could do to keep from crying.",1498
4337,CHAPTER XXX.,1500
4338,"When they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,and says:",1501
4339,"“Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!",1502
4340,"Tired of our company,hey?”",1502
4341,I says:,1503
4342,"“No, your majesty, we warn’t—_please_ don’t, your majesty!”",1504
4343,"“Quick, then, and tell us what _was_ your idea, or I’ll shake theinsides out o’ you!”",1505
4344,"“Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.",1506
4345,"The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying hehad a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry tosee a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took bysurprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he letsgo of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ and Ilit out.",1506
4346,"It didn’t seem no good for _me_ to stay—_I_ couldn’t donothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could get away.",1506
4347,"So I neverstopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jimto hurry, or they’d catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard youand the duke wasn’t alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim,and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if Ididn’t.”",1506
4348,"Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,yes, it’s _mighty_ likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckonedhe’d drownd me.",1507
4349,But the duke says:,1507
4350,"“Leggo the boy, you old idiot!",1508
4351,Would _you_ a done any different?,1508
4352,Didyou inquire around for _him_ when you got loose?,1508
4353,_I_ don’t rememberit.”,1508
4354,"So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody init.",1509
4355,But the duke says:,1509
4356,"“You better a blame sight give _yourself_ a good cussing, for you’rethe one that’s entitled to it most.",1510
4357,"You hain’t done a thing from thestart that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheekywith that imaginary blue-arrow mark.",1510
4358,That _was_ bright—it was rightdown bully; and it was the thing that saved us.,1510
4359,"For if it hadn’t beenfor that, they’d a jailed us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—andthen—the penitentiary, you bet!",1510
4360,"But that trick took ’em to thegraveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if theexcited fools hadn’t let go all holts and made that rush to get a look,we’d a slept in our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to _wear_,too—longer than _we’d_ need ’em.”",1510
4361,"They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind ofabsent-minded like:",1511
4362,“Mf!,1512
4363,And we reckoned the _niggers_ stole it!”,1512
4364,That made me squirm!,1513
4365,"“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “_We_did.”",1514
4366,After about a half a minute the king drawls out:,1515
4367,"“Leastways, _I_ did.”",1516
4368,"The duke says, the same way:",1517
4369,"“On the contrary, _I_ did.”",1518
4370,"The king kind of ruffles up, and says:",1519
4371,"“Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”",1520
4372,"The duke says, pretty brisk:",1521
4373,"“When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was _you_referring to?”",1522
4374,"“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but _I_ don’t know—maybe youwas asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”",1523
4375,"The duke bristles up now, and says:",1524
4376,"“Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame’fool?",1525
4377,Don’t you reckon _I_ know who hid that money in that coffin?”,1525
4378,"“_Yes_, sir!",1526
4379,"I know you _do_ know, because you done it yourself!”",1526
4380,“It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him.,1527
4381,The king sings out:,1527
4382,“Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it all back!”,1528
4383,The duke says:,1529
4384,"“Well, you just own up, first, that you _did_ hide that money there,intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and digit up, and have it all to yourself.”",1530
4385,"“Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest and fair;if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll b’lieve you, andtake back everything I said.”",1531
4386,"“You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.",1532
4387,"There, now!”",1532
4388,"“Well, then, I b’lieve you.",1533
4389,But answer me only jest this one more—now_don’t_ git mad; didn’t you have it in your mind to hook the money andhide it?”,1533
4390,The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:,1534
4391,"“Well, I don’t care if I _did_, I didn’t _do_ it, anyway.",1535
4392,"But you notonly had it in mind to do it, but you _done_ it.”",1535
4393,"“I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.",1536
4394,"I won’t sayI warn’t _goin_’ to do it, because I _was;_ but you—I mean somebody—gotin ahead o’ me.”",1536
4395,“It’s a lie!,1537
4396,"You done it, and you got to _say_ you done it, or—”",1537
4397,"The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:",1538
4398,“’Nough!—_I own up!_”,1539
4399,I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easierthan what I was feeling before.,1540
4400,So the duke took his hands off andsays:,1540
4401,“If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.,1541
4402,"It’s _well_ for you to setthere and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for you, after the way you’veacted.",1541
4403,"I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobbleeverything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my ownfather.",1541
4404,"You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear itsaddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for ’em.",1541
4405,It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_that rubbage.,1541
4406,"Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make upthe deffisit—you wanted to get what money I’d got out of the Nonesuchand one thing or another, and scoop it _all!_”",1541
4407,"The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:",1542
4408,"“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t me.”",1543
4409,“Dry up!,1544
4410,I don’t want to hear no more _out_ of you!” says the duke.,1544
4411,“And _now_ you see what you _got_ by it.,1544
4412,"They’ve got all their ownmoney back, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_.",1544
4413,"G’long tobed, and don’t you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long ’s _you_live!”",1544
4414,"So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,and before long the duke tackled _his_ bottle; and so in about a halfan hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got,the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.",1545
4415,"They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t get mellowenough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bagagain.",1545
4416,That made me feel easy and satisfied.,1545
4417,"Of course when they got tosnoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.",1545
4418,CHAPTER XXXI.,1547
4419,We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right alongdown the river.,1548
4420,"We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mightylong ways from home.",1548
4421,"We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss onthem, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.",1548
4422,"It was thefirst I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn anddismal.",1548
4423,"So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and theybegun to work the villages again.",1548
4424,First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enoughfor them both to get drunk on.,1549
4425,Then in another village they started adancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than akangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumpedin and pranced them out of town.,1549
4426,"Another time they tried to go atyellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got upand give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out.",1549
4427,"Theytackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and tellingfortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have noluck.",1549
4428,"So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around theraft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never sayingnothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.",1549
4429,And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together inthe wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.,1550
4430,Jim and me got uneasy.,1550
4431,We didn’t like the look of it.,1550
4432,We judged theywas studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.,1550
4433,"We turned itover and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to breakinto somebody’s house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-moneybusiness, or something.",1550
4434,"So then we was pretty scared, and made up anagreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world to do with suchactions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the coldshake and clear out and leave them behind.",1550
4435,"Well, early one morning wehid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit ofa shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and toldus all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see ifanybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.",1550
4436,"(“House torob, you _mean_,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbingit you’ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim andthe raft—and you’ll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said ifhe warn’t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right,and we was to come along.",1550
4437,So we stayed where we was.,1551
4438,"The duke he fretted and sweated around, andwas in a mighty sour way.",1551
4439,"He scolded us for everything, and we couldn’tseem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.",1551
4440,"Something was a-brewing, sure.",1551
4441,"I was good and glad when midday come andno king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for _the_change on top of it.",1551
4442,"So me and the duke went up to the village, andhunted around there for the king, and by-and-by we found him in theback room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafersbullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with allhis might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t do nothing tothem.",1551
4443,"The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the kingbegun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out andshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road likea deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be along day before they ever see me and Jim again.",1551
4444,"I got down there allout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:",1551
4445,"“Set her loose, Jim!",1552
4446,we’re all right now!”,1552
4447,"But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.",1553
4448,Jim wasgone!,1553
4449,"I set up a shout—and then another—and then another one; and runthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn’tno use—old Jim was gone.",1553
4450,Then I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it.,1553
4451,But I couldn’t set still long.,1553
4452,"Pretty soon I went out on the road,trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, andasked him if he’d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:",1553
4453,“Yes.”,1554
4454,“Whereabouts?” says I.,1555
4455,"“Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here.",1556
4456,"He’s a runawaynigger, and they’ve got him.",1556
4457,Was you looking for him?”,1556
4458,“You bet I ain’t!,1557
4459,"I run across him in the woods about an hour or twoago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out—and told me tolay down and stay where I was; and I done it.",1557
4460,Been there ever since;afeard to come out.”,1557
4461,"“Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more, becuz they’ve got him.",1558
4462,"He run off f’m down South, som’ers.”",1558
4463,“It’s a good job they got him.”,1559
4464,"“Well, I _reckon!_ There’s two hunderd dollars reward on him.",1560
4465,It’s likepicking up money out’n the road.”,1560
4466,"“Yes, it is—and _I_ could a had it if I’d been big enough; I see him_first_.",1561
4467,Who nailed him?”,1561
4468,"“It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his chance in him forforty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river and can’t wait.",1562
4469,"Thinko’ that, now!",1562
4470,"You bet _I’d_ wait, if it was seven year.”",1562
4471,"“That’s me, every time,” says I.",1563
4472,"“But maybe his chance ain’t worth nomore than that, if he’ll sell it so cheap.",1563
4473,Maybe there’s somethingain’t straight about it.”,1563
4474,"“But it _is_, though—straight as a string.",1564
4475,I see the handbill myself.,1564
4476,"It tells all about him, to a dot—paints him like a picture, and tellsthe plantation he’s frum, below Newr_leans_.",1564
4477,"No-sirree-_bob_, theyain’t no trouble ’bout _that_ speculation, you bet you.",1564
4478,"Say, gimme achaw tobacker, won’t ye?”",1564
4479,"I didn’t have none, so he left.",1565
4480,"I went to the raft, and set down in thewigwam to think.",1565
4481,But I couldn’t come to nothing.,1565
4482,"I thought till I woremy head sore, but I couldn’t see no way out of the trouble.",1565
4483,"After allthis long journey, and after all we’d done for them scoundrels, here itwas all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, becausethey could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and makehim a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for fortydirty dollars.",1565
4484,"Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to bea slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d _got_ to be aslave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him totell Miss Watson where he was.",1566
4485,"But I soon give up that notion for twothings: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulnessfor leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down the river again;and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he’d feel ornery anddisgraced.",1566
4486,And then think of _me!_ It would get all around that HuckFinn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to seeanybody from that town again I’d be ready to get down and lick hisboots for shame.,1566
4487,"That’s just the way: a person does a low-down thing,and then he don’t want to take no consequences of it.",1566
4488,"Thinks as long ashe can hide it, it ain’t no disgrace.",1566
4489,That was my fix exactly.,1566
4490,"The moreI studied about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, andthe more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling.",1566
4491,"And at last,when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand ofProvidence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickednesswas being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I wasstealing a poor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t ever done me no harm,and now was showing me there’s One that’s always on the lookout, andain’t a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so furand no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.",1566
4492,"Well, Itried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself bysaying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn’t so much to blame; butsomething inside of me kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, youcould a gone to it; and if you’d a done it they’d a learnt you therethat people that acts as I’d been acting about that nigger goes toeverlasting fire.”",1566
4493,It made me shiver.,1567
4494,"And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if Icouldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.",1567
4495,So Ikneeled down.,1567
4496,But the words wouldn’t come.,1567
4497,Why wouldn’t they?,1567
4498,It warn’tno use to try and hide it from Him.,1567
4499,"Nor from _me_, neither.",1567
4500,I knowedvery well why they wouldn’t come.,1567
4501,It was because my heart warn’t right;it was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing double.,1567
4502,"Iwas letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding onto the biggest one of all.",1567
4503,"I was trying to make my mouth _say_ I woulddo the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to thatnigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed itwas a lie, and He knowed it.",1567
4504,You can’t pray a lie—I found that out.,1567
4505,"So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what todo.",1568
4506,"At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the letter—and_then_ see if I can pray.",1568
4507,"Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt aslight as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.",1568
4508,"So Igot a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set downand wrote:",1568
4509,"Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile belowPikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for thereward if you send.",1569
4510,_Huck Finn._,1570
4511,"I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had everfelt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.",1571
4512,"But I didn’t do itstraight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinkinghow good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lostand going to hell.",1571
4513,And went on thinking.,1571
4514,"And got to thinking over ourtrip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the dayand in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and wea-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.",1571
4515,"But somehow Icouldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but onlythe other kind.",1571
4516,"I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n, ’steadof calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he waswhen I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in theswamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and wouldalways call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think offor me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time Isaved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was sograteful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world,and the _only_ one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around andsee that paper.",1571
4517,It was a close place.,1572
4518,"I took it up, and held it in my hand.",1572
4519,"I wasa-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,and I knowed it.",1572
4520,"I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, andthen says to myself:",1572
4521,"“All right, then, I’ll _go_ to hell”—and tore it up.",1573
4522,"It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.",1574
4523,And I letthem stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.,1574
4524,"I shoved thewhole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.",1574
4525,"Andfor a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; becauseas long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.",1574
4526,"Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over someconsiderable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan thatsuited me.",1575
4527,"So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was downthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out withmy raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.",1575
4528,"I sleptthe night through, and got up before it was light, and had mybreakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and onething or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.",1575
4529,"I landed below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle inthe woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocksinto her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her,about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on thebank.",1575
4530,"Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign onit, “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses, two orthree hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’tsee nobody around, though it was good daylight now.",1576
4531,"But I didn’t mind,because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get thelay of the land.",1576
4532,"According to my plan, I was going to turn up therefrom the village, not from below.",1576
4533,"So I just took a look, and shovedalong, straight for town.",1576
4534,"Well, the very first man I see when I gotthere was the duke.",1576
4535,He was sticking up a bill for the RoyalNonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time.,1576
4536,"_They_ had thecheek, them frauds!",1576
4537,I was right on him before I could shirk.,1576
4538,"He lookedastonished, and says:",1576
4539,"“Hel-_lo!_ Where’d _you_ come from?” Then he says, kind of glad andeager, “Where’s the raft?—got her in a good place?”",1577
4540,I says:,1578
4541,"“Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”",1579
4542,"Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:",1580
4543,“What was your idea for asking _me?_” he says.,1581
4544,"“Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I saysto myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s soberer; so Iwent a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.",1582
4545,"A man up andoffered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and backto fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him tothe boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him toshove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, andwe after him.",1582
4546,"We didn’t have no dog, and so we had to chase him allover the country till we tired him out.",1582
4547,"We never got him till dark;then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.",1582
4548,"When I gotthere and see it was gone, I says to myself, ‘they’ve got into troubleand had to leave; and they’ve took my nigger, which is the only niggerI’ve got in the world, and now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t gotno property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so Iset down and cried.",1582
4549,I slept in the woods all night.,1582
4550,"But what _did_become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!”",1582
4551,"“Blamed if _I_ know—that is, what’s become of the raft.",1583
4552,"That old foolhad made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in thedoggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got everycent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late lastnight and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little rascal has stoleour raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’”",1583
4553,"“I wouldn’t shake my _nigger_, would I?—the only nigger I had in theworld, and the only property.”",1584
4554,“We never thought of that.,1585
4555,"Fact is, I reckon we’d come to consider him_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had troubleenough for him.",1585
4556,"So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,there warn’t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch anothershake.",1585
4557,"And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.",1585
4558,Where’sthat ten cents?,1585
4559,Give it here.”,1585
4560,"I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him tospend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all themoney I had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday.",1586
4561,He neversaid nothing.,1586
4562,The next minute he whirls on me and says:,1586
4563,“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?,1587
4564,We’d skin him if he donethat!”,1587
4565,“How can he blow?,1588
4566,Hain’t he run off?”,1588
4567,“No!,1589
4568,"That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money’sgone.”",1589
4569,"“_Sold_ him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why, he was _my_ nigger, andthat was my money.",1590
4570,Where is he?—I want my nigger.”,1590
4571,"“Well, you can’t _get_ your nigger, that’s all—so dry up yourblubbering.",1591
4572,Looky here—do you think _you’d_ venture to blow on us?,1591
4573,Blamed if I think I’d trust you.,1591
4574,"Why, if you _was_ to blow on us—”",1591
4575,"He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyesbefore.",1592
4576,"I went on a-whimpering, and says:",1592
4577,"“I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time to blow,nohow.",1593
4578,I got to turn out and find my nigger.”,1593
4579,"He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering onhis arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.",1594
4580,At last he says:,1594
4581,“I’ll tell you something.,1595
4582,We got to be here three days.,1595
4583,"If you’llpromise you won’t blow, and won’t let the nigger blow, I’ll tell youwhere to find him.”",1595
4584,"So I promised, and he says:",1596
4585,“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped.,1597
4586,"You see, hestarted to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begunto study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.",1597
4587,And sohe was.,1597
4588,He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me outof the way the whole three days.,1597
4589,So pretty soon he says:,1597
4590,"“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and helives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”",1598
4591,"“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.",1599
4592,And I’ll start thisvery afternoon.”,1599
4593,"“No you wont, you’ll start _now;_ and don’t you lose any time about it,neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.",1600
4594,"Just keep a tight tongue inyour head and move right along, and then you won’t get into troublewith _us_, d’ye hear?”",1600
4595,"That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.",1601
4596,Iwanted to be left free to work my plans.,1601
4597,"“So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you wantto.",1602
4598,Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your nigger—someidiots don’t require documents—leastways I’ve heard there’s such downSouth here.,1602
4599,"And when you tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus,maybe he’ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was forgetting ’em out.",1602
4600,"Go ’long now, and tell him anything you want to; butmind you don’t work your jaw any _between_ here and there.”",1602
4601,"So I left, and struck for the back country.",1603
4602,"I didn’t look around, but Ikinder felt like he was watching me.",1603
4603,But I knowed I could tire him outat that.,1603
4604,I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before Istopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps’.,1603
4605,"Ireckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without foolingaround, because I wanted to stop Jim’s mouth till these fellows couldget away.",1603
4606,I didn’t want no trouble with their kind.,1603
4607,"I’d seen all Iwanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.",1603
4608,CHAPTER XXXII.,1605
4609,"When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot andsunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind offaint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem solonesome and like everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans alongand quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feellike it’s spirits whispering—spirits that’s been dead ever so manyyears—and you always think they’re talking about _you_.",1606
4610,"As a generalthing it makes a body wish _he_ was dead, too, and done with it all.",1606
4611,"Phelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and theyall look alike.",1607
4612,"A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out oflogs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a differentlength, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand onwhen they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches inthe big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat withthe nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewedlogs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and thesemud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen,with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; logsmoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in arow t’other side the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself awaydown against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece theother side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the littlehut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; houndasleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about; about threeshade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberrybushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and awatermelon patch; then the cotton fields begins, and after the fieldsthe woods.",1607
4613,"I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, andstarted for the kitchen.",1608
4614,When I got a little ways I heard the dim humof a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; andthen I knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that _is_ thelonesomest sound in the whole world.,1608
4615,"I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but justtrusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the timecome; for I’d noticed that Providence always did put the right words inmy mouth if I left it alone.",1609
4616,"When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and wentfor me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.",1610
4617,Andsuch another powwow as they made!,1610
4618,"In a quarter of a minute I was a kindof a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle offifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and nosesstretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; youcould see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.",1610
4619,"A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin inher hand, singing out, “Begone _you_ Tige!",1611
4620,you Spot!,1611
4621,"begone sah!” andshe fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent themhowling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of themcome back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.",1611
4622,"There ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow.",1611
4623,"And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little niggerboys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on totheir mother’s gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, theway they always do.",1612
4624,"And here comes the white woman running from thehouse, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and herspinning-stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little whitechildren, acting the same way the little niggers was doing.",1612
4625,She wassmiling all over so she could hardly stand—and says:,1612
4626,"“It’s _you_, at last!—_ain’t_ it?”",1613
4627,I out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.,1614
4628,"She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both handsand shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over;and she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “Youdon’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but lawsakes, I don’t care for that, I’m _so_ glad to see you!",1615
4629,"Dear, dear, itdoes seem like I could eat you up!",1615
4630,"Children, it’s your cousin Tom!—tellhim howdy.”",1615
4631,"But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, andhid behind her.",1616
4632,So she run on:,1616
4633,"“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you getyour breakfast on the boat?”",1617
4634,I said I had got it on the boat.,1618
4635,"So then she started for the house,leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.",1618
4636,"When we gotthere she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself downon a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, andsays:",1618
4637,"“Now I can have a _good_ look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve been hungryfor it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s come atlast!",1619
4638,We been expecting you a couple of days and more.,1619
4639,What kep’you?—boat get aground?”,1619
4640,“Yes’m—she—”,1620
4641,“Don’t say yes’m—say Aunt Sally.,1621
4642,Where’d she get aground?”,1621
4643,"I didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know whether theboat would be coming up the river or down.",1622
4644,But I go a good deal oninstinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down towardsOrleans.,1622
4645,"That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t know the namesof bars down that way.",1622
4646,"I see I’d got to invent a bar, or forget thename of the one we got aground on—or—Now I struck an idea, and fetchedit out:",1622
4647,“It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back but a little.,1623
4648,Weblowed out a cylinder-head.”,1623
4649,“Good gracious!,1624
4650,anybody hurt?”,1624
4651,“No’m.,1625
4652,Killed a nigger.”,1625
4653,"“Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.",1626
4654,"Two years agolast Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old_Lally Rook_, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.",1626
4655,And I think he died afterwards.,1626
4656,He was a Baptist.,1626
4657,Your uncle Silasknowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.,1626
4658,"Yes, Iremember now, he _did_ die.",1626
4659,"Mortification set in, and they had toamputate him.",1626
4660,But it didn’t save him.,1626
4661,"Yes, it was mortification—thatwas it.",1626
4662,"He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a gloriousresurrection.",1626
4663,They say he was a sight to look at.,1626
4664,Your uncle’s been upto the town every day to fetch you.,1626
4665,"And he’s gone again, not more’n anhour ago; he’ll be back any minute now.",1626
4666,"You must a met him on the road,didn’t you?—oldish man, with a—”",1626
4667,"“No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally.",1627
4668,"The boat landed just at daylight,and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around thetown and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not gethere too soon; and so I come down the back way.”",1627
4669,“Who’d you give the baggage to?”,1628
4670,“Nobody.”,1629
4671,"“Why, child, it’ll be stole!”",1630
4672,"“Not where _I_ hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.",1631
4673,“How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”,1632
4674,"It was kinder thin ice, but I says:",1633
4675,"“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better havesomething to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas tothe officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”",1634
4676,I was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good.,1635
4677,"I had my mind on thechildren all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pumpthem a little, and find out who I was.",1635
4678,"But I couldn’t get no show, Mrs.Phelps kept it up and run on so.",1635
4679,"Pretty soon she made the cold chillsstreak all down my back, because she says:",1635
4680,"“But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t told me a wordabout Sis, nor any of them.",1636
4681,"Now I’ll rest my works a little, and youstart up yourn; just tell me _everything_—tell me all about ’m allevery one of ’m; and how they are, and what they’re doing, and whatthey told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”",1636
4682,"Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good.",1637
4683,"Providence had stood by methis fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.",1637
4684,I see itwarn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead—I’d _got_ to throw up my hand.,1637
4685,"So I says to myself, here’s another place where I got to resk thetruth.",1637
4686,"I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me inbehind the bed, and says:",1637
4687,“Here he comes!,1638
4688,"Stick your head down lower—there, that’ll do; you can’tbe seen now.",1638
4689,Don’t you let on you’re here.,1638
4690,I’ll play a joke on him.,1638
4691,"Children, don’t you say a word.”",1638
4692,I see I was in a fix now.,1639
4693,"But it warn’t no use to worry; there warn’tnothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand fromunder when the lightning struck.",1639
4694,I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in;then the bed hid him.,1640
4695,"Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:",1640
4696,“Has he come?”,1641
4697,"“No,” says her husband.",1642
4698,"“Good-_ness_ gracious!” she says, “what in the warld can have become ofhim?”",1643
4699,"“I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I must say it makes medreadful uneasy.”",1644
4700,“Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted!,1645
4701,He _must_ a come; andyou’ve missed him along the road.,1645
4702,I _know_ it’s so—something tells meso.”,1645
4703,"“Why, Sally, I _couldn’t_ miss him along the road—_you_ know that.”",1646
4704,"“But oh, dear, dear, what _will_ Sis say!",1647
4705,He must a come!,1647
4706,You must amissed him.,1647
4707,He—”,1647
4708,"“Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already distressed.",1648
4709,I don’t knowwhat in the world to make of it.,1648
4710,"I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mindacknowledging ’t I’m right down scared.",1648
4711,But there’s no hope that he’scome; for he _couldn’t_ come and me miss him.,1648
4712,"Sally, it’s terrible—justterrible—something’s happened to the boat, sure!”",1648
4713,"“Why, Silas!",1649
4714,Look yonder!—up the road!—ain’t that somebody coming?”,1649
4715,"He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs.Phelps the chance she wanted.",1650
4716,"She stooped down quick at the foot of thebed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back fromthe window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire,and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.",1650
4717,"The old gentlemanstared, and says:",1650
4718,"“Why, who’s that?”",1651
4719,“Who do you reckon ’t is?”,1652
4720,“I hain’t no idea.,1653
4721,Who _is_ it?”,1653
4722,“It’s _Tom Sawyer!_”,1654
4723,"By jings, I most slumped through the floor!",1655
4724,"But there warn’t no time toswap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept onshaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh andcry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,and the rest of the tribe.",1655
4725,"But if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it waslike being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.",1656
4726,"Well, theyfroze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired itcouldn’t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—Imean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.",1656
4727,"And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at themouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it.",1656
4728,"Which wasall right, and worked first-rate; because _they_ didn’t know but whatit would take three days to fix it.",1656
4729,If I’d a called it a bolthead itwould a done just as well.,1656
4730,"Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and prettyuncomfortable all up the other.",1657
4731,"Being Tom Sawyer was easy andcomfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by-and-by I hear asteamboat coughing along down the river.",1657
4732,"Then I says to myself, s’poseTom Sawyer comes down on that boat?",1657
4733,"And s’pose he steps in here anyminute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keepquiet?",1657
4734,"Well, I couldn’t _have_ it that way; it wouldn’t do at all.",1657
4735,Imust go up the road and waylay him.,1657
4736,So I told the folks I reckoned Iwould go up to the town and fetch down my baggage.,1657
4737,"The old gentlemanwas for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horsemyself, and I druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about me.",1657
4738,CHAPTER XXXIII.,1659
4739,"So I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see awagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped andwaited till he come along.",1660
4740,"I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside,and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowedtwo or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat, and thensays:",1660
4741,“I hain’t ever done you no harm.,1661
4742,You know that.,1661
4743,"So, then, what you wantto come back and ha’nt _me_ for?”",1661
4744,I says:,1662
4745,“I hain’t come back—I hain’t been _gone_.”,1663
4746,"When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quitesatisfied yet.",1664
4747,He says:,1664
4748,"“Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on you.",1665
4749,"Honest injunnow, you ain’t a ghost?”",1665
4750,"“Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says.",1666
4751,"“Well—I—I—well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can’t somehowseem to understand it no way.",1667
4752,"Looky here, warn’t you ever murdered _atall?_”",1667
4753,“No.,1668
4754,I warn’t ever murdered at all—I played it on them.,1668
4755,You come inhere and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”,1668
4756,So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see meagain he didn’t know what to do.,1669
4757,"And he wanted to know all about itright off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so ithit him where he lived.",1669
4758,"But I said, leave it alone till by-and-by; andtold his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I toldhim the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?",1669
4759,"Hesaid, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him.",1669
4760,"So he thought andthought, and pretty soon he says:",1669
4761,“It’s all right; I’ve got it.,1670
4762,"Take my trunk in your wagon, and let onit’s your’n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to thehouse about the time you ought to; and I’ll go towards town a piece,and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour afteryou; and you needn’t let on to know me at first.”",1670
4763,I says:,1671
4764,“All right; but wait a minute.,1672
4765,There’s one more thing—a thing that_nobody_ don’t know but me.,1672
4766,"And that is, there’s a nigger here that I’ma-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is _Jim_—old MissWatson’s Jim.”",1672
4767,He says:,1673
4768,“What!,1674
4769,"Why, Jim is—”",1674
4770,He stopped and went to studying.,1675
4771,I says:,1675
4772,“_I_ know what you’ll say.,1676
4773,"You’ll say it’s dirty, low-down business;but what if it is?",1676
4774,"_I_’m low down; and I’m a-going to steal him, and Iwant you keep mum and not let on.",1676
4775,Will you?”,1676
4776,"His eye lit up, and he says:",1677
4777,“I’ll _help_ you steal him!”,1678
4778,"Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.",1679
4779,It was the mostastonishing speech I ever heard—and I’m bound to say Tom Sawyer fellconsiderable in my estimation.,1679
4780,Only I couldn’t believe it.,1679
4781,Tom Sawyer a_nigger stealer!_,1679
4782,"“Oh, shucks!” I says; “you’re joking.”",1680
4783,"“I ain’t joking, either.”",1681
4784,"“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear anything saidabout a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that _you_ don’t knownothing about him, and _I_ don’t know nothing about him.”",1682
4785,"Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his wayand I drove mine.",1683
4786,But of course I forgot all about driving slow onaccounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap tooquick for that length of a trip.,1683
4787,"The old gentleman was at the door, andhe says:",1683
4788,"“Why, this is wonderful!",1684
4789,Whoever would a thought it was in that mare todo it?,1684
4790,I wish we’d a timed her.,1684
4791,And she hain’t sweated a hair—not ahair.,1684
4792,It’s wonderful.,1684
4793,"Why, I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for thathorse now—I wouldn’t, honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteenbefore, and thought ’twas all she was worth.”",1684
4794,That’s all he said.,1685
4795,"He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.",1685
4796,"But it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only just a farmer, he wasa preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of theplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a churchand schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and itwas worth it, too.",1685
4797,"There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that,and done the same way, down South.",1685
4798,"In about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and AuntSally she see it through the window, because it was only about fiftyyards, and says:",1686
4799,"“Why, there’s somebody come!",1687
4800,I wonder who ’tis?,1687
4801,"Why, I do believe it’sa stranger.",1687
4802,Jimmy” (that’s one of the children) “run and tell Lize toput on another plate for dinner.”,1687
4803,"Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, astranger don’t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever,for interest, when he does come.",1688
4804,"Tom was over the stile and startingfor the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, andwe was all bunched in the front door.",1688
4805,"Tom had his store clothes on, andan audience—and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.",1688
4806,In themcircumstances it warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount ofstyle that was suitable.,1688
4807,"He warn’t a boy to meeky along up that yardlike a sheep; no, he come ca’m and important, like the ram.",1688
4808,"When he gota-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it wasthe lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn’t wantto disturb them, and says:",1688
4809,“Mr.,1689
4810,"Archibald Nichols, I presume?”",1689
4811,"“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry to say ’t your driverhas deceived you; Nichols’s place is down a matter of three mile more.",1690
4812,"Come in, come in.”",1690
4813,"Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late—he’s outof sight.”",1691
4814,"“Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner withus; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”",1692
4815,"“Oh, I _can’t_ make you so much trouble; I couldn’t think of it.",1693
4816,I’llwalk—I don’t mind the distance.”,1693
4817,“But we won’t _let_ you walk—it wouldn’t be Southern hospitality to doit.,1694
4818,Come right in.”,1694
4819,"“Oh, _do_,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit of trouble to us, not abit in the world.",1695
4820,You _must_ stay.,1695
4821,"It’s a long, dusty three mile, andwe _can’t_ let you walk.",1695
4822,"And, besides, I’ve already told ’em to put onanother plate when I see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us.",1695
4823,Comeright in and make yourself at home.”,1695
4824,"So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself bepersuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a strangerfrom Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson—and he madeanother bow.",1696
4825,"Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville andeverybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, andwondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on themouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and wasgoing on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back ofher hand, and says:",1697
4826,“You owdacious puppy!”,1698
4827,"He looked kind of hurt, and says:",1699
4828,"“I’m surprised at you, m’am.”",1700
4829,"“You’re s’rp—Why, what do you reckon I am?",1701
4830,"I’ve a good notion to takeand—Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”",1701
4831,"He looked kind of humble, and says:",1702
4832,"“I didn’t mean nothing, m’am.",1703
4833,I didn’t mean no harm.,1703
4834,I—I—thought you’dlike it.”,1703
4835,"“Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning stick, and it lookedlike it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.",1704
4836,“What made you think I’d like it?”,1704
4837,"“Well, I don’t know.",1705
4838,"Only, they—they—told me you would.”",1705
4839,“_They_ told you I would.,1706

4843,"“Why, everybody.",1707
4844,"They all said so, m’am.”",1707
4845,"It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and herfingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:",1708
4846,“Who’s ‘everybody’?,1709
4847,"Out with their names, or ther’ll be an idiotshort.”",1709
4848,"He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:",1710
4849,"“I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it.",1711
4850,They told me to.,1711
4851,They all toldme to.,1711
4852,"They all said, kiss her; and said she’d like it.",1711
4853,They all saidit—every one of them.,1711
4854,"But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more—Iwon’t, honest.”",1711
4855,"“You won’t, won’t you?",1712
4856,"Well, I sh’d _reckon_ you won’t!”",1712

4860,Ilay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I askyou—or the likes of you.”,1714
4861,"“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so.",1715
4862,"I can’t make it out, somehow.",1715
4863,"They said you would, and I thought you would.",1715
4864,"But—” He stopped andlooked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eyesomewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and says, “Didn’t_you_ think she’d like me to kiss her, sir?”",1715
4865,"“Why, no; I—I—well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”",1716
4866,"Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:",1717
4867,"“Tom, didn’t _you_ think Aunt Sally ’d open out her arms and say, ‘SidSawyer—’”",1718
4868,"“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudentyoung rascal, to fool a body so—” and was going to hug him, but hefended her off, and says:",1719
4869,"“No, not till you’ve asked me first.”",1720
4870,"So she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissedhim over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, andhe took what was left.",1721
4871,And after they got a little quiet again shesays:,1721
4872,"“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.",1722
4873,"We warn’t looking for _you_at all, but only Tom.",1722
4874,Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming buthim.”,1722
4875,"“It’s because it warn’t _intended_ for any of us to come but Tom,” hesays; “but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come,too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be afirst-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for meto by-and-by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.",1723
4876,"But itwas a mistake, Aunt Sally.",1723
4877,This ain’t no healthy place for a strangerto come.”,1723
4878,"“No—not impudent whelps, Sid.",1724

4881,"Well, to think of that performance!",1724
4882,"I don’t deny it, Iwas most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”",1724
4883,"We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and thekitchen; and there was things enough on that table for sevenfamilies—and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laidin a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of oldcold cannibal in the morning.",1725
4884,"Uncle Silas he asked a pretty longblessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit,neither, the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.",1725
4885,"There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and meand Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, theydidn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we wasafraid to try to work up to it.",1725
4886,"But at supper, at night, one of thelittle boys says:",1725
4887,"“Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”",1726
4888,"“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t going to be any; and youcouldn’t go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and meall about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell thepeople; so I reckon they’ve drove the owdacious loafers out of townbefore this time.”",1727
4889,So there it was!—but _I_ couldn’t help it.,1728
4890,"Tom and me was to sleep inthe same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went upto bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down thelightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe anybodywas going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’thurry up and give them one they’d get into trouble sure.",1728
4891,"On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I wasmurdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back nomore, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom allabout our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyageas I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through themiddle of it—it was as much as half-after eight, then—here comes araging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling,and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side tolet them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and theduke astraddle of a rail—that is, I knowed it _was_ the king and theduke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn’t look likenothing in the world that was human—just looked like a couple ofmonstrous big soldier-plumes.",1729
4892,"Well, it made me sick to see it; and Iwas sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t everfeel any hardness against them any more in the world.",1729
4893,It was a dreadfulthing to see.,1729
4894,Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.,1729
4895,We see we was too late—couldn’t do no good.,1730
4896,"We asked some stragglersabout it, and they said everybody went to the show looking veryinnocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in themiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, andthe house rose up and went for them.",1730
4897,"So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I wasbefore, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though_I_ hadn’t done nothing.",1731
4898,"But that’s always the way; it don’t make nodifference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s conscience ain’tgot no sense, and just goes for him _anyway_.",1731
4899,If I had a yaller dogthat didn’t know no more than a person’s conscience does I would pisonhim.,1731
4900,"It takes up more room than all the rest of a person’s insides, andyet ain’t no good, nohow.",1731
4901,Tom Sawyer he says the same.,1731
4902,CHAPTER XXXIV.,1733
4903,"We stopped talking, and got to thinking.",1734
4904,By-and-by Tom says:,1734
4905,"“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!",1735
4906,I bet Iknow where Jim is.”,1735
4907,“No!,1736
4908,Where?”,1736
4909,“In that hut down by the ash-hopper.,1737
4910,"Why, looky here.",1737
4911,"When we was atdinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”",1737
4912,“Yes.”,1738
4913,“What did you think the vittles was for?”,1739
4914,“For a dog.”,1740
4915,“So’d I.,1741
4916,"Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”",1741
4917,“Why?”,1742
4918,“Because part of it was watermelon.”,1743
4919,“So it was—I noticed it.,1744
4920,"Well, it does beat all that I never thoughtabout a dog not eating watermelon.",1744
4921,It shows how a body can see anddon’t see at the same time.”,1744
4922,"“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he lockedit again when he came out.",1745
4923,"He fetched uncle a key about the time we gotup from table—same key, I bet.",1745
4924,"Watermelon shows man, lock showsprisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two prisoners on such a littleplantation, and where the people’s all so kind and good.",1745
4925,Jim’s theprisoner.,1745
4926,All right—I’m glad we found it out detective fashion; Iwouldn’t give shucks for any other way.,1745
4927,"Now you work your mind, andstudy out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’lltake the one we like the best.”",1745
4928,What a head for just a boy to have!,1746
4929,"If I had Tom Sawyer’s head Iwouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clownin a circus, nor nothing I can think of.",1746
4930,"I went to thinking out a plan,but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the rightplan was going to come from.",1746
4931,Pretty soon Tom says:,1746
4932,“Ready?”,1747
4933,"“Yes,” I says.",1748
4934,“All right—bring it out.”,1749
4935,"“My plan is this,” I says.",1750
4936,“We can easy find out if it’s Jim in there.,1750
4937,"Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from theisland.",1750
4938,"Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of theold man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the riveron the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way meand Jim used to do before.",1750
4939,Wouldn’t that plan work?”,1750
4940,"“_Work?_ Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.",1751
4941,But it’stoo blame’ simple; there ain’t nothing _to_ it.,1751
4942,What’s the good of aplan that ain’t no more trouble than that?,1751
4943,It’s as mild as goose-milk.,1751
4944,"Why, Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soapfactory.”",1751
4945,"I never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different; butI knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it wouldn’thave none of them objections to it.",1752
4946,And it didn’t.,1753
4947,"He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it wasworth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a manas mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.",1753
4948,"So I was satisfied,and said we would waltz in on it.",1753
4949,"I needn’t tell what it was here,because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was.",1753
4950,"I knowed he would bechanging it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in newbullinesses wherever he got a chance.",1753
4951,And that is what he done.,1753
4952,"Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was inearnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.",1754
4953,That was the thing that was too many for me.,1754
4954,"Here was a boy that wasrespectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folksat home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed;and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here hewas, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop tothis business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, beforeeverybody.",1754
4955,I _couldn’t_ understand it no way at all.,1754
4956,"It was outrageous,and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his truefriend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself.",1754
4957,"And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:",1754
4958,“Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about?,1755
4959,Don’t I generly know what I’mabout?”,1755
4960,“Yes.”,1756
4961,“Didn’t I _say_ I was going to help steal the nigger?”,1757
4962,“Yes.”,1758
4963,"“_Well_, then.”",1759
4964,"That’s all he said, and that’s all I said.",1760
4965,"It warn’t no use to say anymore; because when he said he’d do a thing, he always done it.",1760
4966,"But _I_couldn’t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I justlet it go, and never bothered no more about it.",1760
4967,"If he was bound to haveit so, _I_ couldn’t help it.",1760
4968,When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on downto the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.,1761
4969,We went through theyard so as to see what the hounds would do.,1761
4970,"They knowed us, and didn’tmake no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anythingcomes by in the night.",1761
4971,"When we got to the cabin we took a look at thefront and the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with—whichwas the north side—we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,with just one stout board nailed across it.",1761
4972,I says:,1761
4973,“Here’s the ticket.,1762
4974,This hole’s big enough for Jim to get through if wewrench off the board.”,1762
4975,Tom says:,1763
4976,"“It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playinghooky.",1764
4977,"I should _hope_ we can find a way that’s a little morecomplicated than _that_, Huck Finn.”",1764
4978,"“Well, then,” I says, “how’ll it do to saw him out, the way I donebefore I was murdered that time?”",1765
4979,"“That’s more _like_,” he says.",1766
4980,"“It’s real mysterious, and troublesome,and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that’s twice as long.",1766
4981,There ain’t no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”,1766
4982,"Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to thatjoined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.",1767
4983,"It was as longas the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide.",1767
4984,"The door to it was atthe south end, and was padlocked.",1767
4985,"Tom he went to the soap-kettle andsearched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lidwith; so he took it and prized out one of the staples.",1767
4986,"The chain felldown, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck amatch, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t noconnection with it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor nothingin it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and acrippled plow.",1767
4987,"The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in thestaple again, and the door was locked as good as ever.",1767
4988,Tom was joyful.,1767
4989,He says;,1767
4990,“Now we’re all right.,1768
4991,We’ll _dig_ him out.,1768
4992,It’ll take about a week!”,1768
4993,"Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you onlyhave to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors—butthat warn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him buthe must climb up the lightning-rod.",1769
4994,"But after he got up half way aboutthree times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last timemost busted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; butafter he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn forluck, and this time he made the trip.",1769
4995,"In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabinsto pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it_was_ Jim that was being fed.",1770
4996,"The niggers was just getting throughbreakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling up atin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others wasleaving, the key come from the house.",1770
4997,"This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool wasall tied up in little bunches with thread.",1771
4998,That was to keep witchesoff.,1771
4999,"He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, andmaking him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds ofstrange words and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched solong before in his life.",1771
5000,"He got so worked up, and got to running on soabout his troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do.",1771
5001,So Tom says:,1771
5002,“What’s the vittles for?,1772
5003,Going to feed the dogs?”,1772
5004,"The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when youheave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:",1773
5005,"“Yes, Mars Sid, _a_ dog.",1774
5006,"Cur’us dog, too.",1774
5007,Does you want to go en lookat ’im?”,1774
5008,“Yes.”,1775
5009,"I hunched Tom, and whispers:",1776
5010,"“You going, right here in the daybreak?",1777
5011,_That_ warn’t the plan.”,1777
5012,"“No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan _now_.”",1778
5013,"So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much.",1779
5014,"When we got inwe couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there,sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:",1779
5015,"“Why, _Huck!_ En good _lan_’!",1780
5016,ain’ dat Misto Tom?”,1780
5017,I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.,1781
5018,"_I_ didn’t knownothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that niggerbusted in and says:",1781
5019,"“Why, de gracious sakes!",1782
5020,do he know you genlmen?”,1782
5021,We could see pretty well now.,1783
5022,"Tom he looked at the nigger, steady andkind of wondering, and says:",1783
5023,“Does _who_ know us?”,1784
5024,"“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”",1785
5025,“I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”,1786
5026,“What _put_ it dar?,1787
5027,Didn’ he jis’ dis minute sing out like he knowedyou?”,1787
5028,"Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:",1788
5029,"“Well, that’s mighty curious.",1789
5030,_Who_ sung out?,1789
5031,_When_ did he sing out?,1789
5032,"_what_ did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca’m, and says,“Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?”",1789
5033,Of course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:,1790
5034,“No; _I_ ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”,1791
5035,"Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,and says:",1792
5036,“Did you sing out?”,1793
5037,"“No, sah,” says Jim; “_I_ hain’t said nothing, sah.”",1794
5038,“Not a word?”,1795
5039,"“No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”",1796
5040,“Did you ever see us before?”,1797
5041,"“No, sah; not as _I_ knows on.”",1798
5042,"So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, andsays, kind of severe:",1799
5043,"“What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway?",1800
5044,What made you thinksomebody sung out?”,1800
5045,"“Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.",1801
5046,"Dey’s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos’ kill me, dey sk’yers me so.",1801
5047,"Please to don’t tell nobody ’bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he’ll scoleme; ’kase he say dey _ain’t_ no witches.",1801
5048,I jis’ wish to goodness he washeah now—_den_ what would he say!,1801
5049,I jis’ bet he couldn’ fine no way togit aroun’ it _dis_ time.,1801
5050,"But it’s awluz jis’ so; people dat’s _sot_,stays sot; dey won’t look into noth’n’en fine it out f’r deyselves, enwhen _you_ fine it out en tell um ’bout it, dey doan’ b’lieve you.”",1801
5051,"Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn’t tell nobody; and told him tobuy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim,and says:",1802
5052,“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.,1803
5053,"If I was tocatch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, _I_ wouldn’tgive him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger stepped to the doorto look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers toJim and says:",1803
5054,“Don’t ever let on to know us.,1804
5055,"And if you hear any digging going onnights, it’s us; we’re going to set you free.”",1804
5056,"Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then thenigger come back, and we said we’d come again some time if the niggerwanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark,because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good tohave folks around then.",1805
5057,CHAPTER XXXV.,1807
5058,"It would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck downinto the woods; because Tom said we got to have _some_ light to see howto dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble;what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that’s calledfox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in adark place.",1808
5059,"We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set downto rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:",1808
5060,"“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.",1809
5061,And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.,1809
5062,There ain’t no watchman to be drugged—now there _ought_ to be awatchman.,1809
5063,There ain’t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.,1809
5064,"Andthere’s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg ofhis bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip offthe chain.",1809
5065,"And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to thepunkin-headed nigger, and don’t send nobody to watch the nigger.",1809
5066,"Jimcould a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t beno use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg.",1809
5067,"Why, drat it,Huck, it’s the stupidest arrangement I ever see.",1809
5068,You got to invent_all_ the difficulties.,1809
5069,"Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the bestwe can with the materials we’ve got.",1809
5070,"Anyhow, there’s one thing—there’smore honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties anddangers, where there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the peoplewho it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them allout of your own head.",1809
5071,Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.,1809
5072,"When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to _let on_ that alantern’s resky.",1809
5073,"Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if wewanted to, _I_ believe.",1809
5074,"Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt upsomething to make a saw out of the first chance we get.”",1809
5075,“What do we want of a saw?”,1810
5076,“What do we _want_ of it?,1811
5077,"Hain’t we got to saw the leg of Jim’s bedoff, so as to get the chain loose?”",1811
5078,"“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip thechain off.”",1812
5079,"“Well, if that ain’t just like you, Huck Finn.",1813
5080,You _can_ get up theinfant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.,1813
5081,"Why, hain’t you ever readany books at all?—Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?",1813
5082,Who ever heard of getting aprisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?,1813
5083,"No; the way all thebest authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it justso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be found, and put some dirtand grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can’tsee no sign of it’s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectlysound.",1813
5084,"Then, the night you’re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down shegoes; slip off your chain, and there you are.",1813
5085,"Nothing to do but hitchyour rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg inthe moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—andthere’s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up andfling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, orNavarre, or wherever it is.",1813
5086,"It’s gaudy, Huck.",1813
5087,I wish there was a moatto this cabin.,1813
5088,"If we get time, the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.”",1813
5089,I says:,1814
5090,“What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out from underthe cabin?”,1815
5091,But he never heard me.,1816
5092,He had forgot me and everything else.,1816
5093,"He had hischin in his hand, thinking.",1816
5094,"Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head;then sighs again, and says:",1816
5095,"“No, it wouldn’t do—there ain’t necessity enough for it.”",1817
5096,“For what?” I says.,1818
5097,"“Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says.",1819
5098,"“Good land!” I says; “why, there ain’t _no_ necessity for it.",1820
5099,"And whatwould you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”",1820
5100,"“Well, some of the best authorities has done it.",1821
5101,"They couldn’t get thechain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.",1821
5102,And a leg wouldbe better still.,1821
5103,But we got to let that go.,1821
5104,"There ain’t necessityenough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a nigger, and wouldn’tunderstand the reasons for it, and how it’s the custom in Europe; sowe’ll let it go.",1821
5105,But there’s one thing—he can have a rope ladder; wecan tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.,1821
5106,And wecan send it to him in a pie; it’s mostly done that way.,1821
5107,And I’ve etworse pies.”,1821
5108,"“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t got no use for arope ladder.”",1822
5109,“He _has_ got use for it.,1823
5110,"How _you_ talk, you better say; you don’tknow nothing about it.",1823
5111,He’s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.”,1823
5112,“What in the nation can he _do_ with it?”,1824
5113,“_Do_ with it?,1825
5114,"He can hide it in his bed, can’t he?",1825
5115,"That’s what they alldo; and _he’s_ got to, too.",1825
5116,"Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to doanything that’s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all thetime.",1825
5117,S’pose he _don’t_ do nothing with it?,1825
5118,"ain’t it there in his bed,for a clew, after he’s gone?",1825
5119,and don’t you reckon they’ll want clews?,1825
5120,Ofcourse they will.,1825
5121,And you wouldn’t leave them any?,1825
5122,"That would be a_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldn’t_ it!",1825
5123,I never heard of such a thing.”,1825
5124,"“Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and he’s got to have it,all right, let him have it; because I don’t wish to go back on noregulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer—if we go to tearing upour sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we’re going to get into troublewith Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re born.",1826
5125,"Now, the way I look atit, a hickry-bark ladder don’t cost nothing, and don’t waste nothing,and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, asany rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain’t had noexperience, and so _he_ don’t care what kind of a—”",1826
5126,"“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I’d keepstill—that’s what _I’d_ do.",1827
5127,Who ever heard of a state prisoner escapingby a hickry-bark ladder?,1827
5128,"Why, it’s perfectly ridiculous.”",1827
5129,"“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take myadvice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.”",1828
5130,He said that would do.,1829
5131,"And that gave him another idea, and he says:",1829
5132,"“Borrow a shirt, too.”",1830
5133,"“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”",1831
5134,“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”,1832
5135,“Journal your granny—_Jim_ can’t write.”,1833
5136,"“S’pose he _can’t_ write—he can make marks on the shirt, can’t he, ifwe make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old ironbarrel-hoop?”",1834
5137,"“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a betterone; and quicker, too.”",1835
5138,"“_Prisoners_ don’t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pullpens out of, you muggins.",1836
5139,"They _always_ make their pens out of thehardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick orsomething like that they can get their hands on; and it takes themweeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, becausethey’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall.",1836
5140,_They_ wouldn’t use agoose-quill if they had it.,1836
5141,It ain’t regular.”,1836
5142,"“Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?”",1837
5143,“Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the common sortand women; the best authorities uses their own blood.,1838
5144,"Jim can do that;and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious messageto let the world know where he’s captivated, he can write it on thebottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.",1838
5145,"TheIron Mask always done that, and it’s a blame’ good way, too.”",1838
5146,“Jim ain’t got no tin plates.,1839
5147,They feed him in a pan.”,1839
5148,“That ain’t nothing; we can get him some.”,1840
5149,“Can’t nobody _read_ his plates.”,1841
5150,"“That ain’t got anything to _do_ with it, Huck Finn.",1842
5151,All _he’s_ got todo is to write on the plate and throw it out.,1842
5152,You don’t _have_ to beable to read it.,1842
5153,"Why, half the time you can’t read anything a prisonerwrites on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”",1842
5154,"“Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?”",1843
5155,"“Why, blame it all, it ain’t the _prisoner’s_ plates.”",1844
5156,"“But it’s _somebody’s_ plates, ain’t it?”",1845
5157,"“Well, spos’n it is?",1846
5158,What does the _prisoner_ care whose—”,1846
5159,"He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.",1847
5160,So wecleared out for the house.,1847
5161,"Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off ofthe clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and wewent down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.",1848
5162,"I called itborrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said itwarn’t borrowing, it was stealing.",1848
5163,"He said we was representingprisoners; and prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they getit, and nobody don’t blame them for it, either.",1848
5164,"It ain’t no crime in aprisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it’shis right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had aperfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use forto get ourselves out of prison with.",1848
5165,"He said if we warn’t prisoners itwould be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery personwould steal when he warn’t a prisoner.",1848
5166,So we allowed we would stealeverything there was that come handy.,1848
5167,"And yet he made a mighty fuss,one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patchand eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime withouttelling them what it was for.",1848
5168,"Tom said that what he meant was, we couldsteal anything we _needed_.",1848
5169,"Well, I says, I needed the watermelon.",1848
5170,Buthe said I didn’t need it to get out of prison with; there’s where thedifference was.,1848
5171,"He said if I’d a wanted it to hide a knife in, andsmuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right.",1848
5172,"So I let it go at that, though I couldn’t see no advantage in myrepresenting a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot ofgold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog awatermelon.",1848
5173,"Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody wassettled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tomhe carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keepwatch.",1849
5174,"By-and-by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpileto talk.",1849
5175,He says:,1849
5176,“Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s easy fixed.”,1850
5177,“Tools?” I says.,1851
5178,“Yes.”,1852
5179,“Tools for what?”,1853
5180,"“Why, to dig with.",1854
5181,"We ain’t a-going to _gnaw_ him out, are we?”",1854
5182,“Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig anigger out with?” I says.,1855
5183,"He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:",1856
5184,"“Huck Finn, did you _ever_ hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels,and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself outwith?",1857
5185,Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness in you atall—what kind of a show would _that_ give him to be a hero?,1857
5186,"Why, theymight as well lend him the key and done with it.",1857
5187,"Picks and shovels—why,they wouldn’t furnish ’em to a king.”",1857
5188,"“Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks and shovels, what dowe want?”",1858
5189,“A couple of case-knives.”,1859
5190,“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”,1860
5191,“Yes.”,1861
5192,"“Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.”",1862
5193,"“It don’t make no difference how foolish it is, it’s the _right_way—and it’s the regular way.",1863
5194,"And there ain’t no _other_ way, that ever_I_ heard of, and I’ve read all the books that gives any informationabout these things.",1863
5195,"They always dig out with a case-knife—and notthrough dirt, mind you; generly it’s through solid rock.",1863
5196,"And it takesthem weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever.",1863
5197,"Why, look at oneof them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in theharbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was _he_at it, you reckon?”",1863
5198,“I don’t know.”,1864
5199,"“Well, guess.”",1865
5200,“I don’t know.,1866
5201,A month and a half.”,1866
5202,“_Thirty-seven year_—and he come out in China.,1867
5203,_That’s_ the kind.,1867
5204,Iwish the bottom of _this_ fortress was solid rock.”,1867
5205,“_Jim_ don’t know nobody in China.”,1868
5206,“What’s _that_ got to do with it?,1869
5207,Neither did that other fellow.,1869
5208,Butyou’re always a-wandering off on a side issue.,1869
5209,Why can’t you stick tothe main point?”,1869
5210,"“All right—_I_ don’t care where he comes out, so he _comes_ out; andJim don’t, either, I reckon.",1870
5211,"But there’s one thing, anyway—Jim’s tooold to be dug out with a case-knife.",1870
5212,He won’t last.”,1870
5213,"“Yes he will _last_, too.",1871
5214,"You don’t reckon it’s going to takethirty-seven years to dig out through a _dirt_ foundation, do you?”",1871
5215,"“How long will it take, Tom?”",1872
5216,"“Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn’ttake very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.",1873
5217,He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there.,1873
5218,"Then his next move will be toadvertise Jim, or something like that.",1873
5219,So we can’t resk being as longdigging him out as we ought to.,1873
5220,By rights I reckon we ought to be acouple of years; but we can’t.,1873
5221,"Things being so uncertain, what Irecommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; andafter that, we can _let on_, to ourselves, that we was at itthirty-seven years.",1873
5222,Then we can snatch him out and rush him away thefirst time there’s an alarm.,1873
5223,"Yes, I reckon that’ll be the best way.”",1873
5224,"“Now, there’s _sense_ in that,” I says.",1874
5225,"“Letting on don’t cost nothing;letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s any object, I don’t mindletting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.",1874
5226,"It wouldn’t strain menone, after I got my hand in.",1874
5227,"So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch acouple of case-knives.”",1874
5228,"“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”",1875
5229,"“Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,“there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under theweather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”",1876
5230,"He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:",1877
5231,"“It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.",1878
5232,Run along andsmouch the knives—three of them.” So I done it.,1878
5233,CHAPTER XXXVI.,1880
5234,"As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down thelightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out ourpile of fox-fire, and went to work.",1881
5235,"We cleared everything out of theway, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.",1881
5236,"Tomsaid he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it, andwhen we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know therewas any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most to theground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.",1881
5237,"So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then wewas dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t seewe’d done anything hardly.",1881
5238,At last I says:,1881
5239,"“This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,Tom Sawyer.”",1882
5240,He never said nothing.,1883
5241,"But he sighed, and pretty soon he stoppeddigging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he wasthinking.",1883
5242,Then he says:,1883
5243,"“It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work.",1884
5244,"If we was prisonersit would, because then we’d have as many years as we wanted, and nohurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, whilethey was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t get blistered, andwe could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right,and the way it ought to be done.",1884
5245,But _we_ can’t fool along; we got torush; we ain’t got no time to spare.,1884
5246,If we was to put in another nightthis way we’d have to knock off for a week to let our hands getwell—couldn’t touch a case-knife with them sooner.”,1884
5247,"“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”",1885
5248,“I’ll tell you.,1886
5249,"It ain’t right, and it ain’t moral, and I wouldn’t likeit to get out; but there ain’t only just the one way: we got to dig himout with the picks, and _let on_ it’s case-knives.”",1886
5250,"“_Now_ you’re _talking!_” I says; “your head gets leveler and levelerall the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says.",1887
5251,"“Picks is the thing, moral or nomoral; and as for me, I don’t care shucks for the morality of it,nohow.",1887
5252,"When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or aSunday-school book, I ain’t no ways particular how it’s done so it’sdone.",1887
5253,"What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; orwhat I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiestthing, that’s the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or thatwatermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a deadrat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.”",1887
5254,"“Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and letting-on in a caselike this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t approve of it, nor I wouldn’tstand by and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong iswrong, and a body ain’t got no business doing wrong when he ain’tignorant and knows better.",1888
5255,"It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim outwith a pick, _without_ any letting on, because you don’t know nobetter; but it wouldn’t for me, because I do know better.",1888
5256,Gimme acase-knife.”,1888
5257,"He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.",1889
5258,"He flung it down, andsays:",1889
5259,“Gimme a _case-knife_.”,1890
5260,I didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought.,1891
5261,"I scratched aroundamongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and hetook it and went to work, and never said a word.",1891
5262,He was always just that particular.,1892
5263,Full of principle.,1892
5264,"So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,and made the fur fly.",1893
5265,"We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was aslong as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show forit.",1893
5266,"When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doinghis level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, hishands was so sore.",1893
5267,At last he says:,1893
5268,"“It ain’t no use, it can’t be done.",1894
5269,What you reckon I better do?,1894
5270,Can’tyou think of no way?”,1894
5271,"“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.",1895
5272,"Come up the stairs, andlet on it’s a lightning-rod.”",1895
5273,So he done it.,1896
5274,"Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and Ihung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole threetin plates.",1897
5275,"Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t eversee the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in thedog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could totethem back and he could use them over again.",1897
5276,So Tom was satisfied.,1897
5277,Thenhe says:,1897
5278,"“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”",1898
5279,"“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”",1899
5280,"He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody everheard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.",1900
5281,"By-and-byhe said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no needto decide on any of them yet.",1900
5282,Said we’d got to post Jim first.,1900
5283,"That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and tookone of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heardJim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him.",1901
5284,"Then wewhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a halfthe job was done.",1901
5285,"We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin, andpawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jimawhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke himup gentle and gradual.",1901
5286,"He was so glad to see us he most cried; andcalled us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was forhaving us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg withright away, and clearing out without losing any time.",1901
5287,"But Tom he showedhim how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about ourplans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was analarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he gotaway, _sure_.",1901
5288,"So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there andtalked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions,and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray withhim, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plentyto eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:",1901
5289,“_Now_ I know how to fix it.,1902
5290,We’ll send you some things by them.”,1902
5291,"I said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the most jackassideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to me; went righton.",1903
5292,It was his way when he’d got his plans set.,1903
5293,"So he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie andother large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be onthe lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them;and we would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must stealthem out; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put themin her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they wouldbe and what they was for.",1904
5294,"And told him how to keep a journal on theshirt with his blood, and all that.",1904
5295,He told him everything.,1904
5296,"Jim hecouldn’t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was whitefolks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said hewould do it all just as Tom said.",1904
5297,"Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down goodsociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home tobed, with hands that looked like they’d been chawed.",1905
5298,Tom was in highspirits.,1905
5299,"He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and themost intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it wewould keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to ourchildren to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it betterand better the more he got used to it.",1905
5300,"He said that in that way itcould be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the besttime on record.",1905
5301,And he said it would make us all celebrated that had ahand in it.,1905
5302,"In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brasscandlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon inhis pocket.",1906
5303,"Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’snotice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of acorn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see howit would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it mostmashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a workedbetter.",1906
5304,Tom said so himself.,1906
5305,"Jim he never let on but what it was onlyjust a piece of rock or something like that that’s always getting intobread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what hejabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.",1906
5306,"And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes acouple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept onpiling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly roomin there to get your breath.",1907
5307,"By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-todoor!",1907
5308,"The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeledover on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he wasdying.",1907
5309,"Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim’s meat, andthe dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and backagain and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed the other door too.",1907
5310,"Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, andasking him if he’d been imagining he saw something again.",1907
5311,"He raised up,and blinked his eyes around, and says:",1907
5312,"“Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t b’lieve I see most amillion dogs, er devils, er some’n, I wisht I may die right heah indese tracks.",1908
5313,"I did, mos’ sholy.",1908

5316,"Butmos’ly I wisht dey’d lemme ’lone, I does.”",1908

5318,"“Well, I tell you what _I_ think.",1910
5319,What makes them come here just atthis runaway nigger’s breakfast-time?,1910
5320,It’s because they’re hungry;that’s the reason.,1910
5321,You make them a witch pie; that’s the thing for_you_ to do.”,1910

5328,"“All right, I’ll do it, seeing it’s you, and you’ve been good to us andshowed us the runaway nigger.",1914
5329,But you got to be mighty careful.,1914
5330,"When wecome around, you turn your back; and then whatever we’ve put in thepan, don’t you let on you see it at all.",1914
5331,"And don’t you look when Jimunloads the pan—something might happen, I don’t know what.",1914

5338,"So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pilein the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and piecesof bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratchedaround and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as wellas we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole itfull of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple ofshingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabblehis name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of themin Aunt Sally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’otherwe stuck in the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau,because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to therunaway nigger’s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, andTom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and AuntSally wasn’t come yet, so we had to wait a little while.",1918
5339,"And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardlywait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee withone hand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble withthe other, and says:",1919
5340,"“I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat all what _has_become of your other shirt.”",1920
5341,"My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hardpiece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on theroad with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of thechildren in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let acry out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder bluearound the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of thingsfor about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a soldout for half price if there was a bidder.",1921
5342,But after that we was allright again—it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind ofcold.,1921
5343,Uncle Silas he says:,1921
5344,"“It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it.",1922
5345,"I know perfectlywell I took it _off_, because—”",1922
5346,“Because you hain’t got but one _on_.,1923
5347,Just _listen_ at the man!,1923
5348,"_I_know you took it off, and know it by a better way than yourwool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-lineyesterday—I see it there myself.",1923
5349,"But it’s gone, that’s the long and theshort of it, and you’ll just have to change to a red flann’l one till Ican get time to make a new one.",1923
5350,And it’ll be the third I’ve made intwo years.,1923
5351,It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; andwhatever you do manage to _do_ with ’m all is more’n _I_ can make out.,1923
5352,A body ’d think you _would_ learn to take some sort of care of ’em atyour time of life.”,1923
5353,"“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.",1924
5354,"But it oughtn’t to bealtogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor havenothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t believeI’ve ever lost one of them _off_ of me.”",1924
5355,"“Well, it ain’t _your_ fault if you haven’t, Silas; you’d a done it ifyou could, I reckon.",1925
5356,"And the shirt ain’t all that’s gone, nuther.",1925
5357,Ther’s a spoon gone; and _that_ ain’t all.,1925
5358,"There was ten, and nowther’s only nine.",1925
5359,"The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf nevertook the spoon, _that’s_ certain.”",1925
5360,"“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”",1926
5361,“Ther’s six _candles_ gone—that’s what.,1927
5362,"The rats could a got thecandles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don’t walk off with thewhole place, the way you’re always going to stop their holes and don’tdo it; and if they warn’t fools they’d sleep in your hair,Silas—_you’d_ never find it out; but you can’t lay the _spoon_ on therats, and that I _know_.”",1927
5363,"“Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve been remiss; butI won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes.”",1928

5367,"Just then the nigger woman stepson to the passage, and says:",1930
5368,"“Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”",1931
5369,“A _sheet_ gone!,1932
5370,"Well, for the land’s sake!”",1932
5371,"“I’ll stop up them holes _to-day_,” says Uncle Silas, lookingsorrowful.",1933
5372,"“Oh, _do_ shet up!—s’pose the rats took the _sheet?",1934
5373,"Where’s_ it gone,Lize?”",1934
5374,"“Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally.",1935
5375,"She wuz on declo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain’ dah no mo’ now.”",1935

5380,"“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”",1938
5381,"Well, she was just a-biling.",1939
5382,I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned Iwould sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.,1939
5383,"Shekept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, andeverybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, lookingkind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.",1939
5384,"She stopped,with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was inJeruslem or somewheres.",1939
5385,"But not long, because she says:",1939
5386,“It’s _just_ as I expected.,1940
5387,"So you had it in your pocket all the time;and like as not you’ve got the other things there, too.",1940
5388,How’d it getthere?”,1940
5389,"“I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you knowI would tell.",1941
5390,"I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen beforebreakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to putmy Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain’t in; butI’ll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I’ll know Ididn’t put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down andtook up the spoon, and—”",1941
5391,"“Oh, for the land’s sake!",1942
5392,Give a body a rest!,1942
5393,"Go ’long now, the wholekit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh me again till I’ve got backmy peace of mind.”",1942
5394,"_I’d_ a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let alone speaking itout; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d a been dead.",1943
5395,"As we waspassing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, andthe shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it upand laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.",1943
5396,"Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:",1943
5397,"“Well, it ain’t no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain’treliable.” Then he says: “But he done us a good turn with the spoon,anyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and do him one without_him_ knowing it—stop up his rat-holes.”",1944
5398,"There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a wholehour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.",1945
5399,"Then we heardsteps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comesthe old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff int’other, looking as absent-minded as year before last.",1945
5400,"He went amooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d beento them all.",1945
5401,"Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip offof his candle and thinking.",1945
5402,"Then he turns off slow and dreamy towardsthe stairs, saying:",1945
5403,"“Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it.",1946
5404,I could showher now that I warn’t to blame on account of the rats.,1946
5405,But nevermind—let it go.,1946
5406,I reckon it wouldn’t do no good.”,1946
5407,"And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.",1947
5408,He was amighty nice old man.,1947
5409,And always is.,1947
5410,"Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he saidwe’d got to have it; so he took a think.",1948
5411,"When he had ciphered it out hetold me how we was to do; then we went and waited around thespoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went tocounting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one ofthem up my sleeve, and Tom says:",1948
5412,"“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons _yet_.”",1949
5413,She says:,1950
5414,"“Go ’long to your play, and don’t bother me.",1951
5415,"I know better, I counted’m myself.”",1951
5416,"“Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and _I_ can’t make but nine.”",1952
5417,"She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count—anybodywould.",1953
5418,“I declare to gracious ther’ _ain’t_ but nine!” she says.,1954
5419,"“Why, what inthe world—plague _take_ the things, I’ll count ’m again.”",1954
5420,"So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, shesays:",1955
5421,"“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s _ten_ now!” and she looked huffyand bothered both.",1956
5422,But Tom says:,1956
5423,"“Why, Aunty, _I_ don’t think there’s ten.”",1957
5424,"“You numskull, didn’t you see me _count_ ’m?”",1958
5425,"“I know, but—”",1959
5426,"“Well, I’ll count ’m _again_.”",1960
5427,"So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.",1961
5428,"Well, she _was_ in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was somad.",1961
5429,"But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d startto count in the _basket_ for a spoon sometimes; and so, three timesthey come out right, and three times they come out wrong.",1961
5430,"Then shegrabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked thecat galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace,and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’dskin us.",1961
5431,"So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocketwhilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it allright, along with her shingle nail, before noon.",1961
5432,"We was very wellsatisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice thetrouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn’t ever count themspoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’dcounted them right if she _did;_ and said that after she’d aboutcounted her head off for the next three days he judged she’d give it upand offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.",1961
5433,"So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out ofher closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for acouple of days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more,and she didn’t _care_, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of hersoul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her life;she druther die first.",1962
5434,"So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoonand the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-upcounting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it wouldblow over by-and-by.",1963
5435,But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.,1964
5436,"Wefixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got itdone at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; andwe had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through,and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out withthe smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and wecouldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in.",1964
5437,"But of coursewe thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the ladder, too,in the pie.",1964
5438,"So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore upthe sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and longbefore daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a personwith.",1964
5439,We let on it took nine months to make it.,1964
5440,"And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t gointo the pie.",1965
5441,"Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was ropeenough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over forsoup, or sausage, or anything you choose.",1965
5442,We could a had a wholedinner.,1965
5443,But we didn’t need it.,1966
5444,"All we needed was just enough for the pie, andso we throwed the rest away.",1966
5445,"We didn’t cook none of the pies in thewash-pan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noblebrass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belongedto one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over fromEngland with William the Conqueror in the _Mayflower_ or one of themearly ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots andthings that was valuable, not on account of being any account, becausethey warn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and wesnaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on thefirst pies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling on thelast one.",1966
5446,"We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals,and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut downthe lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with thelong handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turnedout a pie that was a satisfaction to look at.",1966
5447,"But the person that et itwould want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if thatrope ladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t know nothingwhat I’m talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last himtill next time, too.",1966
5448,"Nat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we put thethree tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jimgot everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he bustedinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, andscratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of thewindow-hole.",1967
5449,CHAPTER XXXVIII.,1969
5450,"Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; andJim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.",1970
5451,That’sthe one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.,1970
5452,"But he had tohave it; Tom said he’d _got_ to; there warn’t no case of a stateprisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coatof arms.",1970
5453,"“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at oldNorthumberland!",1971
5454,"Why, Huck, s’pose it _is_ considerble trouble?—what yougoing to do?—how you going to get around it?",1971
5455,Jim’s _got_ to do hisinscription and coat of arms.,1971
5456,They all do.”,1971
5457,Jim says:,1972
5458,"“Why, Mars Tom, I hain’t got no coat o’ arm; I hain’t got nuffn butdish yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”",1973
5459,"“Oh, you don’t understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”",1974
5460,"“Well,” I says, “Jim’s right, anyway, when he says he ain’t got no coatof arms, because he hain’t.”",1975
5461,"“I reckon _I_ knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he’ll have onebefore he goes out of this—because he’s going out _right_, and thereain’t going to be no flaws in his record.”",1976
5462,"So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jima-making his’n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tomset to work to think out the coat of arms.",1977
5463,"By-and-by he said he’dstruck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but therewas one which he reckoned he’d decide on.",1977
5464,He says:,1977
5465,"“On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend _or_ in the dexter base, a saltire_murrey_ in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, andunder his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron _vert_ ina chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field _azure_, withthe nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runawaynigger, _sable_, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister;and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto,_Maggiore fretta, minore atto._ Got it out of a book—means the morehaste, the less speed.”",1978
5466,"“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”",1979
5467,"“We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig inlike all git-out.”",1980
5468,"“Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s _some_ of it?",1981
5469,What’s a fess?”,1981
5470,“A fess—a fess is—_you_ don’t need to know what a fess is.,1982
5471,I’ll showhim how to make it when he gets to it.”,1982
5472,"“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.",1983
5473,What’s a barsinister?”,1983
5474,"“Oh, _I_ don’t know.",1984
5475,But he’s got to have it.,1984
5476,All the nobility does.”,1984
5477,That was just his way.,1985
5478,"If it didn’t suit him to explain a thing to you,he wouldn’t do it.",1985
5479,"You might pump at him a week, it wouldn’t make nodifference.",1985
5480,"He’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in tofinish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out amournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done.",1986
5481,"Hemade up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:",1986

5491,"When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which onefor Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at lasthe allowed he would let him scrabble them all on.",1991
5492,"Jim said it wouldtake him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with anail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said hewould block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing to dobut just follow the lines.",1991
5493,Then pretty soon he says:,1991
5494,"“Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t have log wallsin a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.",1992
5495,We’ll fetch arock.”,1992
5496,Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take himsuch a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever getout.,1993
5497,But Tom said he would let me help him do it.,1993
5498,Then he took a lookto see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens.,1993
5499,"It was mostpesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no show toget well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no headway, hardly;so Tom says:",1993
5500,“I know how to fix it.,1994
5501,"We got to have a rock for the coat of arms andmournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.",1994
5502,"There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll smouch it,and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it,too.”",1994
5503,It warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a grindstonenuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it.,1995
5504,"It warn’t quite midnight yet, sowe cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.",1995
5505,"We smouched thegrindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nationtough job.",1995
5506,"Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t keep her fromfalling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.",1995
5507,"Tom saidshe was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.",1995
5508,"We got herhalf way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded withsweat.",1995
5509,We see it warn’t no use; we got to go and fetch Jim.,1995
5510,"So heraised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt itround and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and downthere, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her alonglike nothing; and Tom superintended.",1995
5511,He could out-superintend any boy Iever see.,1995
5512,He knowed how to do everything.,1995
5513,"Our hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the grindstonethrough; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.",1996
5514,"Then Tommarked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work onthem, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage inthe lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of hiscandle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide thegrindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it.",1996
5515,"Then we helped him fixhis chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.",1996
5516,"But Tomthought of something, and says:",1996
5517,"“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”",1997
5518,"“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.”",1998
5519,"“All right, we’ll get you some.”",1999

5604,So Tom was stumped.,2035
5605,"But he studied it over, and then said Jim wouldhave to worry along the best he could with an onion.",2035
5606,"He promised hewould go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’scoffee-pot, in the morning.",2035
5607,"Jim said he would “jis’ ’s soon havetobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it, and with thework and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, andpetting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top ofall the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, andjournals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry andresponsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, thatTom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened downwith more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to makea name for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them,and they was just about wasted on him.",2035
5608,"So Jim he was sorry, and said hewouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.",2035
5609,CHAPTER XXXIX.,2037
5610,"In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap andfetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hourwe had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it andput it in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed.",2038
5611,"But while we was gonefor spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelpsfound it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would comeout, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back shewas a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doingwhat they could to keep off the dull times for her.",2038
5612,"So she took anddusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hourscatching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and theywarn’t the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick ofthe flock.",2038
5613,I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haulwas.,2038
5614,"We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, andcaterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’snest, but we didn’t.",2039
5615,The family was at home.,2039
5616,"We didn’t give it rightup, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we’dtire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and they done it.",2039
5617,"Then wegot allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all rightagain, but couldn’t set down convenient.",2039
5618,"And so we went for the snakes,and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them ina bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, anda rattling good honest day’s work: and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not!",2039
5619,"And there warn’t a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn’thalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.",2039
5620,"But it didn’tmatter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.",2039
5621,So wejudged we could get some of them again.,2039
5622,"No, there warn’t no realscarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.",2039
5623,"You’d seethem dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and theygenerly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and mostof the time where you didn’t want them.",2039
5624,"Well, they was handsome andstriped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that nevermade no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breedwhat they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix it;and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make nodifference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down andlight out.",2039
5625,I never see such a woman.,2039
5626,And you could hear her whoop toJericho.,2039
5627,You couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one of them with thetongs.,2039
5628,And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scrambleout and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire.,2039
5629,Shedisturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn’tever been no snakes created.,2039
5630,"Why, after every last snake had been goneclear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn’t over ityet; she warn’t near over it; when she was setting thinking aboutsomething you could touch her on the back of her neck with a featherand she would jump right out of her stockings.",2039
5631,It was very curious.,2039
5632,ButTom said all women was just so.,2039
5633,He said they was made that way for somereason or other.,2039
5634,"We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and sheallowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we everloaded up the place again with them.",2040
5635,"I didn’t mind the lickings,because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we hadto lay in another lot.",2040
5636,"But we got them laid in, and all the otherthings; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s was whenthey’d all swarm out for music and go for him.",2040
5637,"Jim didn’t like thespiders, and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and so they’d lay for him,and make it mighty warm for him.",2040
5638,"And he said that between the rats andthe snakes and the grindstone there warn’t no room in bed for him,skasely; and when there was, a body couldn’t sleep, it was so lively,and it was always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept atone time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the ratswas on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, sohe always had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other gang having acircus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders wouldtake a chance at him as he crossed over.",2040
5639,"He said if he ever got outthis time he wouldn’t ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.",2040
5640,"Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.",2041
5641,"The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim hewould get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink wasfresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved onthe grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up thesawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.",2041
5642,"We reckoned we wasall going to die, but didn’t.",2041
5643,It was the most undigestible sawdust Iever see; and Tom said the same.,2041
5644,"But as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and wewas all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.",2042
5645,"The old man hadwrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and gettheir runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t nosuch plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louisand New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones itgive me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose.",2042
5646,"So Tomsaid, now for the nonnamous letters.",2042
5647,“What’s them?” I says.,2043
5648,“Warnings to the people that something is up.,2044
5649,"Sometimes it’s done oneway, sometimes another.",2044
5650,But there’s always somebody spying around thatgives notice to the governor of the castle.,2044
5651,When Louis XVI.,2044
5652,"was goingto light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.",2044
5653,"It’s a very goodway, and so is the nonnamous letters.",2044
5654,We’ll use them both.,2044
5655,"And it’susual for the prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and shestays in, and he slides out in her clothes.",2044
5656,"We’ll do that, too.”",2044
5657,"“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for thatsomething’s up?",2045
5658,Let them find it out for themselves—it’s theirlookout.”,2045
5659,"“Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them.",2046
5660,It’s the way they’ve actedfrom the very start—left us to do _everything_.,2046
5661,They’re so confidingand mullet-headed they don’t take notice of nothing at all.,2046
5662,"So if wedon’t _give_ them notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interferewith us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ’ll gooff perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing—won’t be nothing _to_ it.”",2046
5663,"“Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”",2047
5664,"“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted.",2048
5665,So I says:,2048
5666,“But I ain’t going to make no complaint.,2049
5667,Any way that suits you suitsme.,2049
5668,What you going to do about the servant-girl?”,2049
5669,“You’ll be her.,2050
5670,"You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook thatyaller girl’s frock.”",2050
5671,"“Why, Tom, that’ll make trouble next morning; because, of course, sheprob’bly hain’t got any but that one.”",2051
5672,"“I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry thenonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”",2052
5673,"“All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in myown togs.”",2053
5674,"“You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?”",2054
5675,"“No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.”",2055
5676,“That ain’t got nothing to do with it.,2056
5677,"The thing for us to do is justto do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do itor not.",2056
5678,Hain’t you got no principle at all?”,2056
5679,"“All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the servant-girl.",2057
5680,Who’s Jim’smother?”,2057
5681,“I’m his mother.,2058
5682,I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”,2058
5683,"“Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”",2059
5684,“Not much.,2060
5685,"I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw and lay it on his bedto represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ’ll take the niggerwoman’s gown off of me and wear it, and we’ll all evade together.",2060
5686,Whena prisoner of style escapes it’s called an evasion.,2060
5687,"It’s always calledso when a king escapes, f’rinstance.",2060
5688,And the same with a king’s son; itdon’t make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnaturalone.”,2060
5689,"So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’sfrock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door,the way Tom told me to.",2061
5690,It said:,2061
5691,_Beware.,2062
5692,Trouble is brewing.,2062
5693,Keep a sharp lookout._ UNKNOWN FRIEND.,2062
5694,"Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skulland crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of acoffin on the back door.",2063
5695,I never see a family in such a sweat.,2063
5696,Theycouldn’t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghostslaying for them behind everything and under the beds and shiveringthrough the air.,2063
5697,"If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said“ouch!” if anything fell, she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happenedto touch her, when she warn’t noticing, she done the same; she couldn’tface noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was somethingbehind her every time—so she was always a-whirling around sudden, andsaying “ouch,” and before she’d got two-thirds around she’d whirl backagain, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but shedasn’t set up.",2063
5698,"So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said henever see a thing work more satisfactory.",2063
5699,He said it showed it was doneright.,2063
5700,"So he said, now for the grand bulge!",2064
5701,"So the very next morning at thestreak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what webetter do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was goingto have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.",2064
5702,"Tom he went down thelightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door wasasleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.",2064
5703,Thisletter said:,2064
5704,"Don’t betray me, I wish to be your friend.",2065
5705,"There is a desprate gang ofcutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal yourrunaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so asyou will stay in the house and not bother them.",2065

5708,"I am to be off a piece and blow a tinhorn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheepsoon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are gettinghis chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them atyour leasure.",2065
5709,"Don’t do anything but just the way I am telling you, ifyou do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo.",2065
5710,I donot wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.,2065

5713,"We was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and wentover the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took alook at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which endthey was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we wasdone supper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never leton a word about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowedas much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairsand her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up agood lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up abouthalf-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole andwas going to start with the lunch, but says:",2069
5714,“Where’s the butter?”,2070
5715,"“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn-pone.”",2071
5716,"“Well, you _left_ it laid out, then—it ain’t here.”",2072
5717,"“We can get along without it,” I says.",2073
5718,"“We can get along _with_ it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellarand fetch it.",2074
5719,And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and comealong.,2074
5720,"I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s clothes to represent hismother in disguise, and be ready to _ba_ like a sheep and shove soonas you get there.”",2074
5721,"So out he went, and down cellar went I.",2075
5722,"The hunk of butter, big as aperson’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab ofcorn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairsvery stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comesAunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, andclapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and shesays:",2075
5723,“You been down cellar?”,2076
5724,“Yes’m.”,2077

5733,"“I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious ifI have.”",2085
5734,"I reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but Is’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in asweat about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so shesays, very decided:",2086
5735,“You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.,2087
5736,"Youbeen up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll find out whatit is before _I’m_ done with you.”",2087
5737,So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.,2088

5739,"Fifteen farmers, and every one of themhad a gun.",2088
5740,"I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.",2088
5741,"They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like theywarn’t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off theirhats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changingtheir seats, and fumbling with their buttons.",2088
5742,"I warn’t easy myself, butI didn’t take my hat off, all the same.",2088
5743,"I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, ifshe wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone thisthing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got ourselves into, sowe could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jimbefore these rips got out of patience and come for us.",2089
5744,"At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I _couldn’t_ answerthem straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because these menwas in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right _now_ andlay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few minutes tomidnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for thesheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and mea-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was thatscared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butterbeginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and prettysoon, when one of them says, “_I’m_ for going and getting in the cabin_first_ and right _now_, and catching them when they come,” I mostdropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, andAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:",2090

5751,"I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.",2094
5752,"I couldn’t hardly get mywords out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we mustjump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house full of men,yonder, with guns!",2094
5753,His eyes just blazed; and he says:,2095
5754,“No!—is that so?,2096
5755,_Ain’t_ it bully!,2096
5756,"Why, Huck, if it was to do overagain, I bet I could fetch two hundred!",2096
5757,If we could put it off till—”,2096
5758,“Hurry!,2097
5759,_hurry!_” I says.,2097
5760,“Where’s Jim?”,2097
5761,“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.,2098
5762,"He’sdressed, and everything’s ready.",2098
5763,Now we’ll slide out and give thesheep-signal.”,2098
5764,"But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard thembegin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:",2099
5765,“I _told_ you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come—the door is locked.,2100
5766,"Here, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for ’em in thedark and kill ’em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,and listen if you can hear ’em coming.”",2100
5767,"So in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on uswhilst we was hustling to get under the bed.",2101
5768,"But we got under allright, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next, andTom last, which was according to Tom’s orders.",2101
5769,"Now we was in thelean-to, and heard trampings close by outside.",2101
5770,"So we crept to the door,and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn’tmake out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he wouldlisten for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim mustglide out first, and him last.",2101
5771,"So he set his ear to the crack andlistened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping aroundout there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, andstooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, andslipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it allright, and me and Jim over it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on asplinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he hadto pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as hedropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:",2101
5772,“Who’s that?,2102
5773,"Answer, or I’ll shoot!”",2102
5774,But we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.,2103
5775,"Then therewas a rush, and a _bang, bang, bang!_ and the bullets fairly whizzedaround us!",2103
5776,We heard them sing out:,2103
5777,“Here they are!,2104
5778,They’ve broke for the river!,2104
5779,"After ’em, boys, and turnloose the dogs!”",2104
5780,"So here they come, full tilt.",2105
5781,"We could hear them because they woreboots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell.",2105
5782,"We wasin the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us wedodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behindthem.",2105
5783,"They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t scare off therobbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here theycome, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so westopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn’tnobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just saidhowdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; andthen we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearlyto the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe wastied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of theriver, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to.",2105
5784,"Then westruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; andwe could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and downthe bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out.",2105
5785,Andwhen we stepped onto the raft I says:,2105
5786,"“_Now_, old Jim, you’re a free man _again_, and I bet you won’t ever bea slave no more.”",2106
5787,"“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.",2107
5788,"It ’uz planned beautiful, enit ’uz _done_ beautiful; en dey ain’t _nobody_ kin git up a plan dat’smo’ mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”",2107
5789,"We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all becausehe had a bullet in the calf of his leg.",2108
5790,When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we didbefore.,2109
5791,"It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid himin the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him,but he says:",2109
5792,“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.,2110
5793,"Don’t stop now; don’t fool aroundhere, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, andset her loose!",2110
5794,"Boys, we done it elegant!—’deed we did.",2110
5795,"I wish _we’d_ ahad the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of SaintLouis, ascend to heaven!’ wrote down in _his_ biography; no, sir, we’da whooped him over the _border_—that’s what we’d a done with _him_—anddone it just as slick as nothing at all, too.",2110
5796,Man the sweeps—man thesweeps!”,2110
5797,But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking.,2111
5798,"And after we’d thought aminute, I says:",2111
5799,"“Say it, Jim.”",2112
5800,So he says:,2113
5801,"“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.",2114
5802,"Ef it wuz _him_ dat ’uzbein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, ‘Go onen save me, nemmine ’bout a doctor f’r to save dis one?’ Is dat likeMars Tom Sawyer?",2114
5803,Would he say dat?,2114
5804,You _bet_ he wouldn’t!,2114
5805,"_Well_, den,is _Jim_ gywne to say it?",2114
5806,"No, sah—I doan’ budge a step out’n dis place’dout a _doctor;_ not if it’s forty year!”",2114
5807,"I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he didsay—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.",2115
5808,"He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it andwouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loosehimself; but we wouldn’t let him.",2115
5809,"Then he give us a piece of his mind,but it didn’t do no good.",2115
5810,"So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:",2116
5811,"“Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the way to do whenyou get to the village.",2117
5812,"Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tightand fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a pursefull of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around theback alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in thecanoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and takehis chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till you get himback to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find itagain.",2117
5813,It’s the way they all do.”,2117
5814,"So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when hesee the doctor coming till he was gone again.",2118
5815,CHAPTER XLI.,2120
5816,"The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I gothim up.",2121
5817,"I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island huntingyesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, andabout midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went offand shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix itand not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wantedto come home this evening and surprise the folks.",2121
5818,“Who is your folks?” he says.,2122
5819,"“The Phelpses, down yonder.”",2123
5820,"“Oh,” he says.",2124
5821,"And after a minute, he says:",2124
5822,“How’d you say he got shot?”,2125
5823,"“He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”",2126
5824,"“Singular dream,” he says.",2127
5825,"So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.",2128
5826,"Butwhen he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her—said she was bigenough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two.",2128
5827,I says:,2128
5828,"“Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easyenough.”",2129
5829,“What three?”,2130
5830,"“Why, me and Sid, and—and—and _the guns;_ that’s what I mean.”",2131
5831,"“Oh,” he says.",2132
5832,"But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head,and said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one.",2133
5833,"But they wasall locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to waittill he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better godown home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.",2133
5834,"But Isaid I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then hestarted.",2133
5835,I struck an idea pretty soon.,2134
5836,"I says to myself, spos’n he can’t fixthat leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying is?",2134
5837,spos’n it takes him three or four days?,2134
5838,What are we going to do?—layaround there till he lets the cat out of the bag?,2134
5839,"No, sir; I know what_I’ll_ do.",2134
5840,"I’ll wait, and when he comes back if he says he’s got to goany more I’ll get down there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tiehim, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom’s donewith him we’ll give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then lethim get ashore.",2134
5841,So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time Iwaked up the sun was away up over my head!,2135
5842,"I shot out and went for thedoctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the night some timeor other, and warn’t back yet.",2135
5843,"Well, thinks I, that looks powerful badfor Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island right off.",2135
5844,"So away I shoved,and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas’sstomach!",2135
5845,He says:,2135
5846,"“Why, _Tom!_ Where you been all this time, you rascal?”",2136
5847,"“_I_ hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runawaynigger—me and Sid.”",2137
5848,"“Why, where ever did you go?” he says.",2138
5849,“Your aunt’s been mightyuneasy.”,2138
5850,"“She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right.",2139
5851,"We followed the menand the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought weheard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them andcrossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of them; so we cruised alongup-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoeand went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then wepaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at the post-office to seewhat he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to get something to eat forus, and then we’re going home.”",2139
5852,"So then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as Isuspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of theoffice, and we waited a while longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the oldman said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he gotdone fooling around—but we would ride.",2140
5853,"I couldn’t get him to let mestay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use in it, and Imust come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.",2140
5854,"When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed andcried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hernthat don’t amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when hecome.",2141
5855,"And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to dinner;and such another clack a body never heard.",2142
5856,Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was theworst; her tongue was a-going all the time.,2142
5857,She says:,2142
5858,"“Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ I b’lievethe nigger was crazy.",2143
5859,"I says to Sister Damrell—didn’t I, SisterDamrell?—s’I, he’s crazy, s’I—them’s the very words I said.",2143
5860,"You allhearn me: he’s crazy, s’I; everything shows it, s’I.",2143
5861,"Look at that-airgrindstone, s’I; want to tell _me_’t any cretur ’t’s in his right mind’s a goin’ to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s’I?",2143
5862,"Here sich ’n’ sich a person busted his heart; ’n’ here so ’n’ so peggedalong for thirty-seven year, ’n’ all that—natcherl son o’ Louissomebody, ’n’ sich everlast’n rubbage.",2143
5863,"He’s plumb crazy, s’I; it’s whatI says in the fust place, it’s what I says in the middle, ’n’ it’s whatI says last ’n’ all the time—the nigger’s crazy—crazy ’sNebokoodneezer, s’I.”",2143
5864,"“An’ look at that-air ladder made out’n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,” saysold Mrs. Damrell; “what in the name o’ goodness _could_ he ever wantof—”",2144
5865,"“The very words I was a-sayin’ no longer ago th’n this minute to SisterUtterback, ’n’ she’ll tell you so herself.",2145
5866,"Sh-she, look at that-air ragladder, sh-she; ’n’ s’I, yes, _look_ at it, s’I—what _could_ hea-wanted of it, s’I.",2145
5867,"Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she—”",2145

5877,"“You may _well_ say it, Brer Hightower!",2149

5885,"“Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o’ niggers in thereevery night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.",2150

5887,"Must a ben a raft uv ’m at it right along, allthe time, amost.",2150
5888,"Why, I’d give two dollars to have it read to me; ’n’as for the niggers that wrote it, I ’low I’d take ’n’ lash ’m t’ll—”",2150
5889,"“People to _help_ him, Brother Marples!",2151

5891,"Why, they’ve stoleeverything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all thetime, mind you.",2151
5892,They stole that shirt right off o’ the line!,2151
5893,"and as forthat sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther’ ain’t no telling howmany times they _didn’t_ steal that; and flour, and candles, andcandlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousandthings that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me andSilas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day _and_ night, as Iwas a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair norsight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and beholdyou, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not onlyfools _us_ but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets _away_with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men andtwenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time!",2151
5894,"I tellyou, it just bangs anything I ever _heard_ of.",2151
5895,"Why, _sperits_ couldn’ta done better and been no smarter.",2151
5896,"And I reckon they must a _been_sperits—because, _you_ know our dogs, and ther’ ain’t no better; well,them dogs never even got on the _track_ of ’m once!",2151
5897,You explain _that_to me if you can!—_any_ of you!”,2151

5903,"“’Fraid to _live!_—why, I was that scared I dasn’t hardly go to bed, orget up, or lay down, or _set_ down, Sister Ridgeway.",2157
5904,"Why, they’d stealthe very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster _I_was in by the time midnight come last night.",2157
5905,I hope to gracious if Iwarn’t afraid they’d steal some o’ the family!,2157
5906,I was just to that passI didn’t have no reasoning faculties no more.,2157
5907,"It looks foolish enough_now_, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there’s my two poor boysasleep, ’way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodnessI was that uneasy ’t I crep’ up there and locked ’em in!",2157
5908,I _did_.,2157
5909,Andanybody would.,2157
5910,"Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and itkeeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and yourwits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o’ wild things,and by-and-by you think to yourself, spos’n _I_ was a boy, and was awayup there, and the door ain’t locked, and you—” She stopped, lookingkind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and whenher eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.",2157
5911,"Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in thatroom this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.",2158
5912,So I done it.,2158
5913,"But I dasn’t go fur, or she’d a sent for me.",2158
5914,"And when itwas late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and toldher the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door waslocked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down thelightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t neverwant to try _that_ no more.",2158
5915,"And then I went on and told her all what Itold Uncle Silas before; and then she said she’d forgive us, and maybeit was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect ofboys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she couldsee; and so, as long as no harm hadn’t come of it, she judged shebetter put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she hadus still, stead of fretting over what was past and done.",2158
5916,"So then shekissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of abrown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:",2158
5917,"“Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet!",2159
5918,What _has_become of that boy?”,2159
5919,I see my chance; so I skips up and says:,2160
5920,"“I’ll run right up to town and get him,” I says.",2161
5921,"“No you won’t,” she says.",2162
5922,“You’ll stay right wher’ you are; _one’s_enough to be lost at a time.,2162
5923,"If he ain’t here to supper, your uncle ’llgo.”",2162
5924,"Well, he warn’t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.",2163
5925,He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’strack.,2164
5926,"Aunt Sally was a good _deal_ uneasy; but Uncle Silas he saidthere warn’t no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and you’llsee this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.",2164
5927,So she had tobe satisfied.,2164
5928,"But she said she’d set up for him a while anyway, andkeep a light burning so he could see it.",2164
5929,"And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched hercandle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and likeI couldn’t look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talkedwith me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’tseem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me everynow and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybedrownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering ordead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip downsilent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be homein the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me,and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done hergood, and she was in so much trouble.",2165
5930,"And when she was going away shelooked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:",2165
5931,"“The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the window and therod; but you’ll be good, _won’t_ you?",2166
5932,And you won’t go?,2166
5933,For _my_ sake.”,2166
5934,"Laws knows I _wanted_ to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was allintending to go; but after that I wouldn’t a went, not for kingdoms.",2167
5935,"But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept veryrestless.",2168
5936,"And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slippedaround front, and see her setting there by her candle in the windowwith her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished Icould do something for her, but I couldn’t, only to swear that Iwouldn’t never do nothing to grieve her any more.",2168
5937,"And the third time Iwaked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candlewas most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and shewas asleep.",2168
5938,CHAPTER XLII.,2170
5939,"The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get notrack of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and notsaying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold,and not eating anything.",2171
5940,And by-and-by the old man says:,2171
5941,“Did I give you the letter?”,2172
5942,“What letter?”,2173
5943,“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”,2174
5944,"“No, you didn’t give me no letter.”",2175
5945,"“Well, I must a forgot it.”",2176
5946,"So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he hadlaid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.",2177
5947,She says:,2177
5948,"“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg—it’s from Sis.”",2178
5949,I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir.,2179
5950,Butbefore she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she seesomething.,2179
5951,And so did I.,2179
5952,"It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that olddoctor; and Jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;and a lot of people.",2179
5953,"I hid the letter behind the first thing that comehandy, and rushed.",2179
5954,"She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:",2179
5955,"“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!”",2180
5956,"And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,which showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,and says:",2181
5957,"“He’s alive, thank God!",2182
5958,"And that’s enough!” and she snatched a kiss ofhim, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering ordersright and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tonguecould go, every jump of the way.",2182
5959,I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and theold doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.,2183
5960,"The menwas very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example toall the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to runaway like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping awhole family scared most to death for days and nights.",2183
5961,"But the otherssaid, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, andhis owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.",2183
5962,"So that cooledthem down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxiousfor to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the veryones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got theirsatisfaction out of him.",2183
5963,"They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two sidethe head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never leton to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his ownclothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time,but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands,too, and both legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread andwater to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auctionbecause he didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up ourhole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch aroundabout the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in thedaytime; and about this time they was through with the job and wastapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the olddoctor comes and takes a look, and says:",2184
5964,"“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t abad nigger.",2185
5965,"When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cutthe bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for meto leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a littleworse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t letme come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d killme, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t doanything at all with him; so I says, I got to have _help_ somehow; andthe minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and sayshe’ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well.",2185
5966,"Of course Ijudged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I _was!_ and there I hadto stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night.",2185
5967,"Itwas a fix, I tell you!",2185
5968,"I had a couple of patients with the chills, andof course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t,because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yetnever a skiff come close enough for me to hail.",2185
5969,"So there I had to stickplumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was abetter nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to doit, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been workedmain hard lately.",2185
5970,"I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, anigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too.",2185
5971,"Ihad everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as hewould a done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but thereI _was_, with both of ’m on my hands, and there I had to stick tillabout dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as goodluck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his headpropped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, andthey slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowedwhat he was about, and we never had no trouble.",2185
5972,"And the boy being in akind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the rafton, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never madethe least row nor said a word from the start.",2185
5973,"He ain’t no bad nigger,gentlemen; that’s what I think about him.”",2185
5974,Somebody says:,2186
5975,"“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”",2187
5976,"Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful tothat old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it wasaccording to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a goodheart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.",2188
5977,"Then they allagreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have somenotice took of it, and reward.",2188
5978,"So every one of them promised, right outand hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.",2188
5979,Then they come out and locked him up.,2189
5980,"I hoped they was going to say hecould have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rottenheavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but theydidn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, butI judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other assoon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead ofme—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid beingshot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted nightpaddling around hunting the runaway nigger.",2189
5981,But I had plenty time.,2190
5982,"Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all dayand all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodgedhim.",2190
5983,"Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said AuntSally was gone to get a nap.",2191
5984,"So I slips to the sick-room, and if Ifound him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family thatwould wash.",2191
5985,"But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; andpale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come.",2191
5986,So I set down andlaid for him to wake.,2191
5987,"In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes glidingin, and there I was, up a stump again!",2191
5988,"She motioned me to be still, andset down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyfulnow, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleepinglike that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all thetime, and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.",2191
5989,"So we set there watching, and by-and-by he stirs a bit, and opened hiseyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:",2192
5990,"“Hello!—why, I’m at _home!_ How’s that?",2193
5991,Where’s the raft?”,2193
5992,"“It’s all right,” I says.",2194
5993,“And _Jim?_”,2195
5994,"“The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash.",2196
5995,"But he nevernoticed, but says:",2196
5996,“Good!,2197
5997,Splendid!,2197
5998,_Now_ we’re all right and safe!,2197
5999,Did you tell Aunty?”,2197
6000,"I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what, Sid?”",2198
6001,"“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”",2199
6002,“What whole thing?”,2200
6003,"“Why, _the_ whole thing.",2201
6004,There ain’t but one; how we set the runawaynigger free—me and Tom.”,2201

6009,We_did_ set him free—me and Tom.,2203
6010,"We laid out to do it, and we _done_ it.",2203
6011,"And we done it elegant, too.” He’d got a start, and she never checkedhim up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and Isee it warn’t no use for _me_ to put in.",2203
6012,"“Why, Aunty, it cost us apower of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you wasall asleep.",2203
6013,"And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt,and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and thewarming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things,and you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, andinscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think _half_ thefun it was.",2203
6014,"And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things,and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down thelightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the ropeladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and thingsto work with in your apron pocket—”",2203
6015,“Mercy sakes!”,2204
6016,"“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company forJim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat thatyou come near spiling the whole business, because the men come beforewe was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and letdrive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and letthem go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, butwent for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft,and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all byourselves, and _wasn’t_ it bully, Aunty!”",2205
6017,"“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!",2206
6018,"So it was_you_, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all this trouble,and turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most todeath.",2206

6021,"But Tom, he _was_ so proud and joyful, he just _couldn’t_ hold in, andhis tongue just _went_ it—she a-chipping in, and spitting fire allalong, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; andshe says:",2207
6022,"“_Well_, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it _now_, for mind Itell you if I catch you meddling with him again—”",2208
6023,"“Meddling with _who?_” Tom says, dropping his smile and lookingsurprised.",2209
6024,"“With _who?_ Why, the runaway nigger, of course.",2210
6025,Who’d you reckon?”,2210
6026,"Tom looks at me very grave, and says:",2211
6027,"“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right?",2212
6028,Hasn’t he got away?”,2212
6029,“_Him?_” says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger?,2213
6030,’Deed he hasn’t.,2213
6031,"They’vegot him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that cabin again, on breadand water, and loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or sold!”",2213
6032,"Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils openingand shutting like gills, and sings out to me:",2214
6033,“They hain’t no _right_ to shut him up!,2215
6034,_Shove!_—and don’t you lose aminute.,2215
6035,Turn him loose!,2215

6040,"OldMiss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was goingto sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in herwill.”",2217
6041,"“Then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he wasalready free?”",2218
6042,"“Well, that _is_ a question, I must say; and _just_ like women!",2219
6043,"Why, Iwanted the _adventure_ of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep in bloodto—goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!”",2219
6044,"If she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking assweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!",2220
6045,"Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, andcried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,for it was getting pretty sultry for _us_, seemed to me.",2221
6046,"And I peepedout, and in a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose andstood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles—kind of grindinghim into the earth, you know.",2221
6047,And then she says:,2221
6048,"“Yes, you _better_ turn y’r head away—I would if I was you, Tom.”",2222
6049,"“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “_is_ he changed so?",2223
6050,"Why, that ain’t_Tom_, it’s Sid; Tom’s—Tom’s—why, where is Tom?",2223
6051,He was here a minuteago.”,2223
6052,“You mean where’s Huck _Finn_—that’s what you mean!,2224
6053,I reckon I hain’traised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I_see_ him.,2224
6054,That _would_ be a pretty howdy-do.,2224
6055,"Come out from under thatbed, Huck Finn.”",2224
6056,So I done it.,2225
6057,But not feeling brash.,2225
6058,"Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I eversee—except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they toldit all to him.",2226
6059,"It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’tknow nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meetingsermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because theoldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it.",2226
6060,"So Tom’s Aunt Polly,she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how Iwas in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for TomSawyer—she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’mused to it now, and ’tain’t no need to change”—that when Aunt Sallytook me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn’t no other way, andI knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being amystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectlysatisfied.",2226
6061,"And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and madethings as soft as he could for me.",2226
6062,"And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson settingJim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and tookall that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free!",2227
6063,"and I couldn’tever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.",2227
6064,"Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tomand _Sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:",2228
6065,"“Look at that, now!",2229
6066,"I might have expected it, letting him go off thatway without anybody to watch him.",2229
6067,"So now I got to go and trapse all theway down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what thatcreetur’s up to _this_ time; as long as I couldn’t seem to get anyanswer out of you about it.”",2229
6068,"“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.",2230
6069,"“Well, I wonder!",2231
6070,"Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could meanby Sid being here.”",2231
6071,"“Well, I never got ’em, Sis.”",2232
6072,"Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:",2233
6073,"“You, Tom!”",2234
6074,"“Well—_what?_” he says, kind of pettish.",2235
6075,"“Don’t you what _me_, you impudent thing—hand out them letters.”",2236
6076,“What letters?”,2237
6077,“_Them_ letters.,2238
6078,"I be bound, if I have to take aholt of you I’ll—”",2238
6079,“They’re in the trunk.,2239
6080,"There, now.",2239
6081,And they’re just the same as theywas when I got them out of the office.,2239
6082,"I hain’t looked into them, Ihain’t touched them.",2239
6083,"But I knowed they’d make trouble, and I thought ifyou warn’t in no hurry, I’d—”",2239
6084,"“Well, you _do_ need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it.",2240
6085,And Iwrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose he—”,2240
6086,"“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but _it’s_ all right,I’ve got that one.”",2241
6087,"I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned maybeit was just as safe to not to.",2242
6088,So I never said nothing.,2242
6089,CHAPTER THE LAST,2244
6090,"The first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea,time of the evasion?—what it was he’d planned to do if the evasionworked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was alreadyfree before?",2245
6091,"And he said, what he had planned in his head from thestart, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the riveron the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, andthen tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on asteamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write wordahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him intotown with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he wouldbe a hero, and so would we.",2245
6092,But I reckoned it was about as well the wayit was.,2245
6093,"We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and UncleSilas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give himall he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.",2246
6094,"And we hadhim up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim fortydollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:",2246
6095,"“_Dah_, now, Huck, what I tell you?—what I tell you up dah on Jacksonislan’?",2247
6096,"I _tole_ you I got a hairy breas’, en what’s de sign un it; enI _tole_ you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich _agin;_ en it’scome true; en heah she _is!",2247

6098,"doan’ talk to _me_—signs is_signs_, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis’ ’s well ’at I ’uz gwineterbe rich agin as I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minute!”",2247
6099,"And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all threeslide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go forhowling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for acouple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but Iain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t getnone from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and gotit all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.",2248
6100,"“No, he hain’t,” Tom says; “it’s all there yet—six thousand dollars andmore; and your pap hain’t ever been back since.",2249
6101,"Hadn’t when I comeaway, anyhow.”",2249
6102,"Jim says, kind of solemn:",2250
6103,"“He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.”",2251
6104,I says:,2252
6105,"“Why, Jim?”",2253
6106,"“Nemmine why, Huck—but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.”",2254
6107,But I kept at him; so at last he says:,2255
6108,"“Doan’ you ’member de house dat was float’n down de river, en dey wuz aman in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn’ let youcome in?",2256
6109,"Well, den, you kin git yo’ money when you wants it, kase datwuz him.”",2256
6110,"Tom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on awatch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and sothere ain’t nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it,because if I’d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’ta tackled it, and ain’t a-going to no more.",2257
6111,"But I reckon I got to lightout for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s goingto adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it.",2257
